WEBVTT

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.730
My foolish little brother...

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.730
Wow, Brother!

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.370
You nailed every target, even the one in the blind spot behind the rock!

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.330
All right, my turn!

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.300
Sasuke.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.800
It's time to go.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.200
You said that you would teach me a new shuriken jutsu.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.500
I have an important mission tomorrow that I must prepare for.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.200
You're a liar...

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.370
Sorry, Sasuke.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.730
- Maybe some other time. - Ow!

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.670
Big Brother, watch this!

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.970
Hey!

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.430
Don't be reckless...

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.470
The Longest Moment...

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.670
How come the one who twisted his ankle is the one laughing?

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.670
Was it on purpose so I'd carry you?

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.570
No. I'm just happy 'cuz tomorrow I'll be starting the academy too.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.830
Maybe now, I can catch up to you a little.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.230
Itachi... Have you made up your mind?

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.100
If not, then we will act instead-- No, please wait.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.200
It will be too late once things start to move...

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.370
The situation is dire!

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.530
I realize that...

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.100
I shall settle this with my own hands.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.870
What?!

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.170
Do you know what day tomorrow is?!

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.300
You don't understand your own position!

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.830
I'm setting out on a mission tomorrow.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.470
What kind of mission?

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.330
I can't tell you... It's a top-secret mission.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.400
Itachi... You also serve as the Uchiha clan's pipeline

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.730
to the Village nerve center.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.570
You know that, don't you?

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.700
Yes...

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.530
Keep that well in mind.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.570
And come to tomorrow's assembly!

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.270
Father only cares about you, Big Brother...

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.370
You probably hate me, huh?

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.770
It's all right...

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.870
It's a fact that ninja go through life being hated.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.500
That's not how I feel...

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.830
Being the best isn't all it's cracked up to be...

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.700
If you have power, you become alienated and also arrogant.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.030
Even if you're coveted and sought after at first.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.400
But, we only have each other as siblings.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.330
I'm always going to be there for you,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.130
even if it's only as an obstacle for you to overcome.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.670
Even if you do hate me...

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.500
That's what big brothers are for.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.530
Is Itachi here?!

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.030
We need to talk. Come out!

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.230
What brings you all here?

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.800
There were two people who didn't show up at yesterday's assembly.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.870
Why didn't you come?

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.770
We understand that joining the Anbu Black Ops means

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.600
being pushed to do all sorts of petty assignments.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.230
Your father has said as much and tries to defend you.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.030
But we have no intention of giving you special treatment.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.200
I understand. I shall be more careful hereafter.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.130
Now, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.200
All right.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.430
But before that, we'd like to ask you a bit more about something.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.630
It's about Shisui Uchiha

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.730
who died after throwing himself into the Nakano River last night.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.200
As I recall, you looked up to him like an older brother, didn't you?

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.200
I see...

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.500
I hadn't seen him recently...

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.700
That's too bad.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.670
And we, the Police Force, have decided to launch an all-out investigation.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.170
Investigation?!

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.200
This is the will Shisui left.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.130
The handwriting analysis shows that it is unmistakably his.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.900
If there are no signs of foul play, why investigate at all?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.130
Someone who uses Sharingan would be able to make a perfect copy.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.000
I HAVE WEARIED OF DUTY. AS IT IS, THE UCHIHA HAS NO FUTURE. NEITHER DO I... I CAN NO LONGER FOLLOW THE "PATH." The most talented of all our clan, feared as Shisui the Teleporter...

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.070
He was a man who took on any mission for the sake of the clan.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.000
It's hard to believe that someone like that would kill himself,

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.330
leaving this behind.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.000
You shouldn't judge people by their appearance,

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.070
or by your own preconceptions.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.370
Anyway, we'll leave his will with you.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.770
Take it to the Anbu

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.030
and request their cooperation in the investigation!

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.030
Understood...

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.730
Let's hope we get a lead on this soon.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.170
Why don't you just come out and say it?

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.830
You all suspect me, right?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.830
Yeah, that's right. You little punk!

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.470
Like I said earlier,

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.970
appearances and preconception aren't going to tell you anything.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.000
You assume that I'm very patient and underestimate me...

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.370
The clan...the clan...

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.800
You keep harping on it,

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.900
mistaking the size of that vessel and underestimating the size of mine.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.830
That's why you're here now, groveling.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.030
Shisui had been monitoring you lately.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.270
It's been six months since you joined the Anbu,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.170
but your recent words and actions have been intolerable.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.030
Just what are you thinking?

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.630
This attachment to the organization, to the clan, to one's name...

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.670
Such attachments put a limit on one's vessel and should be shunned.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.730
To fear and hate things that we cannot see or understand as yet

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:35.830
is totally ridiculous!

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:36.730
Stop! Itachi!

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.970
That's enough... What is going on with you?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.400
Itachi... You haven't been yourself lately.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.470
I'm perfectly sane.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.770
I'm carrying out my duties. That's all I'm doing.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.630
Then why didn't you come last night?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.970
In order to elevate myself higher...

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.830
What are you talking about?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.970
My vessel is dismayed at this foolish clan!

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.570
Adhering to this clan... and petty things...

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.970
makes you lose sight of what's truly important.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.570
Real change won't come about when you're bound by regulations and limitation...

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.070
when you're satisfied with premonition and guesses.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.400
Such arrogance!

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.870
Enough.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.070
Say another word and we'll throw you in prison!

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.930
So, what will you do?!

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.630
I've had enough! Captain, give us the order to arrest him!

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.200
Big Brother! Please stop!

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.600
I did not kill Shisui...

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.630
But I apologize for the words I have spoken...

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.270
I'm truly sorry.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.700
You've been working too hard on your Anbu Black Ops missions,

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.370
and I think you're a little tired.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.370
But Captain!

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.270
The Anbu Black Ops is under the direct orders of the Hokage.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.570
Without an arrest warrant, we cannot detain him.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.730
I will take full responsibility over Itachi and keep an eye on him.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.870
You have my word.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.470
Very well, sir.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.200
Let's go inside, Itachi.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.430
Itachi...

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.230
I'll leave your meal here.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:00.630
I know you're busy with work, but do join us for meals once in a while.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:05.570
Thank you...

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.330
Mother.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.070
I stayed back to practice throwing shuriken

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.770
and now I'm totally late.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.400
I had a feeling there was someone there...

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.130
What is this?!

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.270
Father! Mother!

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.230
Big Brother! Father and Mother are...!

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.630
Why? What happened?!

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.830
Who would do such a thing?!

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.030
Foolish little brother...

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.100
Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.030
He's worthy of being my son.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.670
Your father only talks about you.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.800
Stop it, Big Brother! Why are you showing me all of this?!

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.300
Why...?

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.430
Why did you do this?

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.900
To measure my abilities...

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.700
Measure your abilities? That's all?

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.500
Just for that... you...killed everyone?

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.270
It is of great importance.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.600
It's a lie! This isn't like you, Big Brother...

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.400
It can't be...!

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.800
I acted like the older brother you desired...

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.670
in order to measure your vessel.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.870
You will become a rival to measure my vessel against...

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.570
You have that hidden potential.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.000
You've been jealous of me and resented me.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.130
You've harbored hopes of surpassing me.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.730
That is why I am allowing you to live. For my sake...

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.970
Like me, you will awaken the powers of the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.730
However, on one condition...

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.700
You must kill...your closest friend!

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.500
As I did...

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.230
Then...you...

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.970
You killed Shisui?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.670
As a result, I possess this "eye."

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.870
In the main hall in Nakano Shrine

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.500
beneath the seventh tatami mat from the inner right side

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.830
is the clan's hidden meeting room.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:12.200
There you will find the record of the Uchiha Clan's Visual Jutsu

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.930
and its true purpose.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.530
If you awaken the Mangekyo Sharingan,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.900
there will be three, including myself, who possess its powers.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.630
Then...

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.930
there will be meaning in letting you live.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.470
There is no value in killing you now...

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.070
my foolish little brother.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.530
If you wish to kill me, resent me, hate me,

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.070
and survive...in obscurity.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.500
Run...keep running...

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.830
and cling to life.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.930
Then one day, come before me with the same eye that I possess.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:21.070
That Sharingan... How much can you actually see?

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.830
How much can I see with these?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.200
What I'm seeing right now, Itachi...

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.430
is your death.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.230
My death, huh?

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.100
Well then...

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.030
make it happen.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.330
Chidori!

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.830
Chidori Stream!

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.630
You've become...strong.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.570
Itachi... I have one last thing to ask...

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.600
You've become...strong

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.730
The same line as before... and the bird...

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.630
Another farce with your special genjutsu?

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.700
What do you want to know?

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.370
It's not over, but I'll hear you out.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.500
I'll say it once more...

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:07.930
Genjutsu...

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.930
I have one last thing to ask...

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.230
That's what I said, you bastard!

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.870
Answer my question.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.700
That pain in your chest won't subside until you answer.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.800
So you purposely missed a vital spot...

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.230
You said back then...

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.800
If you awaken the Mangekyo Sharingan,

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.230
there will be three, including myself, who possess its powers.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:33.330
Then...

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.770
there will be meaning in letting you live.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.900
The third person... The other one with a Sharingan...

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.270
Who in the Uchiha Clan is it?

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.600
Why...the curiosity about such a thing?

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:53.400
I'm going to kill him after you. That's why.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.100
Kill?

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.000
When you killed off the entire clan,

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.970
you mentioned the existence of another person.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:08.470
So that Uchiha member you didn't kill was a co-conspirator.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.930
Even you could not kill the entire Police Force alone.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.730
So you figured it out...

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.270
Who is it?!

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.630
It's Madara Uchiha...

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:36.070
With that vision and chakra more ominous than my own...

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.730
It's just like...Madara Uchiha, from long ago...

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.270
Heck if I know...that person.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.800
Madara...Uchiha?!

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.100
One of the founders of Hidden Leaf Village...

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.670
The man who first possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.500
Madara Uchiha...

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.830
The only man to uncover the other secret of the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.730
If that's Madara, the founder of the Hidden Leaf,

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.270
he should be long dead.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.630
Who would believe such a story?

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.700
Madara is alive...

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.200
It's up to you whether you believe that or not.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.430
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Light &amp; Dark of the Mangekyo Sharingan"

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.430
Let me tell you a little about the past...

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.370
Tune in again!
