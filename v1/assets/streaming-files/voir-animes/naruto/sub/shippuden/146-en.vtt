WEBVTT

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.800
Sakura… What is it?

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.670
Perhaps it would have been better to tell Naruto the truth.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.130
There's no way I could have told him.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.970
Absolutely no way.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.630
Sakura…

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.030
You're underestimating Naruto.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.970
I found Sasuke.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.800
That Tobi guy is next to him.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.530
Stop, everyone!

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.000
What's wrong? Why did you stop?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.400
We already went over our formation.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.600
Kiba… What is Sasuke's precise location?

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.930
Facing directly north, he's at 2 o'clock.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.470
Up one kilometer.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.970
Okay.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.500
Forgive me, everyone!

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.370
I knew it. You were going to use this

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.900
to make everyone fall asleep, weren't you?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.000
Sai!

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.700
Huh?!

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.000
What's going on?

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.370
Sakura was going to take care of Sasuke herself.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.830
Why would you go alone?

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.400
Yes, why? We promised to do it together!

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.570
No, you can't.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.830
I won't let anyone proceed.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.570
Why not?

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.670
You… I always thought you were suspicious.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.330
The four of us alone are no match against Sasuke or this Tobi.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.770
I promised Kakashi Sensei that I wouldn't let any of you go.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.930
What?

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.730
Is that the reason?

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.230
Sai…

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.930
I'll say this only once.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.370
Move aside.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.300
We must hurry.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.630
It's becoming a rather dire situation.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.100
No.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.830
I won't let you go.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.730
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.170
You're going to bind us with those snakes?

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.270
I understand where Kakashi Sensei's coming from,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.330
but we just can't keep letting Sasuke go.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.470
I'll take care of him!

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.930
Why not, Akamaru?! Don't be so scared!

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.370
The dog is smarter.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.370
It seems he understands what I'm saying.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.700
Shut up!

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.930
Let's go, Lee.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.900
Sure thing! Yeah!

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.600
I'll take care of this with Tunneling Fang!

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.170
Good diversion, Kiba!

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.130
Here!

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.630
Damn it!

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.030
I'm sorry…everyone.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.570
Kiba and Lee too.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.070
She got us. Please hurry!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.330
I'm impressed, Sakura.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.230
Sakura's Resolve

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.330
Sasuke…

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.000
When did I fall in love with you?

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.130
Back in those days,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.270
I was just infatuated with how cool you were.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.370
Listen up, everyone!

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.030
I'm in love!

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.070
Who do you think it is?

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.430
Keep it brief.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.770
And don't say it's Sasuke.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.530
How did you know?

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.970
Next, Team 7.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.270
Sakura Haruno,

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.870
Naruto Uzumaki.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.730
Yes!

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.300
And Sasuke Uchiha.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.300
Cha!

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.730
Then…you became my teammate.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.270
I'm Sakura Haruno.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.700
What I like... I mean, who I like is...

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.400
My future dream is...

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.200
On Team 7.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.170
Today's assignment is

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.070
to take these bells away from me by noon.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.800
Those who can't do it won't get lunch.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.900
Here.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.770
H-Hey, Sasuke. Sensei just said…

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.000
It's okay. There's no sign of him now.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.970
In the afternoon, the three of us will go and get the bells.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.800
It'll be trouble for me if he becomes a hindrance, so...

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.370
Sasuke…

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.000
What?!

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.900
You guys!

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.070
You pass.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.300
We passed?! Why?!

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.900
A ninja must see through deception.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.970
In the ninja world, those who break the rules are scum.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.000
But those who abandon their friends are worse than scum.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.700
Being teammates didn't change me.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.430
I was still hopelessly in love with the cool Sasuke.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.170
Just gazing at his handsome profile was enough for me.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.800
I never gave a thought

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.870
to who he really was behind that pensive face.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:40.300
But…

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.470
Sasuke will definitely come looking for me…

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.300
in search of power.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.400
You! What did you do to Sasuke?

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.770
I gave him a parting gift.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.230
Sasuke!

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.770
S-Sasuke?!

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.400
Hang on, Sasuke!

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.230
Please!

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.870
At last I understand. I'm an avenger.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.470
With the path I'm on, I must acquire power at any price,

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.530
even if it means being consumed by evil.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.870
You're the only one left.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.530
Make it a little more fun for me.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.330
Stop!

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.570
Stop it, please!

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.470
Don't say anything about this bruise.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.030
Why are you pretending to be tough?

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.170
I don't want to watch you suffer all the time anymore!

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.670
To me, you are… This has nothing to do with you!

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.370
Mind your own business.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.470
Sasuke!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.270
The shadow that you carried…

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.000
When I finally noticed, it was too late.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.830
W-What?!

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.130
Fight me… Right now!

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.270
This is perfect, I was just thinking that I wanted to fight you!

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.570
Damn it!

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.100
Stop it, both of you!

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.570
That Chidori you used earlier…

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.700
It was bigger than what you'd normally direct

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.530
at a comrade from the same village.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.700
Were you thinking of killing Naruto?

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.200
Naruto knew… He knew about your shadow.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.230
Sakura…

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.930
Don't interfere.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.830
Before I knew it,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.700
Naruto had matured and was standing face-to-face with you.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.970
I was the one left behind. Yet I didn't change.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.700
I'm not the same as you.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.200
I'm traveling a path the rest of you can't follow.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.570
I love you so much, Sasuke!

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.630
If you stay with me,

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.330
I won't let you regret it, no matter what!

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.500
Everyday will be fun and we'll be happy!

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.570
I'll even help you get revenge!

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.930
I'll make it happen somehow, I promise you!

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.600
So please…

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.770
Stay here with me.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.670
And if you can't…

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.300
take me with you.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.500
You're still annoying.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.570
Please…

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.130
Please bring Sasuke back.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.130
I'll bring Sasuke back without fail!

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.130
I promise that on my life!

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.330
I didn't think about it and I put the entire burden on Naruto.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.430
I went crying to you.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.270
I held onto you, expecting you to make it all better.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.970
While I did nothing.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.970
That's why this time…

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.470
I'm sorry, Naruto.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.700
You may have to wait for me a little bit.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.670
Next time I'm coming with you.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.670
I tried to catch up to the two of you in my own way.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.430
But Sasuke…

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.630
is no longer the person we think he is

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.930
and he's far beyond our reach.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.470
It doesn't matter,

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.600
even if there's no promise between us anymore.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.430
I personally want to save Sasuke.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.300
Forget it! I'm going back.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.430
Naruto… I'm sorry!

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.770
But also…thank you.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:29.670
But I've already decided. I'll take care of Sasuke myself!

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.130
That was a close call.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.270
For the sake of the ninja world… for sake of the Hidden Leaf…

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.170
I will not let you both live!

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.470
This is the Reverse Tetragram Sealing Jutsu.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.830
Sasuke! Get away from Danzo!

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.400
That was the Collateral Damage Sealing Jutsu.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.000
He would've dragged you into his corpse and sealed you inside.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.000
He probably set it up to activate at the moment of his death.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.130
That was close.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.600
We'll head for Hidden Leaf Village next.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.800
The Hidden Leaf, huh?

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.700
I'm taking his eye.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.730
Sasuke, don't be hasty. Go back to the hideout and rest.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.770
You used up too much of your visual prowess.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.830
Eventually you won't be able to keep it up.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.200
Your eye is losing its light.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.470
What can you do by yourself now?

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.700
Patience is necessary to reach one's goal.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.770
Sasuke…

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.170
I'm going to give you a bit of advice.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.570
That woman…

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.100
If you don't need her, make sure you finish her off.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.470
She knows too much about us.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.770
"Us"? When did I join you?

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.570
Well, nevermind.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.430
We'll meet again.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.570
EARTH

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.530
Hey! Where is everyone?!

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.230
Lion's Barrage!

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.070
An Earth Scroll, just like us, huh?

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.730
M-My glasses!

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.070
– Later. – Later.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.970
I wish I could've seen your face from back then,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.130
just one more time.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.800
Sasuke!

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.600
It's you, Sakura.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.830
He feels totally different.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.970
Is this really Sasuke?

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.670
What are you doing here?

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.470
Who is she?

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.600
Sasuke!

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.230
I'm coming with you! I'm deserting the Hidden Leaf!

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.930
You're finally awake, Naruto?

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.930
Where am I?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.300
You lost consciousness. You really had us worried.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.000
Captain Yamato, where are Kakashi Sensei and Sai?

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.500
Did they leave already?

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.030
You're going back to the village with me.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.730
Kakashi's orders.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.700
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Lost Bonds"

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.670
You just have to let Kakashi handle Sakura.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.730
What?! The champion got knocked out in one round?

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.330
Damn it, how pathetic!

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.370
He lacks fighting spirit, fighting spirit!

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.530
WAYS TO MAKE A GIRL'S HEART STIR …get close to their ear and whisper.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.030
I understand now!

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.870
Hey there… When you punch,

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.270
you have to put your back into it and strike!

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.970
Oh Sai! I'm so sorry, are you okay?

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.930
It wasn't on purpose!

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.000
Get a hold of yourself!

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.370
NICE TREASURE So the featured pinup is sealed huh?

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.270
Man, this is bugging me!

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.270
Damn it, there's gotta be a way I can see it.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.500
Byakugan!
Sai!

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.500
Yeah right, like I can use that.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.070
I guess I have no other choice.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.870
Hey Sai! C'mon, get up!

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:55.900
Let me see.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.530
The contents that made me so curious are…

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:00.930
What the hell is this?!

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.370
How is this a "Nice Treasure"? I want my money back!

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.970
Tune in again!
