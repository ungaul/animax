WEBVTT

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.210
There they are!

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.160
It figures they'd be here.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620
Thanks, Sakura.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.870
Sakura… Never mind me… Stay quiet now.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.960
I need to concentrate.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.870
I'm sorry…

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.960
Sorry? For what?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.910
For everything…

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.870
You should be.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.210
Really...you…

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.250
damn…

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.580
idiot!

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.250
He's finally back.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.250
Naruto…

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.080
I've been thinking about what you once said to me.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.120
When we were together,

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.120
you wondered if it was how having a brother would feel…

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.460
Now, finally… I think I know what you meant.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.330
I felt how my mother, father, and brother Itachi suffered.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.000
In that same way…

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.710
Naruto…

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.290
I'm sure I will start to feel your pain and your emotions…

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.960
You never cut me off.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.080
You always kept me in your thoughts.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.620
Naruto…

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.410
SHIKAKU NARA

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.290
INOICHI YAMANAKA

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.620
You'd have been justified if you'd come at me with hatred…

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.910
Instead, you always called me your friend.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.870
NEJI HYUGA

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.040
And I tried to betray even those feelings…

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.080
As I explained, it's the village policy.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.750
Only those authorized are allowed at the interview.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.710
All others, please leave!

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.210
What? Do you know how far I traveled?

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.080
Let us see him, just once!

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.460
– Yeah! – Yeah!

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.370
It's the village policy…

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.830
– Let us see Naruto! – Let us see Naruto!

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.370
Please don't push! It's dangerous.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.040
This should take care of the successorship.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.660
It's a lot of paper.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.120
Yeah…

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.040
Anyway, congratulations on becoming the Sixth Hokage, Kakashi.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.830
Thank you.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.660
I just wonder… Can I do this?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.540
You'll manage. After all, I did.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.120
I'll do my best.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.160
Excuse me.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.660
Status report:

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.830
The Raikage's entourage and

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.460
the Kazekage's entourage have arrived.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.330
May I escort them to Naruto, too?

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:34.790
You may.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.750
Further…

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.330
I have a request.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.370
I see, Shikamaru.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.000
I understand your intentions.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.910
I want to get some experience and improve my prospects too.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.870
All that's left is him.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.000
A ton of visitors are asking about him.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.500
Suddenly he's Mr. Popular.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.960
That's all right.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.040
He's not the type to get carried away.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.750
Hey! Gaara!

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.750
Naruto…

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.040
You…saved me yet again.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.410
And us.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.210
How's your wound?

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.040
It's about what you'd guess.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.750
Can't say I'm in the best shape.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.500
Then, what'll you do about that arm?

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.830
Oh, Grandma Tsunade said something about

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:04.870
harvesting cells from Hashirama, the First Hokage, or whatever.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.330
She's gonna fuse them with mine, I suppose?

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.040
I don't really understand.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.660
Will it be as good as new?

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.370
Yeah! I think.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.830
I'm here today so they can check.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:21.790
I see…

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.460
Naruto is the Ninja World's sun! His right hand's a precious companion!

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.710
Losing it is devastation! Yay!

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.210
So to get it back intact! Use Hashirama's cells, in fact.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.710
It'll be as good as new, Jack! Yay!

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.580
What's he up to?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.040
I really don't wanna say much.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.210
SEAL SEAL I promised I wouldn't.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:01.960
SEAL

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.660
I see.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.210
S-Sensei!

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.410
Don't cry, Lee!

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.910
Even if the bright days of youth end here, there is still a future for me!

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.410
The sun that shines bright!

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.460
The sweltering heat!

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.500
The red-hot days of summer are here!

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.910
O-Oww…

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.960
Guy Sensei!

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.710
I'm inspired! What a brilliant way of thinking!

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.830
Oh yuck…

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.620
NINJA ACADEMY NINJA ACADEMY Shikamaru…

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.910
I hear you're the Hokage's personal assistant.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.750
Well, yeah.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.870
I have to keep moving forward too.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.580
So why'd you ask me to come to the Academy?

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.040
Iruka Sensei? And Kakashi Sensei?

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.210
More like Lord Hokage now.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.910
Huh?! When did that—?!

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.830
You must have seen all the messages that came in this morning.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.540
I had no idea… Don't worry about it.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.410
So what do I call you?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.290
Kakashi Hokage?

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.620
Hokage Kakashi Teacher?

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.040
Well, let's decide that later.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.710
Naruto!

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.500
You never got to take the Chunin Exam, right?

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.870
No…

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.960
Naruto Uzumaki!

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.870
I, the Sixth Hokage, hereby grant you

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.790
the rank of Jonin of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.960
…is what I'd like to tell you.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.910
But there's something you must complete before that.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.910
The educational materials you'll be needing.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.750
You mean…?

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.910
Yes, you have study.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.540
Study?!

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.040
No way!

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.910
No way, no way!

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.910
If I'm gonna have to study, I'll just stay a genin!

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.870
Hold on, Naruto.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.870
There's no shortcut to becoming the Hokage!

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.830
Got it?!

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.080
Naruto…

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.250
I don't have to tell you

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.870
that your skill as a shinobi is second to none.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.410
However, if your goal is to become the Hokage…

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.040
You must learn how to stand above others and lead them.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.870
You catch on fast, and for most things,

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.250
Shikamaru will support you with his resourcefulness.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.790
Still, a minimum of learning and knowledge is essential.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.870
We're rivals who both aim to become Hokage, right?!

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.660
THE HISTORY OF SHINOBI VOLUME 1

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.000
You really dug in, Naruto.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.330
Two more years, and you can become a jonin.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.000
So long…

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.290
Okay, let's call it a day and go grab some ramen.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.370
Yes!

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.410
NINJA ACADEMY Now what toppings should I choose?

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.830
Now what toppings should I choose?

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.210
Hey, don't get carried away.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.540
It's all thanks to you, Iruka Sensei.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:11.830
Huh?

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.120
Do you remember that day?

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:16.830
Hmm?

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:21.830
That night, Sensei… You accepted me.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.830
It was the first time ever.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.960
That's why I'm here today.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.910
If no one acknowledged me and I stayed the way I was…

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.120
Maybe I would've resented the village and everyone in it, and gone wild.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:43.830
But your words that night changed me.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.250
But Naruto is different.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.580
He's…

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.500
He's an exceptional student and I acknowledge him!

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.290
He is…

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.750
Naruto Uzumaki of the Hidden Leaf!

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.870
Thank you, Iruka Sensei.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.290
That…that does it!

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.040
Today, you can have all the toppings you want!

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.000
Awright!

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.750
Sasuke…

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.120
I'll be blunt.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.290
By rights, you should be in prison right now.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.830
But we have heard your plea and

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.160
all your actions up to now have been pardoned.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.120
Breaking the jutsu for the Infinite Tsukuyomi

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.830
played a big part in the decision.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.500
As well as the fact that I happened to become the Sixth Hokage,

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.710
and that Naruto, the key figure in ending the war,

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.120
testified on your behalf.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.960
Don't forget that.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.750
And please don't get too reckless.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.210
Otherwise, I'll be held responsible.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.830
Understood. Thank you.

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.040
Must you go?

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.080
The artificial arm that Lady Tsunade is creating

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.370
from Lord Hashirama's cells will soon…

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.160
I need time to understand my feelings.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.580
How I should view the shinobi world, this world.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.580
Perhaps I'll be able to see things I couldn't see before.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.500
Things that can't be seen unless I do this.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.120
Also, there's something I'm worried about.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.500
What if I said…I'd go with you?

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.710
This is a trip to atone for my sins.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.460
My sins have nothing to do with you.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.830
Nothing to do with me…?

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.080
Maybe next time.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:21.910
Thank you.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.580
I didn't think you'd come to see me off.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.080
Here.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.830
You kept that thing?

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.000
You sacrificed your arm to stop me.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.250
Thanks to you, I found salvation.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.540
Once, all we did was clash with each other.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.750
But now, we share each other's pain.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.620
After all my travels through the world,

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:24.960
I came to the conclusion

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.410
that this sharing of pain

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.960
can perhaps be applied to something much bigger than just us.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.870
But I can't do things like you.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.960
Things don't go that smoothly,

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.330
as you and I know more than anyone…

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.040
The bigger something is, the harder.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.660
I'm returning this.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.870
I'll hang on to it…

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.620
…until our real match.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.960
This idea is almost a prayer.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.080
To keep enduring, no matter what, until things come to pass.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.040
And for we who must endure,

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.660
perhaps that's what it means…

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.710
…to be a ninja.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:03.080
Long ago, there was a fox spirit. This fox had nine tails.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.460
The fox was sealed inside a shinobi's child

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.830
and over time, they became close friends.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.540
Then a new calamity occurred. The Ten Tails was resurrected.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.660
But the child grew up to be a shinobi,

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:24.290
and the fox spirit, the child, and the clans joined to seal away the Ten Tails.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.870
This son of the Fourth Hokage

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.290
into whom the fox spirit was sealed, was named…

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.330
Naruto Uzumaki.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.910
Hmm… Now this looks delicious.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.500
Well, it's the fish I caught.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.250
‘Course it's gonna be good!

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.000
I will make you strong.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.830
In times of danger, I will risk my life to protect you.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:59.710
Brother Neji…

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.040
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "NARUTO - HINATA"

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:28.540
