WEBVTT

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.030
You actually tailed Samui. You guys are pretty good.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.930
Y-You... You're Naruto!

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.800
You tailed us! What's the big idea?!

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.600
Boss, the one on the right... is Kakashi Hatake.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.670
I know that!

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.770
Did the Hokage send you, Kakashi Hatake?

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.430
No, I came to ask you personally

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.070
about a request by Naruto Uzumaki of the Hidden Leaf.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.670
Naruto Uzumaki?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.870
If you could hear him out for just a while.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.500
Isn't this a bit rude?

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.270
Stopping us en route to the summit without any prior notice.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.830
I am fully aware of that.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.200
No matter.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.830
You there, boy! Speak!

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.800
Sasuke...

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.430
I want you to cancel the disposal of Sasuke Uchiha!

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.200
H-Hey, this isn't really the place...

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.870
Are you still talking about that?!

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.770
You sure got guts.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.470
What are you saying?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.230
I know it sounds ridiculous!

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.370
But this is the only way I know how to say it!

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.130
Sasuke is my friend!

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.500
My friend's gonna get killed.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.230
I can't just stand by and let it happen!

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.270
On top of that, I don't want Sasuke to be

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.530
the cause of the Leaf and Cloud Villages killing each other.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.200
I don't want my friends, or the Cloud to fight for revenge!

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.330
I'm begging you!

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.900
I don't want us killing each other out of vengeance anymore!

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.670
All Sasuke ever thought about was revenge!

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.100
He became obsessed with it and that changed him.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.800
Vengeance makes you go mad.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.670
It turns you into someone you don't recognize anymore.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.830
I don't want anyone else to become like Sasuke!

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.000
I don't want the Leaf and Cloud Villages to destroy each other!

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.000
That's why...

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.530
I have work to do, so I'm going on ahead.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.670
Please report to Kakashi Sensei about the mission.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.930
Sure! You can count on me.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.070
See you.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.770
Say Naruto...

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.730
You like Sakura, don't you?

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.770
What?!

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.770
It was in a book.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.730
When you're with someone you like, you always smile.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.170
You're like that.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.030
Did you tell her how you feel?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.800
How could I?

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.500
I'm a guy who couldn't even keep my promise to her.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.730
Sai... Stay out of this.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.070
No. I can't just sit still either, Naruto.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.670
We will dispose of Sasuke!

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.470
After that, you can stop the cycle.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.130
What a fool.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800
We are in a hurry. We've let you have your say.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.700
Lord Raikage...

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.430
The incident in which you tried to obtain the Hyuga Byakugan

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.500
is still unresolved on our side.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.070
The Hidden Leaf swallowed tears of blood and

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.930
avoided fighting the Cloud, who fueled the fires of war.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.030
It's thanks to those noble sacrifices that your people still exist.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.930
Please try not to forget that.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.170
Right here and now, this young ninja,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.730
no matter how awkwardly, is bowing his head in his affection

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.900
for the Cloud and Leaf, village and nation.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.030
Lord Raikage...

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.200
As one of the five Kage, what do you think of this?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.600
A ninja does not bow his head so easily!

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.830
A ninja values action and strength!

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.300
Concessions are forbidden in agreements made between ninja.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.200
The history of man is a history of war.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.530
Since the three Great Ninja Wars

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.970
every nation, and every land has tried to obtain powerful ninjutsu.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.570
Those without power are crushed.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.300
That is the truth of the ninja world.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.170
The Akatsuki will be branded as wanted fugitives.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.130
Then, not only I,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.300
but the whole world will hunt Sasuke down.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.570
Yet you bow your head for this criminal

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.200
and plead for mercy for your friend.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.470
In the ninja world, that is not friendship!

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.670
Boy from the Hidden Leaf, think hard on what you must do!

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.230
The ninja world does not indulge fools!

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.500
Let's go!

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.230
Naruto...

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.900
Enough already.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.900
Raise your head.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.830
We have been waiting for you.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.930
He's the one. The old one in the middle.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.400
So that's...Danzo!

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:05.230
SAMURAI Please remove your Kage hats.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.600
LIGHTNING

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.830
In response to Lord Raikage's request,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.030
WATER In response to Lord Raikage's request,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.000
the five Kage have assembled here.
EARTH the five Kage have assembled here.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.770
the five Kage have assembled here.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.130
WIND

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.300
FIRE

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.000
I am Mifune, your moderator.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.100
The Five Kage Summit Conference is called into order.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.870
Naruto's Plea

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.770
I am Mifune, your moderator.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.370
The Five Kage Summit Conference is called into order.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.730
I shall speak first. Hear me.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.700
There's such a difference in Kage these days.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.930
To be a Kage at your age

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:52.000
is quite an accomplishment, Lord Kazekage.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.970
It seems your father trained you extremely well,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.730
except in the area of proper etiquette.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.800
You're probably right.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.870
It is the reason why I can be here as Kagekaze.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.800
You certainly are cocky.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.170
Lord Tsuchikage, there's no need to make fun of him.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.130
Continue, Lord Kazekage.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.730
I am a former Jinchuriki.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.400
I was captured by the Akatsuki,

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.470
- they took my Tailed Beast -The nerve of that Tsuchikage!

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.670
- and nearly killed me. -Quiet!

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:31.570
So I consider the Akatsuki extremely dangerous.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.570
I sought the cooperation of the five Kage many times,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.170
but was ignored.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.470
Except by the previous Hokage.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.930
At a time when various lands have had their Jinchuriki stolen

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.230
the response by this group has been far too slow!

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.400
How can the Hidden Villages of the Five Great Nations serve

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.630
as an example when they allow their Jinchuriki to be taken?

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.170
It is an embarrassment!

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.700
It is common sense to resolve this in utmost secrecy.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.500
Seeking the help of other lands just because of that is nonsense!

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.200
Saving face... Prestige...

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.900
Such old-fashioned beliefs.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.370
Such a brat.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.930
Old-fashioned beliefs aside...

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.430
I will acknowledge that as the Mizukage,

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.200
I have delayed action.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:27.570
However, having our Tailed Beast stolen is no cause for immediate fear.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:33.370
Controlling a Tailed Beast requires skill, knowledge and time.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.970
The Jinchuriki and the Tailed Beast must mature together

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.170
and adapt to each other.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.170
And still, controlling the Tailed Beast is difficult.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.100
It is not a simple task.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.730
Isn't that so, Lord Kazekage?

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.800
The only ones who were capable of controlling a Tailed Beast were

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.670
Madara Uchiha and the First Hokage, Senju Hashirama.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.600
Also Fourth Mizukage Yagura,

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.530
and Lord Raikage's younger brother, Killer Bee.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.470
However...

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.030
- Chojuro! - Right!

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.300
Enough...

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.130
of this!

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.700
This is a place of discussion.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.700
Please refrain from disruptive actions.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.570
Stand down, Foo, Torune.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.670
You too, Kankuro, Temari.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.730
Ao, Chojuro. I'm fine.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.000
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.030
Let us continue our discussion.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.170
The Hidden Leaf, Rock, Sand and Mist...

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.870
Rogue Ninja from your villages make up the Akatsuki!

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.600
And that is not all!

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.300
From our investigations, we know that among you,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.230
including your previous Kage, there are those who used the Akatsuki!

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.170
Used them?!

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.800
I do not trust you!

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.700
I had no intention of even discussing this with you.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.530
But the reason I convened this summit

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.400
is to question your loyalty!

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.170
What do you mean, "used" the Akatsuki?

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.900
You are the Kazekage, yet you have not been informed?

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.100
Ask the elders back home!

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.400
You used the Akatsuki in the past war!

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.300
The Great Nations are heading towards uniform stability.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.900
They are moving from military expansion to military disarmament.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.770
As fear and the threat of war diminishes between nations,

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.730
Hidden Villages, which are the source of its military strength,

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.670
become costly hindrances.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:29.170
And yet, carelessly downsizing the villages poses a risk.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.570
What if war suddenly breaks out?

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.930
It would be a problem to depend on ninja

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:35.630
who have no experience in war.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.270
It would mean certain defeat!

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:44.970
And one way to reduce that risk is mercenary soldiers.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.700
Namely, the Akatsuki?

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:08.100
It takes effort and money to train skilled ninja from your own village.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.900
But the Akatsuki, which makes war its livelihood,

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.230
is made up of experienced professionals.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.370
Furthermore, they can be hired for cheap.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.200
Best of all, they return exceptional results.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Get serious, Tsuchikage!

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.270
The Sand used the Akatsuki to destroy the Hidden Leaf.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.770
I'm speaking of Orochimaru!

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.870
It is not clear if he had broken away from the Akatsuki or not.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.400
But as a result, your father, the Fourth Kazekage,

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.230
and the Third Hokage Hiruzen, died.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.330
And frankly, it's hard not to rule out the idea

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.030
that this was someone's scheme.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.230
The old fox.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.470
The most suspicious is the Hidden Mist!

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.300
You Mist do not conduct diplomacy.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.100
There are even rumors that the Akatsuki originated there!

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.500
Since we have come this far I will speak honestly.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.930
Is Lady Fifth going to reveal...

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.000
There were suspicions that

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:29.970
someone was manipulating Yagura, our Fourth Mizukage.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.830
And there was a possibility that it was the Akatsuki.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.800
No one wanted this to get blown out of proportion.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.330
Each and every one of you... Hold your tongue, Raikage!

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:49.070
Ultimately, it is because your village disregarded the disarmament efforts

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.500
and sought powerful ninjutsu.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.630
We had no choice but to counter by hiring the Akatsuki!

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.230
What?!

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.330
Before we start arguing about the situation,

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.770
there is a statement I have been waiting to make.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.000
What is it?

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.830
The leader of the Akatsuki is...

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.000
probably Madara Uchiha.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.000
Are you sure of that?

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.130
Hasn't he been dead for several decades?

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.800
He is right.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.970
He died long ago.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.530
I do not know the details.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.300
But the information is quite reliable.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.970
Are you saying he is immortal?!

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.870
Perhaps.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.030
To think...that he was really a monster.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.370
I want to speak on behalf of the neutral nations.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.070
The leader of the Akatsuki was able to read the times well.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.830
Despite stabilization, nations had private suspicions

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:20.270
and the Akatsuki took advantage of that weakness to amass its power.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.130
What are you trying to say?!

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.600
Calm down.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.030
Turn calamity into good fortune.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:33.200
It is extremely rare for all five Kage to assemble.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.670
What do you say?

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.600
Until the Akatsuki is eliminated, why not establish

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:44.500
the world's first Allied Shinobi Forces of the Five Hidden Villages?

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.570
An allied force?

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.070
That is a fine plan. We are in an emergency state.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.230
Cooperation is crucial.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.230
It's going perfectly.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:04.670
Going forward, we must determine a chain of command.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.930
We must avoid any further confusion.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:14.370
So? Who will we choose to lead the allied forces?

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.770
Leaving that to you five will only result in arguments.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.230
So I ask that you respect the position of the neutral nations

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.700
and allow me to come up with a proposal

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:30.770
to decide who among you five Kage is most suitable.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.770
This spells the end of Tsunade's era.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.730
Presently, only Hidden Leaf Village has a Jinchuriki, the Nine-Tails.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.230
The key is how to utilize it.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.170
How about granting the supreme authority

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.600
of the Allied Shinobi Forces to the Hokage?

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.170
Why did it turn out like this?!

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.170
Don't cry, Ino!

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.870
Kiba, don't be so harsh.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.670
You know how Ino has felt about Sasuke all these...

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.030
It can't be helped!

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.370
Things have changed since then.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.300
Will they be okay?

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.430
Look at Ino. How will Naruto and Sakura take it?

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.930
Let's leave it to Shikamaru. He'll find the right words.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.470
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Painful Decision"

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.170
Wait, Shikamaru!

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.600
Tune in again!
