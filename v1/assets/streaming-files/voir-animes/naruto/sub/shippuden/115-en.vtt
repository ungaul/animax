WEBVTT

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.470
AUTOPSY ROOM 3 SHIZUNE OYONE KUMADORI

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.170
What is all this ruckus?!

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.770
The Akatsuki has begun its assault.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.370
Danzo...

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.830
Is it true about the Akatsuki attacking?!

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.400
Yes, the one who has attacked is Pain, their leader...

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.830
who defeated Jiraiya.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.930
You're saying that he has personally come after the Hidden Leaf,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.600
so soon after he killed Jiraiya?

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.270
Yes... They've been hunting Jinchuriki hosts

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.470
in order to accumulate Tailed Beasts.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.030
It's believed that in addition to the One-Tail of the Sand,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.800
most of the Jinchuriki have fallen into their hands.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.170
Then...their target is...

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.300
The Fourth Hokage's legacy... Naruto Uzumaki!

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.600
And yet, despite the danger,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.830
the Fifth Hokage is trying to summon Naruto back.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.500
Such a thing... is like pouring oil onto a fire!

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.330
Yes... If we keep listening to the Fifth Hokage...

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.470
the Hidden Leaf will be destroyed!

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.600
What was that?!

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.100
Stop! You mustn't go outside!

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.700
Shikamaru! What's going on?!

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.030
The Akatsuki has entered our territory.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.430
Kurenai Sensei, can you step back?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.130
Drop dead!

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.270
Get down!

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.630
Are you all right?

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.670
I'm fine. But Sensei, please use the underground tunnel

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.030
and go to the evacuation shelter.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.000
I'll escort you part way.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.930
If anything should happen to you or the baby,

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.370
I wouldn't be able to face Asuma.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.430
Shikamaru...

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.430
Huh? Where's Naruto?

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.770
Can't you tell?

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.800
Heh?

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.530
Look carefully!

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.430
Naruto... I didn't notice him at all.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.670
Impressive...

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.400
Look how far he's come in being one with nature.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.930
Well, that's about it for this training.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.300
I gotta take care of some business!

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.830
Watch out, Lord Fukasaku!

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.800
Oww... Are you all right, Lord Fukasaku?

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.070
Jiraiya-boy's eyes were not wrong.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.970
That boy will become even stronger than Jiraiya-boy!

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.830
Hey! Hurry and get off me! You're heavy!

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.900
Naruto...You idiot!

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.770
HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL Choji!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.430
I brought you pills.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.770
Thanks.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.770
What is...?!

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.730
Oh, the pain... My leg... What is all of this?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.700
Miss Sakura! You're just in time.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.930
Please take command.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.270
Huh? What about Master Shizune?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.070
She's not here.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.700
Oh, that's right. She's in the middle of the autopsy.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.670
There are so many wounded,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.670
even the Medical Ninja are in a state of confusion.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.430
We need someone to take charge and give us orders.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.100
Take charge?!

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.400
To be responsible for so many lives...

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.270
At a time like this, Lady Tsunade would...

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.600
Here. Why not eat this and just do your best?

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.200
This is for the wounded, not me!

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.270
If you're able to walk, please go to the evacuation shelter.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.130
Shortly, many more seriously wounded will arrive!

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.570
Those who are critical will be red!

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.830
If treatment can wait, they are yellow!

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.130
And those with minor injuries are green!

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.170
Tag them with ribbons and separate them!

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.300
Y-Yes, ma'am.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.270
You're...amazing.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.870
I'm going back! You're in charge here.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.970
Yes.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.000
Are you all right? Can you breathe?

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.170
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.260
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.680
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.600
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.400
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.700
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.910
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.540
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:27.170
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.170
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:34.340
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:42.560
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.060
koete Someday...

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.330
Power to Believe

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.700
All right. I will return to call Naruto back.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.370
I'm counting on you!

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.900
Stop!

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.970
Leave Naruto on Mount Myoboku.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.100
What?!

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.500
We understand that it's the Akatsuki's leader

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.070
who has attacked our village.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.770
How did you find out?

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.030
We heard it from Danzo.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.570
Moreover, they are after Naruto's Jinchuriki power.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.400
So what of it?

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.330
The last time, we gave you the benefit of the doubt.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.930
But not this time.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.530
Naruto is still a child.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.230
This is the assailant who brought Jiraiya down!

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.770
If Naruto is taken and the Nine-Tails falls into their hands...

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.630
Wha-?! What are you doing?!

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.070
Don't try to protect me! Naruto, you too, stop!

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.030
If you die...your dreams, everything will be gone.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.530
Humph... I'm all right.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.070
Enough! Move! And run!

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.930
Until I become Hokage...

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.700
I'll...

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.900
never die!

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.430
I will avenge Pervy Sage!

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.170
I can't just sit around doing nothing!

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.830
However...I guess I shouldn't wallow in sadness.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.770
My duty is to be a model for the next generation

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.400
and to help them out.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.700
For that, I'd happily give my life.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.930
I can see that child truly loved and admired Jiraiya-boy.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:49.000
I can't help but hope that he is the Child of Prophecy.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.130
For Jiraiya-boy has entrusted his all to that child.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.270
Y-You... Unhand us, Tsunade!

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.730
How dare you raise your hand against us counselors...

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.900
Who do you think you are?!

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.100
How long do you intend to treat him like a child?

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.470
What?!

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.600
The will of the Hidden Leaf has been passed on

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.770
and it's growing!

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.400
Naruto is striving to surpass Jiraiya this very minute!

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.100
He's not a hidden weapon

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.100
to be used by the Hidden Leaf as a deterrent to war!

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.370
He is a ninja who has sworn to protect the Hidden Leaf...

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.570
He is Naruto Uzumaki!

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.900
Jiraiya, Sarutobi Sensei and Lady Chiyo of the Sand

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.100
all had what you two lack.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.070
Do you know what that is?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.230
Today, I am going to recite a poem I wrote.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.430
I want you to remember it when you go home.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.270
No thanks! I can't memorize stuff like that.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.930
Couldn't agree more.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.400
Hey! Naruto!

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.400
Iruka Sensei!

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.700
That's all right, Iruka. They have a point.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.430
Ah... I-I'm sorry.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.870
Let's see. I won't tell you to memorize the entire poem.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.970
Nor will I expect you to understand its meaning.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.530
But when you are grown,

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.870
I want you to think back and recall the words of this old man.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.230
It's about a way of thinking

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.130
that is sure to be useful to you in your future,

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.700
and concerns the will of fire.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.400
In the place where leaves dance... The fire burns...

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.400
The shadow of the fire shines on the village...

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.370
Once again, new leaves sprout.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.470
Amidst this Shinobi world created by us foolish old people...

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.730
I am glad that a person like you showed up...

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:18.230
The things I did in the past were nothing but mistakes...

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.770
But...in my last hour,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.100
it seems I shall finally be able to do the right thing.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.070
The Village Hidden in the Sand and... The Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.830
The future is likely to be different

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.070
from the way things were in our time...

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.200
Your mysterious power that Kakashi spoke of...

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.400
That power is likely to alter the future greatly...

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.670
when you become a Hokage like none before...

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.970
What Sarutobi Sensei and Lady Chiyo of the Sand had,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.330
and what you two lack. That is...

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.330
The power to believe!

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.070
In the same way that my grandfather, the First Hokage,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.670
believed in you and entrusted the Hidden Leaf to you...

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.200
It is time for you to believe,

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.330
and entrust to the next generation!

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.930
Do as you please.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.930
Lady Tsunade!

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.470
Did you learn anything?

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.430
Yes!

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:39.500
This here!

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.330
What is it?

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.330
It seems to be a receiver for chakra signals.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.500
Pain's corpse had these inserted throughout his body.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:50.970
A receiver?!

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.630
According to what Lord Fukasaku said,

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:59.630
all six Pains had these stuck in their bodies and faces.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.200
Does this mean that the six Pains receive

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:07.430
some kind of chakra signal through their bodies, and then take action?

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.900
That part isn't clear yet.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.730
A receiver... Or they use it to transmit chakra to each other.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.200
Something wireless...

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.300
Also, this has definitely been activated.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.430
This must be connected to the secret of Pain's strength.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.300
Together with the data the Interrogation Corps gathers,

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.500
we'll figure this out.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.300
According to the Intel Division, the enemy is looking for Naruto.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.370
This enemy, who infiltrated the village, is undoubtedly Pain.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.200
Pain...

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.600
We must tell Lord Fukasaku of the situation in detail.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.530
Messenger frog! When you go to summon Naruto,

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.800
relay this message as well.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.100
Understood!

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.000
Shizune, take the data from the autopsy,

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.400
collaborate with Interrogation Corps and figure out just who Pain is!

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.170
Yes, ma'am!

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.270
Anbu Black Ops cell B will provide Shizune with a protective escort!

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.830
Subsequently, you are to guard the Interrogation Corps!

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.470
Do not allow the enemy to get near them!

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.270
Yes, ma'am!

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.070
I will wait for further news on the rooftop,

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.870
and I will provide treatment for all the wounded through Katsuyu.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.970
I will use all my power to protect the village!

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.130
Let's go!

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.830
Right! I must rush to Lord Fukasaku too!

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.470
They are so useless. All they've done is grow old...

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.170
So Tsunade persuaded them to her side instead...

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.730
But now, the Nine-Tails can be kept caged up.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.170
I'll ask you once more.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.900
Where is Naruto Uzumaki?

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.900
Go to hell!

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.870
Speak. Is Naruto Uzumaki in this village or not?

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.230
Which is it?

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.030
I-I don't know...

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.330
This guy... He sucked up the jutsu!

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.870
Then we'll have to engage in direct combat.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.300
Summoning Jutsu.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.070
Starting now, attach yourself to every ninja and citizen

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.830
in the Hidden Leaf Village!

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.670
Take in my chakra and use it to treat all their injuries!

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.630
It seems the village is in dire straits.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.300
Never mind, just go.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.000
I understand.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.730
I will protect this village, no matter what happens!

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.000
I swear upon my title of Hokage!

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.700
Are you all right?

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.030
Tell me where the Jinchuriki of the Nine-Tails is...

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.570
Or else, I'll kill you.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.800
This crest...

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.630
I see... So he's from the Akatsuki.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.100
Speak up.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:45.630
Naruto...

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.030
I have no intention of telling you anything!

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.530
I see... Then I have no use for you.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.170
You create a loud diversion,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.170
so that you can investigate from the shadows, eh?

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.430
Kakashi!

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.970
Please take the wounded one and get away.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.500
Leave this scene to me.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:16.770
Roger!

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.830
Good luck, Kakashi!

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.800
Now it's just the two of us.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.600
Then I'll ask you. Where is the Nine-Tails?

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.170
What you're doing is totally pointless.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.400
The people of this village are different from your average village.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.730
Even if it means dying,

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.370
there's not a single one of us who would

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.430
sell out a comrade.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.770
Pain displays his overwhelming powers

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.930
by wiping out the Leaf reinforcements.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:47.200
Despite their efforts, the Leaf Ninja are gradually cornered.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.330
Those who fight for the village...

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.700
And those who fight to protect their loved ones...

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.400
As they fight past their own limits,

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.570
what possible strategy can they make?

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.600
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Pain vs Kakashi"

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.700
Tune in again!
