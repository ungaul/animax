00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.970
Hey, what do you mean by "destroying the Leaf Village"?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.500
I mean today's Leaf Village!

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.030
Today's Leaf Village...?!

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.000
That means, Lady Tsunade will...!

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.470
- You're right... - What?

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.370
Your story doesn't add up.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.700
I know Sai's boss used to oppose Old Man Third Hokage,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.430
but why do they have to destroy the Leaf Village...

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.770
or do something to Grandma Tsunade?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
Did you forget, Naruto?

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.600
Lady Tsunade used to be a favorite pupil of the Third.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.600
Besides that, the current regime of the Leaf Village

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.200
was initiated by the Fifth Hokage, Lady Tsunade,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.200
and it obviously complies with the wishes of the Third.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.970
Undoubtedly Danzo is not happy about this...

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.470
but most of the people in the village support the current regime,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.600
so the regime can't be changed easily.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.670
The only way to change the regime is...

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.370
to cause an earth-shaking event in the village.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.330
An event like...

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.700
the "The Destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village" that Orochimaru set up.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.270
The destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village...!

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.530
Danzo may be thinking about conspiring with Orochimaru

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.530
and making him attack Leaf Village one more time...

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.530
in order to force Lady Tsunade from the position of Hokage...

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.730
So, you're saying they want to destroy Leaf Village...

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.700
- just because of that?! - It's not only because of that!

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.770
He wants to build his ideal village after destroying the regime...

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.270
and return to center stage as Hokage.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.670
The reason why Danzo went into action at this late date is...

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.800
...because he sees it's been three years since the last attack,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.870
so there has been enough time for Orochimaru...

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.070
to fully regain his forces.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.700
I think that's also part of it.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.470
Or he may have thought Orochimaru is more cautious now

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.270
because of the failure of the last attack.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.530
If he acts now, he thinks the negotiations with Orochimaru...

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.070
will get under way easily.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.870
That means he's going to propose cooperation from the village, right?

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.100
Yes...

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.070
Wait a minute... You mean Sai's secret mission is...

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.530
Perhaps...

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.230
The Consequences of Betrayal 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.130
You mean, Sai's top secret mission...

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.930
...is probably to earn Orochimaru's trust

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.000
and serve as a liaison between Danzo and Orochimaru.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.930
He thought the odds of him running into Orochimaru...

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.900
would be high if he was in our group.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.030
That can't be...!

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.630
If that's the case...

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.100
then we might have to get rid of Sai.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.700
Get rid of him?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.830
Lord Orochimaru.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.430
I know.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.130
It appears we're being followed.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.530
Is he simply following us, or is someone making him do that?

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.430
What should we do?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.670
One way or the other...

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.970
I'm afraid we're going to need a corpse.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.530
Right, Kabuto?

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.600
Get rid of...

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.930
...Sai?

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.100
No matter how you look at it, that's too hasty...

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.570
Now, my clone is following them,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.700
but there's no way of knowing what's gonna happen...

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.370
We're gonna get on their trail right away.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.970
- But... - Okay!

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.130
Let's go...!

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.600
What the...?

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.600
Naruto!

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.470
Naruto! Are you all right?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.570
He hasn't fully recovered yet from the damage he suffered earlier...

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.930
Captain Yamato...

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.430
Sakura, we better get going...

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.430
I know we should catch up right now. But...

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.470
But...with Naruto's condition being like this...

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.100
In that case, we'll leave him.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.570
Leave him? How could he say such a thing...?!

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.530
He should have enough strength left...

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.330
to get back to the village on his own.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.100
Kakashi Sensei would never talk that way...!

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.430
Sakura...

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:36.400
Sakura... I'll...be...all right...

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.800
I can make it...

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.970
Naruto!

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.730
Sakura, I know what you're trying to say.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.930
On top of that, I've teamed up with Kakashi in the Anbu Black Ops Unit before...

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.770
I also know the kind of person he is.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.900
It's true that I'm filling in for Kakashi.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.870
But, I'm not Kakashi.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.070
I'm sorry, but I just can't say,

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.800
"I won't let you get hurt," with a laugh.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.700
I won't let my comrades die.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.800
You're no longer apprentice Ninja in need of protection,

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.700
but Shinobi shouldering the future of the Leaf Village...

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.500
who will have to eventually surpass Kakashi.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.330
Compassion and co-dependence aren't the same thing!

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.730
If we give up now, it'll end in failure.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.600
If we don't follow now,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.730
we're never going to catch Orochimaru.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.700
There is no second chance with Orochimaru.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.700
Sakura...

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:39.930
Yeah.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.700
It's time to get moving now.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.130
Naruto, what are you going to do?

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.270
Of course...

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.830
I'm going!

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.730
Naruto!

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.670
I'm okay...

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.930
If I went back to the village now...

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.400
I wouldn't know why I came this far.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.030
Naruto...

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.800
Fine, but... if you slow us down,

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.630
we have to leave you behind, do you understand?

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.500
Okay!

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:47.600
Then, let's go!

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.670
That's!

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.530
You've sure done it... Orochimaru...

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.500
Naruto!

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.500
Sakura!

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.730
Sakura!

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:35.570
Sakura...

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.130
Are you all right, Sakura!

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.630
That wound is...

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.900
Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox must have entered...

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.600
through the wound like poison...

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.770
This can't easily be healed even with a skilled medical Ninjutsu.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.700
That's why...

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.800
That's why I'm even more surprised

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.070
that Naruto has been able to endure that Chakra.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.600
This...

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.530
This...was done by Orochimaru.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.370
Well, it hurts only a little, so... I'm okay.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.170
Don't push yourself too hard, Sakura.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600
I got it...

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.600
Let's take a little break.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.270
Sakura is our team's only Medical Ninja...

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.330
In other words, she is a key cog in the success of our mission.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.600
I'm all right. If we don't leave now...

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.700
even you said... I'm sorry...but I just can't say,

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.370
"I won't let you get hurt." with a laugh.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.600
You're no longer apprentice Ninja in need of protection,

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.130
but Shinobi shouldering the future of the Leaf Village...

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.930
who will have to eventually surpass Kakashi.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.670
Compassion and co-dependence aren't the same thing!

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.500
It's true what I said,

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.130
but they also say that "haste is from the devil."

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.230
I mean, there is a difference between hurrying and recklessness.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.370
I agree!

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.570
Captain Yamato is right!

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.970
You are the only Medical Ninja in our group

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.730
with monstrous strength...

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.270
So, you're the precious cog...

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.730
I told you that you don't need to add "monstrous strength"!

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.630
- What, what?! - Shut up!

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.830
I'm just complimenting your...

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.770
O-Okay, okay... I apologize!

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.630
Naruto!

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.300
Since Sai's out, you'll be my partner for the battle.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.330
Let's decide on our collaboration patterns while we have time.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.070
Can you come over here for a bit?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.330
Got it.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.470
They stopped the chase... I wonder if it went well...

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.200
Perhaps...

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.370
At any rate...

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.800
you did a fine job, as usual, Kabuto...

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:06.030
I've created countless dead bodies since I've been with you...

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.630
It might have been a little wasteful, though...

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.030
Even so, it's better to be cautious.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.430
Oh.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.930
I got a good idea, Lord Orochimaru.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.530
How about having him help out our experiments?

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.430
I think he'll have lots of free time...

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.130
besides serving as a liaison with Danzo...

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.400
Hmm... do as you please.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.070
A fake body, just as I thought...

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.230
Most likely this Jutsu was done by Kabuto...

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.770
Sure enough, this wound is slow to heal...

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.700
the best I can do is to ease the pain...

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.100
This is far enough...

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.000
We're gonna do it here?

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.370
Yes... But, first...!

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.870
One moment, my Wood Clone has just contacted me.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.800
Yes... That's right...

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.000
There's an unnatural and subtle stitching in the head...

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.970
He's done a perfect job, it's not noticeable at first glance.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.930
If we didn't prepare for this,

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.430
we would have been fooled completely...

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.370
Amazing that they've already discovered that we've been tailing them.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.470
I was confident, but...

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.730
we have to be even more cautious from now on...

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.330
Since we're dealing with Orochimaru...

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.830
we can't be too careful.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.130
Captain Yamato!

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.370
Ah yes, I'm done with my errand.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.870
All right! So, what are we gonna do first?

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:38.230
But before that... There's something I need to tell you.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.170
The one who hurt Sakura was...

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.730
you, Naruto.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.300
Hey Sakura, is that the picture book that belonged to Sai?

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.000
Yes, it is.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.430
I'm wondering what's in the book?

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:45.770
Don't ask me.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:49.230
Hmm, it seems there're no words or dialogue, though.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.670
Well, even if we see what's inside, I bet It's not good at all.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.400
I'm hoping this book gives some information leading to Sai...

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.500
Come to think of it, Sai cherishes this book, doesn't he?

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.470
He also said it's his older brother's book.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.370
Hey, don't you think the facing pages are a little creepy?

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:07.600
Next Time: "The Unfinished Page"
