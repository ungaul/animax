WEBVTT

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.830
Now for the main issue...

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.730
Now I'm going to determine the Buddy Teams.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.170
First, Sakura and I will be one team!

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.200
The other team will be... Naruto and Sai.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.830
Me...?

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.100
with him...?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.630
Captain Yamato and I will form one team.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.370
And...

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.170
the other team will be Naruto and Sai.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.430
Looking forward to it

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.100
There's that fake smile again.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.570
Damn it!

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.770
Captain Yamato.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.900
What is it, Naruto?

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.730
Why...Why do I have to team up with him ?

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.300
Is there a problem?

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.570
U-Understood.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.770
Good.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.230
I see...

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.530
It can't be helped...

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.170
For the time being, you keep Naruto under control.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.700
Yes...

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.500
Um...Captain Yamato.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.000
What is it?

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.330
I think Naruto and I would make a better team.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.930
We've been working together for a while

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.070
and we know each other quite well, so.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.030
Right-right. That's my Sakura.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.370
Sakura.
Yes?

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.870
You're the only Medical Ninja on this team.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.870
We can't let you get hurt,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.130
and that is why you'll be with me.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.900
You understand, right?

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.570
Yes, I do.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.100
As Sai said earlier,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.070
we can assume the enemy will be very skilled...

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.170
A mistake in teamwork could prove fatal.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.400
I'm sure you have all something to say about this,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.670
but just concentrate on the mission for now.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.870
Yes, sir.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.270
Got it...

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.100
We don't know where Orochimaru's hideout is.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.570
But the Akatsuki spy is probably on his way

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.300
to the Tenchi Bridge right about now.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.870
Tenchi Bridge

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.600
Simulation 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.730
Here he comes...

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.500
Aren't we ready yet...?

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.330
There he is!

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.560
Damn it, where's the signal?!

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.470
There's the signal.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.200
Hold it!

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.230
Now, Naruto.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.000
Let's go, Sai.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.800
Based on what we just talked about,

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.770
although I generally don't do this very often...

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.830
tomorrow we'll devote half a day to a team-play simulation.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.500
A simulation?

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.300
That's right.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.700
All I know about you guys is what I've read in your files.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.070
I want to get an idea

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.670
of your fighting styles, battle skills and Jutsu types...

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.670
with my own eyes.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.970
And the cooperation of the team should get smoother

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.170
if we learn about each other.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.800
Uh-huh, cooperation, eh?

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.600
You might think I'm being too cautious...

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.270
But this is how I do things.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.470
You will  go along with it.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.730
Damn it!

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.070
Come at me for real!

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.930
Not nearly good enough.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.130
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.730
No way am I letting go!

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.730
Wha--?!

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.270
Why are you grabbing me, too?!

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.670
Hey, Sai! Do something about this!

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.570
That way, huh?

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.700
H-Hey! Where are you going, Sai?!

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.200
I've already captured Captain Yamato, so hurry up and untie me!

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:37.870
Naruto!

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.070
What're you doing?! That isn't Captain Yamato.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.000
Huh? What?

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.970
What the hell is this?!

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.370
Damn it! Hey, Sai!

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.170
Hurry up and untie this snake!

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.370
You did well to capture me, Sai.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.670
I see... He's more skilled than I imagined.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.100
I can't believe a Shinobi this good

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.100
was assigned to Team Kakashi as an alternate.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.070
An additional member...

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.070
a new recruit from the Anbu Black Ops Training Division

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.000
will be dispatched to Team Kakashi...

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.830
From...the Foundation ...?

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.070
However...

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:38.570
What is it...?

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.530
Keep a close watch on his actions...

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.030
Lady Tsunade's concerns may not have been groundless.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.030
Hey, hey, hey!

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.470
You creep, Sai!

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.330
I see.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.200
She has incredible strength to be able to tear that snake...

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.870
I don't want to get hit by her again.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.700
Release.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.870
All right, that's the end of the simulation.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.370
You jerk!

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.430
What is it?

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.830
Don't you know what the word "comrade" is?

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.800
Listen, you!

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.600
I'm asking you if you know what the word "comrade" is!

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.900
Of course I do...

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:50.870
(Comrade) What of it?

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.670
That's not what I'm trying to say.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.700
H-Hey, Naruto.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.770
Please don't blame your lack of individual competence on others.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.000
What did you say?!

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.430
Damn it!

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.730
Come at me for real!

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.400
If you hadn't let the Captain get a rise out of you ...

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.430
I could've remained hidden without being exposed.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.770
And it wouldn't have been this much trouble

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.770
to capture the Captain.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.970
What do you mean?

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.830
Even if you go to the trouble of transforming into me...

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.600
you'll be exposed as a Shadow Clone immediately

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.630
if you use one of your Jutsu.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.570
Because of that, the Captain saw through our strategy

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.000
and escaped into the forest using a Substitution.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.000
Then why didn't you break the Jutsu right away

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.530
if you knew it was a Substitution?

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.630
It isn't ideal to fight

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.570
while protecting someone who has lost his cool.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.830
All I did was consider the best way

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.500
to successfully complete the mission, make a judgment and take action.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.230
I won't acknowledge you.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.470
I'll never acknowledge the likes of you

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.000
as a comrade or as a member of Team Kakashi!

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.270
I guess these two just won't work as a team, huh?

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.630
I wonder what Sasuke would've done.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.070
Would he have fought while protecting you?

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.630
He's a Team Kakashi comrade to you, right?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.730
No good...

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.500
Naruto won't be able to put up with this any longer.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.170
If you call someone who betrayed his village and hurt you...

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.730
a comrade, that is.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.600
Naruto.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.300
This is not good.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.330
If it's to save that comrade,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.830
then I'll do whatever it takes.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.800
I'll even team up with you.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.730
Naruto.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.730
Why does he feel so strongly about Sasuke?

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:16.670
It's because Naruto... thinks of Sasuke like a brother.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.200
You've got a brother, too, don't you...?

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.370
You should understand a little about how he feels.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.570
No, not at all.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.400
I told you about titles for my drawings, right?

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.130
To be exact,

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.870
I couldn't title one of my drawings even if I wanted to...

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:49.430
Nothing comes to mind. I don't...feel anything.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.400
I have no such thing as emotions.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.270
What do you mean...

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.300
you don't feel anything or have any emotions...?

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.800
I mean just what I said.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.570
Even so, if you have a brother,

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.670
you should be able to imagine what it would be like to lose him, right?

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.630
Hm...? Yeah, well... you could say that.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.330
My brother's dead, after all.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.230
Then all the more...

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.470
I wonder if I should've looked like that.

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.200
What're you trying to say?

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:23.570
Well, I didn't know what kind of look to make when my brother died...

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.430
Look to make?

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:29.900
This guy...

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.830
That's enough talking.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.500
We're moving out pretty soon, so gather your things.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.730
Sai, normally I would've pounded you good back there...

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:54.730
I told you I wouldn't hold back if you spoke ill of Sasuke again, right?

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.500
But I didn't do that

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.030
because even though you insult Sasuke,

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:10.070
Naruto said he would team up with you if it meant saving Sasuke.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.370
No matter what kind of guy you are...

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.200
I must not hurt you if it means saving Sasuke.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.030
Sakura, in regards to Naruto...

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.370
Yeah, I guess I'd say you're nice to him.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.170
I once read something like this in a book.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.630
I don't know why such feelings arise.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.500
Guys.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.330
Let's get a move on.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.670
This will all come to nothing

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.570
if we don't get there by tomorrow afternoon.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.770
We're almost there.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.470
We'll head for the bridge once we're finished getting ready here.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.400
Tenchi Bridge

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.000
Damn it. That spy jerk isn't here yet?!

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.700
It won't be that easy. Our opponent is highly skilled.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.900
Being overly cautious is just fine.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.430
But if we're too cautious,

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.030
we might attract the spy's suspicion

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.530
and our timing to capture him will get thrown off.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:54.470
That's true.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.730
Shh! It looks like he's here.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.500
Took him long enough. Hey, th-that's...!

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.930
No way! It can't be!

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.770
He's the Akatsuki spy?!

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.270
Next episode: "The Tenchi Bridge."
