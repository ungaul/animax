WEBVTT

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.030
Guy Sensei!

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.160
That was Guy's final move!

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.910
What happened?

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.700
I almost died, you bastard!

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.830
Your flame is about to go out.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.030
But in gratitude for such a great time,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.950
I'll finish you off before you turn to ash on your own!

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.530
He kicked away my Truthseeker Orb?!

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.280
Bushier Brow Sensei…

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.700
Naruto…

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.490
You seem a little different from before.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.660
What did Obito do?

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.200
Yeah…

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.370
I'm still trying to figure it out myself.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.450
But I think I can change everything now!

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.900
To Rise Up

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.150
That node's chakra hasn't gone out.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.400
What's going on? What did he do?

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.610
Don't tell me he stopped the end result of the Eight Gates?!

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.610
He touched the Truthseeker Orb, so how can he—?

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.320
Is it because I haven't finished healing yet?

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.450
No!

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.360
His power is suddenly growing?!

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.740
Son!

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.900
Lend me some of your chakra, okay?

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.740
All right!

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.360
Sage Art: Lava Style Rasen Shuriken!

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.740
Th-This is bad!

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.070
Limbo!

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.490
What?! He dodged…my Limbo?!

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.610
All right!

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.740
Burst!

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.650
The tree's been severed!

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.450
Take me within you.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.360
Who is that?!

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.150
Take the Divine Tree…

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.070
Ten Tails…

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.450
…everything, into you.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.860
Did Naruto do it?

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.740
Guy Sensei is over there too!

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.150
The tree disappeared!

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.990
Guy Sensei!

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.200
Bushier Brow Sensei is gonna be okay!

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.650
He's not gonna die!

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.950
Naruto, you healed him?

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.320
But I thought he had activated all Eight Gates…

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.400
I feel like I can do all sorts of things…

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.240
the way I am right now!

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.570
He touched Madara's rods, but he wasn't affected…

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.530
What happened to him while he was dying?

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.450
Can you teleport, Lord Second?

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.070
I see…

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.820
Yeah… Since I'm linked to the Fourth's markings.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.780
But unfortunately…

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.780
At my current strength, I can only teleport one person.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.780
That's plenty.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.610
I alone need to go.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.110
Sasuke!

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.400
His wind… has gotten even stronger.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.610
Sasuke… I wanted to see where your wind would take you…

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.610
But I've witnessed enough.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:30.030
In fact, from now on, we'll only be a burden to you.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.110
So we're not gonna be ordered around anymore.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.200
That sounds good to me too.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.450
Sasuke…

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.740
Hey…

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.860
Why are you trying to give up, guys?

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.700
I… I…

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.780
Bushy Brow and Gaara, take care of Bushier Brow Sensei.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:10.860
Naruto…

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.070
Thank you for…Guy Sensei…

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.780
Naruto…

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.740
When you become Hokage, let's have a drink together.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.700
You got it!

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.740
Is that Naruto?!

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.030
Obito…

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:43.780
You…

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:51.780
You're an enemy.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.490
You hurt and killed many of my comrades…

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.650
I don't want to say this, but…

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.780
I'm going to consider you an ally just this once.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.860
Thank you for saving Naruto.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.530
I have one final favor to ask you.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.610
Not as an ally, but as an enemy…

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.570
I understand now…

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.610
The Divine Tree itself…

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.490
The time has come for all to become one.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.650
Is it because I met Super Gramps Sage

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.570
and got more power from him?

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.610
I can feel it clearly even from here…

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.780
The other half of Super Gramps' power.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.610
You cannot take me down.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.570
Essentially, I am completely immortal now.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.610
I have obtained eternity!

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.780
You idiot!

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.900
I'm not taking you down…

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.700
We're gonna take you down!

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.360
Your time has come, Madara.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.360
One has awakened the Six Paths' Senjutsu…

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.570
and the other awakened the Rinnegan, huh?

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:37.860
However…I possess both of those powers!

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.240
This is the final battle!

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.740
My powers versus yours…

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.150
Let's settle who is superior, once and for all!

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.950
Sage Art: Shadow Style Thunder Blast!

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.070
Sasuke's gone?!

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.280
This left eye… So that's what it can do…

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.740
Teleportation? This distance?

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.900
No, he didn't teleport!

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.280
You should pay attention!

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.740
Limbo!

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:47.900
What is that?!

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.280
He did it again!

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.950
Sage Art!

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.110
Gale Style: Fang of Light!

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.240
It's coming again!

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.610
Over there!

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.030
It didn't hit.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.740
Sasuke, it's headed your way!

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.450
Something I can't see is ambling around you.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.030
Oh yeah? I can see it clearly!

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.860
These guys can see my Limbo…

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.990
It's…another Madara.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.450
So he can see it with his Rinnegan…

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.150
And that one, can't see it but senses it…

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:48.700
Naruto!

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.820
Looks like our physical attacks…

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.150
have no effect on the other Madara.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:56.610
Yeah!

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.740
Normally, one shouldn't be able to sense or see it from this realm…

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.320
That "me" exists in the invisible world of "Limbo."

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.240
How did they both obtain such power so suddenly?

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.650
That Sasuke Uchiha…

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.650
He was the only one who awakened the straight pattern,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.700
Choku-Tomoe Sharingan just like mine.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.400
Perhaps Sasuke and I share a bond that goes beyond blood.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.700
Well then… That left eye should suit me perfectly!

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.740
So, that's your left eye's ability as well.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.360
Then try it.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.400
That's not enough to kill you, is it?

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.610
So the Six Paths' Sage Chakra can affect

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.450
the shadow Madara too, huh?

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.150
That wound on his right arm…

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.740
is from blocking Naruto's first attack earlier.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.030
It seems your shadow returns to your body

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.030
after a certain amount of time.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:44.530
Naruto, when his shadow emerges again, go after it.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.650
I'll take on the visible one. However…

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.570
I used to hate it when you would order me around…

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.530
Some things never change, huh?

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.740
Let me finish.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.110
This is our chance.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.990
Madara and his shadow will probably stay merged

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.740
for a little while longer.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.700
I don't care what it is,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.650
but get a Sage Power Jutsu ready.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.820
One that seals movement.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:18.490
Then you should use my chakra to build your Sealing Jutsu.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.610
Thanks…ummm… It's Shukaku!

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.650
He's estimating the Limbo's duration,

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.570
activation interval and how to counter it…

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.740
He's got a sharp intuition,

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.650
calm analyzing and judgment skills,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.700
and a Choku-Tomoe Sharingan just like mine.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.780
If he had only been born before Obito… he would be my…

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.700
No… There's no point in reflecting now.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.490
No matter what's happened,

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.400
I must keep in mind that these two aren't ordinary brats.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.700
I need to get my other eye back soon.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.240
Sage Art: Magnet Style Rasengan!

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.360
And I have Six Paths Power too…

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.240
Chidori!

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.900
Naruto, shoot that towards me!

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.530
I'll take care of the rest.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.030
It's a bit irritating, but there's no time to argue!

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.900
Why am I here?

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.900
Naruto, the jutsu the Sage of Six Paths gave you…

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.320
You know it, right?

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.610
Yeah, the time is now!

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:58.610
What?

00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.740
He moved?

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.400
He substituted his shadow?

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.030
Over there!

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.280
Sasuke, I'll hold this one down, so go after the real one!

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.820
Seems like his Rinnegan can't reach this distance.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.200
I'm starting to understand your left eye's abilities, Sasuke.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.610
Hurry, Sasuke!

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.900
Madara is heading straight for…

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.030
Kakashi Sensei!

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.320
Hurry and destroy my Rinnegan…

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.200
I can't hold off Black Zetsu any longer.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.070
I must admit Sasuke sure is fast.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.570
Kamui!

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.360
Damn!

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.070
Just his upper body, huh?

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:45.820
Hurry!

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.070
I know!

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.780
Oh no, you don't!

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.320
The Rinnegan will fall into Madara's hands.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.280
If he ends up with both eyes, terrible things will happen.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.110
Terrible things? How much worse can it get?

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.950
If both Rinnegan are restored to their true owner…

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.400
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Infinite Dream"

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.700
…I fear no one will be able to stand against him.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:18.150
THE INFINITE DREAM Tune in again!
