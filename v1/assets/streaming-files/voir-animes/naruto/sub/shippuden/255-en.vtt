WEBVTT

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.670
The younger brother, Ashura, has been reincarnated in you.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.750
My eyes can clearly see Ashura's chakra clinging about you.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.880
I wonder if…

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.170
You don't seem too surprised.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.170
Perhaps, you have sensed Ashura's presence

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.750
inside you already?

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.880
I thought as much. Then you must know already…

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.250
who is the reincarnate of the older one, Indra…

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.830
Sasuke…

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.630
Sasuke did that?

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.000
Yes, it's an unbelievable situation.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.540
That's why I want you to let me handle Sasuke.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.330
You want to take on Sasuke alone?

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.790
How can you expect us to agree to that?

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.420
Tenten is right, Naruto.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830
We can't just give in to your stubbornness.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.710
The reason is… this is a big problem for the village.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.830
I'm not being stubborn.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.290
You said you'd give us the details when we got home,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.250
but I never thought this is what you'd say!

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.040
We've all made up our minds to kill Sasuke!

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.790
Hey, Naruto, I hope you're not saying you'll get Sasuke all by yourself,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.080
when you're actually planning to protect him.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.710
No, I have no intention of protecting Sasuke.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.880
After all the fighting at the Five Kage Summit,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.460
and fighting Danzo…

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.420
If Sasuke was so weakened at that time,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.630
why didn't you take him out right then?

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.580
Madara was there too!

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.040
It didn't seem like it would be an easy task. Besides…

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.830
That's no reason to let him get away so easily!

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.040
Hey, Naruto… You're strong.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.000
You're the hero who took down Pain, aren't you?!

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.330
Hero?

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.750
Yeah. You could take Sasuke down like you did back then.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.330
That's not true.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.130
I wouldn't be able to beat Sasuke with something like that now.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.920
That's what I found out.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.500
Inside him too, is…

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.420
Isn't that right?

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.080
The Sage of Six Paths

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.330
The older brother, Indra, has been reincarnated in you.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.960
My eyes can clearly see Indra's chakra clinging about you.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.710
You don't seem too surprised.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.830
Perhaps, you have sensed Indra's presence inside you already?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.500
I thought as much. Then you must know already…

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.960
who is the reincarnate of the younger one, Ashura…

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.750
Naruto…

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.170
Isn't that right?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.920
Yes. You sensed it, after all.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.290
It seems that there were other reincarnates

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.710
besides Sasuke and me… Who were the others?

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.830
The first generation of reincarnates were Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.210
Hashirama was Ashura. Madara was Indra.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.250
You know how they ended up.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.170
However, before Madara could end his life as a reincarnate,

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.170
he created a certain problem.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.040
Madara was so obsessed with power that he stole some of Hashirama's.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.040
Which, in short, caused the merging

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.290
of a portion of Ashura's chakra with Indra's chakra…

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.580
And the result was that it became essentially, my own chakra.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.880
That's right, he awakened the Rinnegan.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.500
I always thought that someone like that would appear

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.170
among either Indra or his reincarnates.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.710
Hence, I left behind the stone tablet

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.750
that contained my writings on how to deal with this.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.880
Although, it seems no one could understand its meaning…

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.460
So, Super Sage Gramps, you've been watching

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.960
your kids' sibling rivalry all this time?

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.580
Yes, I suppose you could say that.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.040
I see… Through Ninshu,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.170
I preached that chakra is the power that links individuals.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.790
I strongly believe that chakra should not be something

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.880
that amplifies the strength of one person alone.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.670
Even after my mother, Kaguya, put an end to chaotic times,

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.170
she ruled with her power alone.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.920
However, my mother's power bred arrogance within her.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.920
And mankind began to dread the existence of that power.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.290
That is why my mother, once known as the Rabbit Goddess,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.210
became feared as a demon.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.790
When power is concentrated in one person,

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.920
that power runs rampant and in time, it possesses the person.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.630
The current Madara is a prime example of that…

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.080
He's become just like my mother, Kaguya.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.460
Now, he's no longer Indra's incarnate.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.380
He's obtained Ten Tails' power and is getting close to me.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.330
And he is trying to obtain even my mother Kaguya's power.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.790
The Infinite Tsukuyomi doesn't just cast genjutsu over you.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.210
It keeps you trapped inside genjutsu dreams,

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.790
so that the caster can use your individual power while keeping you alive.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.830
You're attached to the roots of the Divine Tree,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.790
and turned into living slaves.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.790
Mother possessed the power of Sharingan as well as Byakugan.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.170
She used her Visual Prowess to cast that jutsu upon the populace.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.830
It was a ghastly jutsu.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.000
If all chakra were to be reunited into one again,

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.960
a new Chakra Fruit would take shape.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.630
That must be prevented at all costs…

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.630
or this world will end.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.790
I would like you to stop Madara.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.750
Unlike the previous reincarnates, you tend to be a little bit of a fool.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.880
But there may be potential in your unpredictability.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.790
Even long after you died, you tried to protect the world…

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.670
And even when it's turned out like this,

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.630
you still have faith in us. Thank you.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.290
Don't thank me. I don't deserve it.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:48.130
If the current world desires Indra's, or rather, my mother's way…

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.830
and if that's the natural flow…

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.210
then I'm the one who's selfishly trying to go against it and stop it.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.830
Even in terms of how the Tailed Beasts are being used,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.790
not for maintaining peace and balance, but only as weapons…

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.210
Perhaps my way is naïve.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.750
No!

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.040
You're not wrong, Super Gramps!

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.750
You're absolutely right, old man!

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.830
Oh, aren't you Gaara's?

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.830
Why are you inside of me?

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.290
You see, Obito…

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:25.830
Octopops!

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.250
He extracted a portion of Shukaku's and my chakra from Madara.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:36.210
He knew exactly which Tailed Beast powers you were lacking, that guy!

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.670
Obito did that?

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.290
A lot of things happened.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.170
He even put me inside of you.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.880
Now you've got the chakra of all nine Tailed Beasts within you, Naruto!

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.670
Even you? The other half of Kurama?

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.290
The promised time has finally come, old man Six Paths!

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.630
You're right, my dear Kurama…

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.750
Just as Gamamaru prophesied…

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.630
a blue-eyed youth who can name all nine beasts and frolic among them.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.330
Prophesied? You mean the prophecy Giant Gramps Sage passed on

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.790
to the Pervy Sage?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.170
Gamamaru is his real name?

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.750
You're pretty awesome because you know that, Super Gramps!

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.630
Hey, Naruto!

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.630
You truly have the ability to win other's cooperation.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.420
You managed to summon my soul.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.960
And accepted that Ashura has reincarnated inside of you.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.880
Shukaku.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.130
Matatabi.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.210
Isobu.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.790
Son Goku.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.920
Kokuo.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.130
Saiken.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.500
Chomei.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.750
Gyuki.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.960
Kurama.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.420
It seems the time has come…

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.790
for the child of prophecy to change the world.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.290
My dear Naruto…

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.170
What do you want to do?

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.420
What do you seek for the aftermath of this war?

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.000
I would like to hear your honest thoughts and opinions.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.920
Maybe I'm really like this Ashura guy.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.420
Only…unlike him, I'm just a stupid kid

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.710
who doesn't know much about a lot of things.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.000
But, I do know what friends are.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.250
And I want to protect them all.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:31.880
That's it.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.290
Is that your answer?

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:42.500
Yeah… Long ago, I entrusted everything to Ashura and

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.920
cast my attention away from Indra.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.130
That proved to be the source of calamity.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.830
Put out your dominant arm.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:01.040
This time, I am also entrusting my power to you, Indra's reincarnate.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.330
From this point on, Naruto and Sasuke…

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.750
What you both shall do, and what shall transpire,

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.630
will be up to the two of you.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.580
Naruto and I…

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.880
Sasuke and I… …may not be real brothers,

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.830
but I really believe that we can make peace.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.920
Because we're pretty good friends.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.330
Now then…

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.290
Hey, Kabuto!

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.040
Sasuke's… Sasuke's going to be okay, right?

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.540
Hey, say something, you—!

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.790
Obito!

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.380
Is Naruto all right?

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.500
Naruto the Jinchuriki will die if his Tailed Beast is extracted…

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.960
But I put the Tailed Beast back inside him.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.750
He should be okay now.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.290
Sasuke!

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.210
Naruto!

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.290
– Time to go. – Time to go.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.290
You're the first since Hashirama to make me feel this excited!

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.330
Can you still dance?

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.290
Do you have any other techniques?

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.710
Give me some more fun!

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.500
This guy…even after a barrage of Sekizo…!

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.670
Guy Sensei!

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.750
Even that…didn't work…

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.790
Sekizo…isn't enough!

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.380
This is great!

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.790
Keep on dancing!

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.080
All that's left…is Night Guy!

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.790
Given the state of his heart's Chakra Point,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.130
this will be his final attack…

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.210
Charge!

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.880
That stance is not the Sekizo!

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.170
Don't tell me he has something even greater!

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.960
Guy!

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.170
Come on, Dad, hurry!

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.750
There's no need to rush.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.750
The Academy isn't going to run away, is it?

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.830
There's a set time for entrance applications.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.880
Oh, nice to meet you!

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.330
My son will be attending the Academy.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:01.710
Dad…

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.880
I hope those two will get along okay.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.630
I'm afraid that will be impossible!

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.250
Huh? What a thing to say!

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.880
Are you one of those monster parents?!

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.920
No, Dad… You're wrong.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.250
He failed the Academy entrance exam.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.750
Oh, pardon me! I just assumed since you were in front of the Academy.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.580
Don't worry about it!

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.540
Uh, I don't think it's anything to be laughing about.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.630
Hey, Kakashi, don't be rude.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.920
But Dad, you were a lot ruder just a minute ago.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.170
I mean, this guy is trying to get in to the Academy

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.880
even though he can't use ninjutsu.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.130
Oops, we should get going, or we're going to be late.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.290
Right.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.830
Excuse me.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.290
Your name's Kakashi Hatake, right?

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.380
Thank you for your support!

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.000
Kakashi…

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.500
Don't slack off just because you got into the Academy.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.210
At the rate he's training,

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.920
that boy will become stronger than you.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.830
He will?

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.500
They haven't announced the alternates yet, have they?

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.540
The Academy isn't dumb.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.830
You should ask what his name is and remember it.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.500
What…?

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.750
He'll be a good rival for you.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.250
Hey, you!

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.630
What's your name?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.580
Might Guy!

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.130
I'm going to become stronger than anyone around!

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.000
You actually had perfect timing for once…

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.080
Are you all right, Kakashi?!

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.290
Dad, it ended up exactly as you predicted.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.080
Guy!

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.880
I'll acknowledge this chakra of yours!

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.040
Of all those who have fought me over the years,

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.880
there's no one who surpasses you at taijutsu!

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.040
I, Madara, declare you the strongest!

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.420
Flow!

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.580
He's fast!

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.920
What?! He's bending space?

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.040
Night Guy!

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.750
Guy Sensei?

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.000
That was Guy's final move!

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.880
What happened?

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.130
I almost died, you bastard!

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.830
Your flame is about to go out…

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.460
But in gratitude for such a great time,

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.580
I'll finish you off…

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.210
before you turn to ash on your own!

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.920
He kicked away my Truthseeker Orb?!

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.630
Bushier Brow Sensei…

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.380
Naruto…?

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.920
You seem a little different from before.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.330
What did Obito do?

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.830
Yeah…

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.790
I'm still trying to figure it out myself.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.960
But I think I can change everything now!

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.250
I know I just came back, but the next episode's an extra!

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.080
It's been three years since I was back in the village,

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.710
and Konohamaru's pestering me to teach him a new jutsu!

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.250
I guess I have no choice!

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:54.040
Well, I'll just have to teach him one amazing jutsu!

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.120
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Ones Who Will Inherit"

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.040
Konohamaru, just GAAH it and BAM it!

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:08.620
THE ONES WHO WILL INHERIT Tune in again!
