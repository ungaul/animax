00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.670
Sakura!

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.100
Granny Chiyo!

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.870
Are you okay?

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.170
Can you still move?

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.000
Oh? You're worrying about other people even with this wound?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.270
Sasori... How...?

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.430
Don't tell me...

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.000
So that's it.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.600
If you're a Medical Ninja,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.170
you should understand the situation you're in.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.030
Shut up!

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.670
You're a courageous girl.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.070
But how long can you hold on?

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.800
She's...stopping the bleeding

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.330
and healing herself with a sword stuck in her.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.270
She's skilled.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.270
Granny Chiyo, I'm okay.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.100
So hurry up and take the antidote.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.470
Sakura.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.700
It looks like the poison is starting to take effect.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.000
Of course, this sword is also poisoned, you see.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.470
My body's getting numb from the poison,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.100
so I can't control my Chakra very well.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.900
Impossible Dream 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.430
So that's the antidote.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.800
Why?

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.300
Granny...Chiyo.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.430
I can't believe how everyone chooses death for the sake of others...

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.500
How stupid...

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.370
I won't let go.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.000
This girl's got...incredible strength.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.830
Granny Chiyo!

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.630
It's futile to have a strength contest with her, huh?

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.070
Then...

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.770
Die!

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.070
Wh-What?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.970
You lowered your guard at the end, Sasori.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.700
What?

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.000
Now you can't move.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.470
Am I right?

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.000
Although you may have the body of a puppet,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.370
you use Chakra, so you need a part that's living...

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.170
That's your weakness.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.500
And just that part from your left chest

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.370
is missing from that shell.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.300
Here!

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.500
It was probably right before the Jutsu was completed.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.130
You switched... to a different puppet.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.800
The body of a puppet is basically just a doll.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.970
Your real body...

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.400
is that chest part that produces Chakra.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.630
Sakura!

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.100
This is not good.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.330
In any event, I've got to pull out this sword

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.000
while closing the wound.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.030
Hang in there.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.730
Just a little more.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.170
It's futile. I pierced a vital point.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.200
She'll soon be dead even without poison.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.770
She's lost too much blood.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.370
Since you're also a Medical Ninja,

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.230
I aimed for a spot you can't easily heal.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:21.030
I've already finished first-aid treatment with Medical Ninjutsu.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.770
What I'm doing right now isn't Medical Ninjutsu.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.430
What?

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:35.700
I'm giving her my own life energy.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.570
Don't tell me...

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.930
It's a Reanimation Ninjutsu!

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.800
A Reanimation Ninjutsu.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:08.170
It's a Jutsu I spent years creating originally for you...

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.170
one that only I can use.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.330
With this Jutsu...

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.500
life can even be breathed into puppets.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.630
In exchange for the life of the caster that is...

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.370
Sasori.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:58.430
But in hindsight, it's a dream that won't be realized...

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.430
How stupid...

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.470
Have a safe trip.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.770
It...It can't be...!

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:47.270
Damn you... White Fang of the Leaf!

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.400
Grandma Chiyo!

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.700
Are Mom and Dad back?

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.030
They're not?

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:28.400
W-Well, your mom and dad were suddenly sent on another mission...

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.700
It looks like they won't be back for a little while.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.200
I just heard from them

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.430
and they want you to wait with me for them to return.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.970
Can you wait, Sasori?

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.100
Yeah.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.000
How stupid.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.970
When did you grow senile, Grandma?

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.270
Sakura, are you okay?

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.770
Yes.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.030
What about you, Granny Chiyo?

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.970
That's strange.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.130
I thought the caster of that Reanimation Ninjutsu or whatever

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.430
was supposed to die

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.430
in exchange for breathing life into someone dead.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.830
Sakura's wound was severe, but she wasn't dead...

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.470
So I got off without serious injury.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.230
That's unfortunate.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.470
I'd stop that.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.570
This body doesn't even feel pain.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.700
The more you hit me, the greater the pain in your fist.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.030
Women sure like to do stuff that's pointless.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.930
I won't feel anything

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.600
even if my blood-related grandmother should die.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.000
My heart is just like this body.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.870
Up until now I've killed hundreds, thousands of people.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.930
She'd be the same as one of them.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.230
Things are simpler that way.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.030
Just what do you think a person's life is to you?!

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.630
What do you think a relative is to you?!

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.770
Come on... Is that what a Shinobi should be saying?

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:43.930
Why?

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.330
Why can you only think like that...?

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.170
Sakura...

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.430
That's enough.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:53.900
But...!

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.270
It was the evil customs and teachings of Hidden Sand Village.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.430
that made him what he is.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.370
Granny Chiyo.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.600
Do you want to have a body like this?

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.200
If you did,

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.470
you'd probably somewhat understand what I'm talking about.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.200
This body won't decay and it's not bound to a span of life.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.100
A puppet can be recreated over and over again.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.600
I can create as many people as I want with puppets.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.230
If  you want, that is...

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.170
It's not just about increasing the amount.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.370
A collection is all about quality.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.770
What the hell are you?!

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.900
I'd venture to say

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.930
I'm a human who couldn't completely become...a puppet.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.670
I'm a puppet,

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.070
but an incomplete puppet possessing a living core.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.100
I'm not a person... nor am I a puppet.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.870
I'll soon stop moving.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.370
Before that, I think I'll do something pointless...

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.730
It's your reward for defeating me.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:24.370
You wanted to know about Orochimaru, right?

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.530
At midday in ten days,

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.870
go to the Tenchi Bridge located in the Village Hidden in the Grass!

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.830
What do you mean?

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.900
I've got a spy working...

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.100
as one of Orochimaru's subordinates...

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:48.300
I was supposed to rendezvous... with him...there...

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.330
It's over, Granny Chiyo.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:51.530
Excellent work.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:03.170
No. I was the one who should've... been defeated.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:04.770
What?

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.530
Sasori read my final attack.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.170
But for some reason, he didn't dodge it.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.430
A slight opening was revealed.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.600
Could it be that he...?

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.500
Kakashi Sensei, aren't you ready yet?

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.870
It's about ready now.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.170
That's the thing you were talking about before?

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.770
That's right. It's my new Sharingan.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.130
Let's go, Naruto!

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.400
Right!

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.470
The more we fight, the stronger they get!

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.900
It looks like we have no choice,

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.770
but turn on our Reverse Mode!

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.530
Reverse Mode?
Allow me to explain!

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.330
We, Team Guy, only under an ultimately critical situation,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.630
can fully activate for a single time,

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.670
the Powerful Youth Burning Young Power stored within our mind and body,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.500
using it to increase our concentration and kiai,

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.700
and for a flash of a second, attain an explosively destructive power!

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.000
All right! Lee, now is our time to do this!

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.100
Yes! Guy Sensei!

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.030
Now just hold on for a second!

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.770
There is no such thing!

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.200
Next time: "Beasts: Alive Again!"
