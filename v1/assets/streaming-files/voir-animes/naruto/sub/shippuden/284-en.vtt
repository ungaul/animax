00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.820
Naruto Shippuden, Sasuke's Story: Sunrise, Part 2: Coliseum

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.950
"Encountered Exploding Humans."

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.280
"Will investigate independently. Please approve."

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.820
Just how long will your journey continue?

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.450
Sasuke, where are you going?

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.030
You're Sasuke Uchiha, right?

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.240
The lone survivor of the exalted Uchiha Clan.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.740
I knew it the moment I saw your Sharingan last night.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.620
Where are you going now?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.240
That has nothing to do with you.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.030
It does involve us!

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.620
Amino… …made us yummy meals.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.700
She was kind.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.700
You're going to look for that Fuushin guy, right?

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.700
But isn't he the one who changed Amino and the others

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.070
into the human something or other, right?

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.780
We're going with you.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.200
I think we may be able to help.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.320
And don't give us that look that says "I don't need you guys!"

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.780
That will only make us more determined!

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.200
Sasuke dear, are you listening?!

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.660
I don't care what you do. Just stop calling me that.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.070
I figure I'm older than you, Sasuke dear.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.320
So I can call you "dear."

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.320
Older? You?

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.160
Ahem!

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.870
By that much?

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.410
What do you mean by "that much"?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.030
Sasuke dear, it's not good to judge people by their looks

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.370
or by your impression of them.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.200
You shouldn't judge people

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.620
by their looks or by your impression of them.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.030
HIDDEN LEAF POLICE FORCE Are you going to join too, Big Brother?

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.160
HIDDEN LEAF POLICE FORCE I wonder…

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.120
You should! When I'm older…

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.820
I'm going to join the Leaf Police Force too!

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.910
Forgive me, Sasuke…

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.240
This is the last time.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.450
No matter what happens from now, I will love you always.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.320
Sasuke dear!

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.870
Sasuke dear!

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.660
By the way… Have you been back to the Hidden Leaf Village, Sasuke dear?

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.990
What? Ignoring me again?

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.660
What about reviving the Uchiha Clan? You're the lone survivor, right?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.030
Hello! Are you there, Sasuke?!

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.280
Chino, stop it.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.120
Whose side are you on anyway? You know, you…

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.410
Hey, where are we going?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.910
Ignoring me again!

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.160
I mean… Hey.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.200
My name isn't "hey"!

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.490
You asked if I'm going to look for Fuushin.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.030
The answer is yes.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.570
Huh?

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.070
That's what I should do right now.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.910
A-Any ideas on where to look?

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.530
The only thing that can create an Exploding Human

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.780
is a Kekkei Genkai.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.410
H-Hey, Sasuke dear… Hold on a minute…

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.740
You think you'll find him inside that really scary-looking cave?

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.990
Ignoring me again!

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.990
You're Sasuke, right?

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.370
You can call me Yamato.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.030
Since you're watching over this place, it must mean that Orochimaru is here.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.160
O-Orochimaru? You mean that—?!

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.620
What's the purpose of your visit?

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.120
I can't allow just anyone through to see Orochimaru.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.530
Regarding the Exploding Humans that attacked the Hidden Leaf…

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.160
It's possible Orochimaru may have information about the perpetrator.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.700
Did you send word about this to Lord Sixth?

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.070
I intend to, if I get results.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.910
It would be much easier for us to coordinate things,

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.030
if you'd send us progress reports…

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.120
However…

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.820
You're doing this all for the sake for the Hidden Leaf, right?

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.030
Yeah…

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.370
Then there's nothing else to say.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.070
I'll send Lord Sixth a report.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.660
Remember, we're comrades.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:23.070
I'm sure Mr. Kakashi also taught you the importance of trust and teamwork.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.120
Thank you…

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.160
It's been a long time, Sasuke.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.490
You've brought some interesting-looking friends with you.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.320
Do you know Fuushin of the Lightning Gang?

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.780
What? Not even a greeting? You're as blunt as ever.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.950
Tell me everything you know.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.030
Is that any way to ask a person something?

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.950
Hurry up.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.450
Fuushin possesses a Kekkei Genkai…

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.990
I believe he originally was a member of En Oyashiro's guard unit.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.950
En Oyashiro?

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.660
He's not affiliated with any group.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.120
Even though he's a shinobi, he's an arms trader.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.070
He'll sell weapons to anyone for the right price,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.200
so he's known as the "Merchant of Death."

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.370
He's amassed a huge fortune during his lifetime.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.530
Where is he?

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.070
Who knows…

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.030
He has a hideout even better hidden than mine.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.990
I think finding him will be very difficult.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:52.030
For you, even the difficult is easy.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.990
Does that mean you trust me?

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:04.070
Well, I don't know where to find him, but I can lure him out.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.820
However… that may cause a few problems.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.990
Why do you think I came here?

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:19.570
How unlike you… I'm just doing what I have to.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.990
I sense the wind.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.820
Wait here. It will take some time to prepare.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.070
Sasuke dear!

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.070
I didn't know that you knew Orochimaru.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.030
I don't recall ever telling you.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.030
Sasuke!

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.530
Hey! Why didn't you let me know you're coming?

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.660
Sasuke dear…

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.240
"Sasuke dear"?!

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.240
What? Is she your girlfriend, Sasuke?

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.990
You mean, that ugly hag?

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.410
Hey! Who're you calling ugly?!

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.320
Sasuke, say it's not true!

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.530
It's not true.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.990
You should've seen the look of panic on your face.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.070
Shut up!

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.120
If it weren't for that big mouth of yours!

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.660
That's no excuse for looking like…

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.120
- It's been awhile. - it's the end of the world!

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.450
You've been continuing your travels?

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.950
Yeah.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.070
You haven't gone back to Hidden Leaf Village?

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.410
See, you're worried sick about Sasuke.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.570
You're really getting on my nerves!

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.120
Quiet, you guys.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.990
I'm ready. Shall we go?

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.910
Lord Orochimaru, are you going out?

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.070
Sasuke and I are going to the sea.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.820
Huh?!

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.740
The ocean? With Sasuke?

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.700
You all will stay and mind the fort.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.570
The sea with Lord Orochimaru? I can't quite picture it.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.240
Wait, that's news to me too.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.820
To be more precise, a solitary island in the sea.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.410
There's a paradise for the wealthy there.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.950
And that's where En Oyashiro is?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.370
If he takes the bait.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.620
- Nowaki. - Yeah.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.950
Sasuke…

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.780
Bleh!

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.120
What's with that girl? Wanna fight?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.370
Oh, what a drag.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.660
Sasuke working for the sake of strangers…

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:00.700
The Hidden Leaf was attacked… They're not strangers…

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.320
But he didn't return to the village.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.320
I wonder if it's hard for him to go back?

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.450
Don't you guys get it?

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.160
The big war might be over,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.030
but there are still lots of dangerous characters lurking around.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.870
As long as Sasuke has those eyes…

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.450
shinobi will continue to attack the village.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.240
So by showing that Sasuke Uchiha isn't in Hidden Leaf Village

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.530
and he's still journeying around the world,

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.820
it lessens the possibility that the village will be harmed.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.200
So then, Sasuke has to continue traveling?

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.120
That might be it.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.620
Still…

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.410
The fact that you, the one who instigated the destruction of the Hidden Leaf,

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.120
the assassination of the Fourth Kazekage and countless other horrific crimes,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.620
can still move around freely is quite astonishing.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.280
I'm not free.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.870
And who are you to talk, Sasuke?

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.780
By all rights, you should be locked up.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.530
But even Kabuto,

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.030
one of the war criminals from the Fourth Ninja World War

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.870
is now the director of an orphanage…

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.700
Kabuto is?

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.200
Of course, compared to me,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.870
the likelihood that Kabuto will resort to evil is lower.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.240
How can you be so sure?

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.070
Don't you trust the power of Itachi Uchiha?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.070
You and I, and Kabuto could just be insurance…

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.490
in case something happens that cannot be countered with common sense.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.120
Insurance?

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.410
In every era, a maverick appears.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.660
When that happens, there may be a need for people like us

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.320
who possess powers considered to be inhuman.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.740
There are things that cannot be protected by righteousness alone.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.950
If that's the case, keeping us around like pets might be mutually beneficial.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.740
But…

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:25.530
your friend would never even think of such a tactic.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.410
Probably not.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.570
There… You can see it in the distance.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.200
Where are we?

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.950
This is an island that you can't find on any map.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.280
Oh… Let's go.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.280
What is this place?

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.990
It's called the Coliseum.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.870
Coliseum?

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.660
Is everyone enjoying themselves so far?

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.030
Honors to the victor! Despair to the vanquished!

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.030
As you know, the rules are simple!

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.030
The one with your ID tag goes up against one with another person's ID tag.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.120
And the winner is whoever manages to take his opponent's ID tag…

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.030
Simply put, it's a survival match!

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.030
What's going on, Orochimaru?

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.620
You heard the explanation.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:04.490
The wealthy patrons here pit their shinobi against shinobi employed by others.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.570
The losing shinobi becomes theirs.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.620
And now, today's semi-final match!

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.530
Now entering the ring…

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.620
Wearing the ID tag of President Makibi of the Makibi Corporation…

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.240
Raimei, the Black Lightning Flash!

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.990
His opponent…

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.910
Wearing the ID tag of President Himeyuri of the Himeyuri Company…

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.200
Suzuran, the Eerie Flame of the White Moon!

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.240
This place is like a casino.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.070
All right, let's begin!

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.950
It's now or never, no foul play, no grudges afterwards…

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.700
A single-bout challenge!

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.240
Ready?

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.070
Fight!

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.030
I don't have time to waste on sick hobbies.

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:11.280
Where is En Oyashiro?

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:12.990
I wonder…

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:18.700
But this is about the only place that he'll show up.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.070
Although, he won't come if there's no shinobi he wants.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.450
Whoa! Suzuran is down!

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.120
The winner is Raimei!

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.820
President Makibi is overjoyed!

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.450
You're useless!

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.780
Why do you think I kept you all this time?!

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.410
You ingrate…

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.280
This place is worthless.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.570
Then why don't you help?

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.030
To a victim, the assailant and a third party are no different.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:01.030
People are no better than the assailant if they didn't try to help.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:09.030
If you only pity the loser and do nothing to stop the decadence of the rich…

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.410
you're just as guilty, Sasuke.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.870
Chino, stop.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.200
Chino!

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.280
Was this sight too shocking for a child?

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.990
No, she's older than me.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.200
What?

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.070
The wait is finally over!

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.120
Now, for the main event!

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.200
Wearing En Oyashiro's ID tag is Futsu!

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.160
It seems he took the bait.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:50.240
And his opponent will be wearing Lord Orochimaru's ID tag…

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.570
The legendary shinobi who attacked the Five Kage Conference…

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.030
The last Uchiha… Sasuke Uchiha!

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.660
What is the meaning of this?!

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.450
I told you. Oyashiro will only appear for something he wants.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.490
He is…a collector of Kekkei Genkai.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.120
A collector of Kekkei Genkai?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.660
Yes… As for you with your Sharingan, Sasuke…

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.240
He probably wants you so bad, he can taste it.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.280
Couldn't he have just searched for me if he knew I was here?

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.200
Oyashiro is a careful man.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.070
He can easily camouflage his scent, let alone his appearance and form.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.370
Who knows where he is?

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:47.450
However, he will definitely appear after the match for the ID tag transfer.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.990
That's the custom here.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.700
Wait a minute, could this be a default?

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.490
Now go…

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.240
He's here! He arrives, ready to go!

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.280
Sasuke Uchiha has appeared!

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.030
So that's Sasuke Uchiha.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.660
Let me see your Sharingan.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.160
All right, let us begin!

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.780
It's now or never, no foul play, no grudges afterwards…

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.120
A single-bout challenge!

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.370
Ready… Fight!

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.700
Vapor Style: Solid Fog Jutsu, eh?

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.030
P-President Makibi?

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.870
Is he all right?!

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.030
A-Ambulance! Call an ambulance!

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.030
An Exploding Human?

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.070
The Chi no Ike Clan?

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.820
Seems the Uchiha Clan who suffered long through persecution

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.990
were also complicit in the persecution of others…

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.990
Did Itachi know about this?

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.620
You might find something if you go to Hell Valley.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.070
I want to see this Hell Valley with my own eyes…

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:04.200
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Sasuke's Story: Sunrise, Part 3: Fuushin"

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.780
As the only survivor of the Uchiha Clan, I'll…

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:28.320
Tune in again!
