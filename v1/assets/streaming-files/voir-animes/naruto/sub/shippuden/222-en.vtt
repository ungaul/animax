00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.540
World of Dreams

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The longer you live…

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.080
the more you realize that only pain, suffering,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.670
and futility exist in this reality.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.290
Listen to me…

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.750
In this world,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.670
wherever there is light, there are always shadows.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.040
These are all nexuses,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.500
causal relationships that cannot be separated.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.000
Normally, that is.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.170
He's talking about discarding all the bad things in the real world

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.040
and escaping inside a dream that's full of good things!

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.250
Since it's a dream, everything is how you want it!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Even those who are dead can be alive again!

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.920
A world of only victors… a world of only peace…

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.920
a world of only love.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.500
I will create such a world.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.000
Again, Rin…

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.500
I'll create a world where we can be together again.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.830
I shall sever the nexuses…

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.790
of this world…

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.830
That's why I've come back.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.000
I hope no one saw you.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.290
I'm the only one who saw him.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.040
Obito slaughtered everyone, so we're safe.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.130
He didn't seem to want to kill Kakashi though.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.630
But Kakashi didn't see anything.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.750
When reinforcements from the Hidden Leaf arrived,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.540
he was screaming, "Who killed the enemy?!"

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.250
So you still felt loyalty to your one-time teammate?

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.210
No, it doesn't matter to me anymore

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.580
whether he's alive or dead in this world.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.540
Kakashi will exist in the world we'll create.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.500
Rin too…

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.000
Madara, teach me how to create this world of dreams.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.130
I don't need your thanks anymore.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.080
Come here.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.460
Starting today, you will be the savior.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.960
Look into my eye.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.960
You are inside my genjutsu.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.630
It's still a blank canvas,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.000
but I can project my will upon it to create whatever I want.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.040
And even control them.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.790
Anything is possible,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.540
since I'm linked to, and borrowing, the power of the Gedo Statue.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.210
Like this, see?

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.000
We'll use this genjutsu to create the ideal world.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.540
And then, we'll cast the genjutsu on everyone

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.460
and bring them here.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.500
The scale of this jutsu is accomplished

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.000
by using the moon instead of our eyes.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.880
So that an entire world of dreams is achieved.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.670
You make it sound so simple, but I still don't quite get it.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.750
Let me explain,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.540
starting with the Sage of Six Paths and Ten Tails.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.210
Isn't the Ten Tails just a legend?

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.170
Legends are always derived from something real.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.750
The Tailed Beasts that roam the world…

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.170
resulted when the Sage of the Six Paths

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.630
split up the power of the Ten Tails.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.460
Do you have proof that story is true?!

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.540
I do.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.920
After I obtained the cells of Hashirama Senju,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.210
I implanted them into my wound.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.210
At that time, nothing happened…

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.080
It was only when I was starting to die of old age…

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.170
that my Rinnegan awakened.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.330
And it simultaneously led to the undoing of a certain seal.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.460
I was then able to summon, and extract,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.040
the husk of the Ten Tails from a Seal Stone.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.960
The Ten Tail's husk?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.250
I call it the Gedo Statue.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.000
And the Seal Stone is what we know as the moon.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.960
Immediately, I used the statue's body as a catalyst

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
to culture Hashirama's cells into what you see before you.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.580
One could say that these artificial beings are clones of Hashirama.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.130
Although they are reduced in quality.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.040
The Rinnegan cannot be awakened

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.210
without the possessing both Uchiha and Senju powers.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.040
And the statue cannot be controlled easily.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.330
You have Senju cells attached to the right half of you.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.080
Even if you never awaken the Rinnegan,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.080
you should be able to eventually control the statue.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.420
Did you see them? That redhead's eyes?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.580
So they're Madara's Rinnegan, huh…

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.170
They're Madara's actual eyes.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.790
When that kid was younger…

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.960
he secretly transplanted them without anyone noticing!

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.170
Nagato is of Senju bloodline.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.580
And the only other person in addition to Madara

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.710
who can summon the Gedo Statue.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:12.460
As Madara said, first, we win him over and…

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.630
Huh?! What're you gonna do?

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.170
I'm going straight for him.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.920
H-Hey, shouldn't you plan a strategy first?

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.630
I don't need to do that.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.210
Obito…

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.130
I shall teach you the Uchiha Forbidden Jutsu,

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.210
the Six Paths Jutsu.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.750
And the Shadow and Light Style Jutsu.

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.290
I've implanted my will inside this one…

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.420
Think of him as being half of me.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.500
Though he'll be degraded too.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.130
You can use these beings that I created

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.540
using Shadow and Light Style Jutsu as your soldiers.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.210
That Black Rod was created as a physical manifestation of my will.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.130
Use it when you perform the Six Paths Jutsu…

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:36.670
Now, go on… Until the time when I will be revived…

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.290
You shall be…

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.790
Who are you?

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.710
I am Madara Uchiha.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.830
Madara?

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.460
You're either a criminal or a total idiot

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.130
to claim Uchiha Madara's name.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.920
Why'd you approach us?

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.750
The Rinnegan…

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.080
To guide those who awaken it, is the mission

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.210
our organization has been entrusted with since ages past.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.580
You know about my eyes?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.420
You are the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Paths,

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.000
who dreamed of world peace and stability.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.920
Only the villages of large nations are showered in light.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.000
Leaving your small country's village in the shadow, dying.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.630
That is why your eye has awakened here.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.330
Wherever light strikes, there are always shadows.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.040
So long as there is a concept of victors…

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.710
the vanquished will also similarly exist.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.670
The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace initiates wars.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.710
And hatred is born in order to protect love.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.330
These are all nexuses,

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.500
causal relationships that cannot be separated.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.710
Normally, that is.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.750
But a world of just victors, peace and love…

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.960
such a world can be created too.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.670
If you allow us to collaborate, you can learn how.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.460
As soon as you attain the true power of the Rinnegan….

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.790
Your very own world can be immediately actualized.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.210
Now…

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.960
I can't do that.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.170
You're just trying to use us.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.630
Your offer sounds way too convenient.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.250
One can only reach the true world

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.040
after knowing another's pain and shedding tears alongside them.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.210
Shedding tears alongside them, huh?

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.040
You mean in revenge?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.290
No, that's not what I meant.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.710
I meant in mutual understanding.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.130
Stop talking so idealistically.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.670
No such thing exists in this world.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.500
Let's go, Konan… Nagato.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.830
We can't trust these guys!

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.210
Don't you dare approach us again!

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.130
I'll wait here at the same time every day.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.880
You'll eventually realize it too.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.400
Who the hell are you?!

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.070
The bodyguards of this village.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.280
This is a warning.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.820
Leave this village now!

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.320
The hell with them… Let's kill em!

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.190
Water Style: Raging Waves!

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.150
Wind Style: Gale Palm!

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.570
Damn! We can't get near them!

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.570
Die!

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.230
Take one step and I'll skewer you!

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.980
We won't let you take a single step into this village!

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.110
Give up now!

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.570
Is it because of the rain?!
Now's my chance!

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.860
Sorry! Are you okay?

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.070
Damn it! There's no end to this!

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.650
I didn't want to use this, but…

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.610
Do you belong to Hanzo's gang?!

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.320
We're wearing his headband, but we're not his subordinates.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.360
But some day,

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.480
we want to bring peace to the world just like Hanzo.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.320
In other words, you're just his copycats.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.900
We're not copycats!

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.690
We will keep peace in this village!

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.280
Not through violence, but through negotiations!

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.190
Are you crazy?

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.980
This village lies between two great nations!

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.860
As long as they're at war with each other,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.690
the fighting won't end!

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.110
The strong will take everything from the weak!

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.780
That's how the world is!

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.940
We're fighting to change that way of thinking!

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.030
Each one of you must secretly wish for peace!

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.110
Listen. One piece of straw is weak…

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.230
But when you put three together, it becomes much…

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.900
Damn it! I'm just trying to say,

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.070
the more you have, the stronger it is!

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.690
Yahiko… You're so bad at making speeches…

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.940
Whatever!

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.940
Look, we're not gonna kill you.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.110
Just get out of here!

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.070
I won't guarantee that we won't attack again!

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.150
Fine. We'll do this dozens of times until you give up…

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.900
A hundred times, even.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.690
But just remember, it'll be more painful the next time!

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.980
Retreat!

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.860
Earlier, when you tried to attack me, you protected the kid.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.860
Thank you.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.530
We're war orphans too.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.150
You're such funny kids…

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.780
You appear out of nowhere and ask to protect this village.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.610
It's to change this land.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.980
War will never leave this land.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.280
Nothing will change.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.110
Yahiko…

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.730
Seems like things are changing, little by little.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.900
We're ninja who left the village

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.070
because we didn't think much of Hanzo's ways.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:39.690
But we were getting sick of this lifestyle too.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.280
I looked into your eyes

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.780
and began to feel like starting over again…

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.780
But I don't feel like going back to Hanzo.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.070
So take us in as your lackeys!

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.110
No!

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.980
What?! But earlier, you…!

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.110
Not as lackeys, but as comrades.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.110
I'm Yahiko. This is Nagato and Konan.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.690
I'm Kyusuke the Swift.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.860
If you need to gather intel, you can leave it to these fast legs.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.820
Then go and find me other villages that are suffering like this one.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.280
Yahiko…

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:26.440
What?

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.030
You should name our group.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.030
There are more of us now. It's gonna be necessary soon.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.690
A name…

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.940
How about…the Akatsuki.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.900
This nation weeps from the sufferings of war.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.980
So we will change this nation…

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.190
no, this world, and welcome a new dawn!

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.940
Akatsuki…

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.070
That's a great name.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.400
Akatsuki! It's decided!

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.820
– Yeah! – Yeah!

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.110
It's like… the Akatsuki suddenly grew.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.440
They all bought into your dream.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.530
Actually, they're all tired of war.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.650
If everyone unites, I know we can have peace.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.110
Say, where's Konan?

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.400
She went out a while ago.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.900
Why?

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:41.940
I dunno…

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.190
This is…

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:47.940
Konan's…

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.730
"Dear Konan…"

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.480
"From the first moment I saw you…"

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.690
Is this…?!

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.070
It's a love letter.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.820
"I've wanted to ask you how you feel about me."

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.320
"I'll be waiting anxiously on the back terrace… Kyusuke."

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.900
Don't tell me… Konan's gone over there?!

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.900
I dunno…

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.730
Yahiko, didn't you have something to do?

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.900
Huh?!

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.860
Oh yeah, yeah! I forgot. I need to go to the john!

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.150
I'm gonna wet myself!

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.610
That guy!

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.150
Running's not the only thing he's fast at!

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:46.360
More friends also means… more competition in love!

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.030
No kidding…

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.940
Hey, Nagato!

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.610
Do you like Konan, Yahiko?

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.610
Stupid! It's nothing like that!

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.150
I think Konan likes you.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.360
Huh?!

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:05.860
Oh, she's coming back.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.570
I know you're there…

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.230
Yahiko, Nagato.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.900
Konan… What did you tell him?

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.570
I told him that I don't have time for a relationship

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.030
until we make the Akatsuki's dream come true.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:22.650
Isn't that right?

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:24.780
Konan…

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.610
Yahiko!

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.280
Can you help me out with some training?

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.360
That jutsu…doesn't work… in the rain!

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.400
Oiled paper…

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.030
Great idea.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.070
I experimented.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.070
If you hesitate, I'll leave you behind!

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.530
Like I'd let you!

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.230
Hanzo is setting an example for us shinobi

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.070
by fighting to bring peace to this world.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.110
We will prove that the Akatsuki will surpass him one day!

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.400
I approve of an organization that seeks

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.980
to resolve issues through pacifist means.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.360
It will help realize my dream

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.690
of uniting the Five Nations without force.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.900
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Creeping Shadow."

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.900
So they are the apprentices of that brat!

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:06.940
CREEPING SHADOW Tune in again!
