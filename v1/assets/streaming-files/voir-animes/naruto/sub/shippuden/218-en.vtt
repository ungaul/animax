WEBVTT

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.980
I had Dad, Mom, and Pervy Sage.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.900
Kids love looking up to their hero.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.440
That's why I can keep running forward without hesitation.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.610
I will become the greatest Hokage of them all!

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.780
That's my dream!

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.690
I guess cracking that mask of yours will have to come first.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.070
You will not touch the statue!

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.710
The Secret of the Transportation Technique

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.170
Naruto! You know about his abilities, right?

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.630
Your window of opportunity is the instant

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.880
he tries to suck you inside himself.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.040
That's when he's solid.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.170
If you attack him normally, you'll just pass right through him.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.290
So it's like you're aiming for a counterattack.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.000
Diversionary tactics are a must.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.130
Create an opening through continuous close combat!

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.130
Avoid using big moves!

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.040
I know! That's why I made a clone!

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.880
Bee! Please raise me up high!

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.790
I'm good to go.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.960
We should avoid attacks that touch him directly.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.790
Up you go!

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.080
Super Mini Tailed Beast Bomb!

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.500
Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.710
Twin Fangs!

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.580
This one!

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.000
I guess not. Then it must be…

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.040
Nice timing!

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.790
I'll deal with you…

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.170
first!

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.170
That's so cool, Bushier Brow Sensei!

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.080
Okay! I've infused more than enough chakra!

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.880
Sorry, but…

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.460
I'm going for the statue!

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.130
Kamui!

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.330
If I gouge out its head…

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.040
it shouldn't be able to survive, statue or not!

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.380
So naïve.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.040
What happened?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.380
Don't tell me…

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:05.830
He vanished?

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.000
Naruto!

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.960
These boulders are in the way! Damn it!

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.750
Bee!

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.960
I've got it!

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.000
Fly!

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.130
He cut through that boulder with his Lightning Blade.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.250
Nice, Kakashi!

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.630
I'm not going to make it in time!

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.130
Naruto! Just keep going!

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.000
I'll take care of the kunai!

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.830
Kamui!

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.830
Damn it!

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.750
He's really strong. I can't get my attacks to hit him.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:25.960
Are you all right?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.540
Yeah… But if even that attack is no good…

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.080
What can we do?!

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.250
What's happening all of a sudden?

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.250
Hey, Kakashi… Did you see that?

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.040
– Yeah. – Huh?

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.710
There's a crack in his mask.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.960
Huh? Where, where?!

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.540
You're right… On the left side!

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.080
Looks like Naruto's earlier attack grazed him

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.630
before it passed through!

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.920
Nice going, Naruto! Let's keep it up just like that!

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.540
All right! Now I feel like we have a chance!

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.540
To be honest, it didn't look to me like Naruto's attack landed.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.170
You're doing it again… You always say things like that!

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.170
Are you saying it was something else?

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.250
What's going on?

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.380
From the looks of it,

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.540
that crack isn't from Naruto's punch.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.630
It looks like it was cut with something sharp…

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:52.710
Wait a minute!

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.000
You're wide open!

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.330
Don't mock me!

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.040
Uchiha Flame Formation!

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.210
Hot! Hot! Hot!

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.630
Whoa!

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.000
Are you all right, Octopops and Eight-o?!

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.670
Do I look all right?

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.170
Now that he's erected a barrier,

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.210
we have no choice but to tackle the masked guy first.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.170
That's been my plan since the beginning, y'know!

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.580
Damn it!

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.830
Could it be…? No… That's impossible…

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:36.380
But…

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.170
I'd never heard that the Kamui could be stopped!

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.380
But if the crack in his mask

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.380
was caused by the kunai I used my Kamui on…

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.040
That means his ninjutsu is…

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.420
It's no use just thinking about it.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.920
It's an implausible theory, but it's not impossible, either…

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.750
Guy, Naruto, Bee…

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.040
– Yeah? – Hmm?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.540
There's something I want to test.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Help me out.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.420
Let's do it!
Okay!

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.380
Yo!

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.040
Impressive destructive power.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.210
How's that?!

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.330
You don't have any time to suck me in, do you?!

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.500
You underestimate the Sharingan too much.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.170
I can read your movements.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.710
I'll keep these.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.170
He materializes while he absorbs things.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.210
Now!

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.710
Rasengan!

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.420
Don't you understand that it's futile?

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.080
It's just like you said, Kakashi Sensei!

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.420
I don't really understand why,

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.330
but I finally landed an attack on him!

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.960
I see… Naruto didn't undo his Rasengan…

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:11.080
Kakashi… You used the Kamui to send the Rasengan away.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.750
I knew it…

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.630
I thought he had two different jutsu,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.080
one that lets him slip through things and

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.960
one to suck things in or take them out.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.710
But that's not the case.
– Huh? – Huh?

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.880
It's all one single jutsu!

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.290
It's one jutsu?

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.460
Yeah.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.670
Well, no one's better at jutsu analysis and breakdown than you.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.210
Can you explain his jutsu to us in simpler terms?

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.880
Knowing what it is might change how we approach the battle.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.830
The way his jutsu works is really simple…

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.130
You see, the jutsu he uses to absorb things,

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.460
and the one he uses to slip through objects

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.210
is the Transportation Technique.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.420
What do you mean? How can you tell?

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:00.880
Well…

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.580
Let me explain it in order.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.420
First, the crack in his mask.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.330
My kunai made that mark. I'm absolutely certain.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.080
From the look of the wound on his right shoulder,

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.670
I can tell it was caused from being hit by Naruto's Rasengan just now.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.920
What these two things have in common is that

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.710
they both involve areas of his body that were overlapping

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.380
and in contact with Naruto's body while he was slipping through him.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.630
There is another thing that the two have in common.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.040
That is…

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.290
A kunai and Rasengan that I transported

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.250
using my Kamui Jutsu caused those two things.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.080
In other words, from this,

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.000
I can tell his Transportation Technique is linked

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.080
to the same time-space as my Kamui!

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.420
W-Wait a second! What do you mean?

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.540
How come his Visual Jutsu and yours are linked?!

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:21.750
Are all Transportation Techniques… linked between all users?

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.880
No… They aren't… I suspect it's just him and me.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.920
Never mind that!

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.040
Why did your kunai hit and not my punch?

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.750
That's right, fool!

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.130
Even with shared time-spaces,

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.080
it should still be impossible to hit a guy

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.080
that can slip through things, ya fool.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.210
Except that our theory that he slips through things was wrong.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.670
What do you mean?

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.210
Although it looks like your attack slipped right through him,

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.670
in fact, only the part of his body that would have been

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.710
in contact with yours was transported into time-space.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.330
In other words, the left side of his mask

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.580
that your punch "slipped through" was simply transported

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:12.130
into time-space and no longer existed on this plane.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.040
At least materially.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.000
And then almost simultaneously,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.290
remember I hurled that kunai into time-space using Kamui?

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.210
Just as his momentum carried him forward

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:33.130
when he extended his arm toward you to grab you…

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:38.670
my kunai finished entering time-space and scored his mask.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.830
Did the same thing happen with the Rasengan?

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:41.830
Yeah…

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.000
So that's what happened.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.920
But how come both of your Visual Prowess's are linked?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.380
Kakashi, is he…?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.710
Where did you get that eye?!

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.710
Where, huh?

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.170
If anything, in the last Great War.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.540
The Battle of Kannabi Bridge…

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:23.170
The same battle where you earned the nickname "The Sharingan Hero."

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.670
Are you…?

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.500
I thought I told you not to flap your mouth so readily!

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:36.380
You're just all talk now! Your words are worthless!

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.080
It's too late for regrets.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.790
Reality just keeps cruelly moving ahead.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.880
You've seen reality, so you ought to know.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.130
Not one wish ever gets granted in this world.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.830
That's why I'm guiding it to the dream of Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.750
I'm going to create a world where it won't be necessary

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.920
for a hero to pathetically make excuses in front of a grave.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.710
Hey, are you all right, Kakashi?!

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.210
You bastard!

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.670
Are you still blabbing on about that?!

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.210
I thought I told you too!

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.540
I'm not giving up my dream of becoming Hokage!

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.790
I've been entrusted with way too much from way too many!

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.080
Naruto!

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.420
Heh!

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.500
Entrusted, eh?

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.000
What if you were to lose the things

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.540
Jiraiya and the Fourth Hokage entrusted you with?

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.960
I wonder what they would think?

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.130
I'm always thinking that

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.250
I want to do something about this hatred.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.540
But I'm not sure how to go about it yet.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.540
If I can't find the answer myself,

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.170
I shall pass the quest on to you!

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.420
I'm glad I made you my student!

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.250
FOURTH HOKAGE

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.130
You have to find the answer yourself. FOURTH HOKAGE

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.630
Even I don't know it.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.500
I know you'll find the answer.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.250
I believe in you.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.540
Naruto, if you fail at the things you were entrusted with…

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.000
I wonder what you will think of yourself as well?

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.460
If you postpone dealing with problems

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.040
and cover it up with the word "hope,"

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.750
all that awaits you is an empty reality.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:47.040
Both the entrusted and those that did the entrusting, all in vain.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.290
I sealed half of the Nine Tails' chakra inside of you,

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.290
because I believed you could control its power.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.170
Because you are my son.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.380
Naruto, switch with me!

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.170
There's something I want to say to him.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:25.330
Sorry, but your words don't apply to this guy.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.330
Is that Nine Tails?

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.290
The Fourth Hokage entrusted him with me.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.420
Not only has Naruto befriended me…

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.540
but he's completely mastered my power as well!

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.830
The Fourth Hokage sealed me within Naruto

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.500
as a force to help take you down.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:58.000
Go, Naruto! You won't fail!

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.500
Yeah!

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.290
That man, he couldn't be…

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.250
There's absolutely no way!

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.630
Kakashi, I've got a pretty good idea of what you're thinking right now.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.170
But leave it be.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.880
There's no time to wallow in sentimentality.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.630
Your former subordinate Naruto has already jumped into action!

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.000
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Who Are You?"

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.210
How stupid, jumping in alone.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.000
WHO ARE YOU?

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.170
Tune in again!
