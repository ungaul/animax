WEBVTT

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.100
I'm not done yet!

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.200
Over here!

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.630
Fate took us straight to the Leaf's Sannin.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.000
What do you want?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.530
We finally found him.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.100
We found Jiraiya Sensei.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.330
Damn! Enemies?!

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.030
Run now!

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.730
Nagato, go!

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.670
But I couldn't truly accept a Leaf Ninja.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm sure you would understand why.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.010
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.100
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.520
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.440
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.240
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.540
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.750
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.380
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:01.010
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.010
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.180
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.400
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.900
koete Someday...

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.030
Origin of Pain Origin of Pain Teach us ninjutsu.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.530
You're all ninja from the Hidden Leaf, right?

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.930
Thank you. This is for you.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.930
Shall I kill these children?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Wha-?!

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.170
I've seen many war orphans. It's pitiful.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.030
They would be better off

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.170
if we just put them out of their misery right now.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.630
Orochimaru, enough!

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.030
You go on ahead with Tsunade.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.030
I'll stay here and look after them for a while.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400
Huh?!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.300
It is the least I can do.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.800
My parents were killed by ninja of the Hidden Leaf.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.470
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you for the food!

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.130
Grilled fish in an instant

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.930
- with my Fire Style Jutsu. - But Jiraiya Sensei seemed

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.130
a little different than them.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.300
Sensei! I'm getting the hang of fishing!

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.300
Oh yeah? You're becoming more and more promising!

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.730
The four of us started living together.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.130
Soon after, a certain incident took place.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.130
Incident?

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.770
Yahiko!

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.270
A lingering ninja attacked us and nearly killed Yahiko.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.830
That is when I struck out and killed that ninja instead.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.070
And I did it...without realizing it.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.000
Are you all right, Yahiko?!

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.230
It seems I possessed a special power.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.630
The Ocular Jutsu known as the Rinnegan.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.330
As a result, Jiraiya Sensei, who had been hesitant about training us,

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.130
began to teach us ninjutsu.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.830
He said he was teaching us so we could protect ourselves.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.770
But I think, in my case,

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.630
it was so I could control the power of the Rinnegan.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.230
But I was afraid of my power.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.600
Hate had caused me to go berserk.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.270
I thought what I did was wrong and was consumed with guilt.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.530
But Sensei pulled me from the depths.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.030
Is it about that incident?

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.800
That day...

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.100
When that man hurt Yahiko, I was so mad at him.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.530
Everything went blank in my head.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.430
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.870
Before I realized it, the man was dead.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.970
After that, I got so scared.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.670
This hatred made me lose myself... and I killed someone.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.730
What I did was wrong!

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.800
There had to be a better way!

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.970
Nagato!

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.100
I really don't know if it was right or wrong.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.800
But thanks to you, Yahiko didn't die.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.930
You protected your friend.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.400
That had to be the right thing to do.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.900
No one can blame you for that.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.970
Before I realized it, I had already accepted Sensei.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.130
When you are hurt, you learn to hate.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.330
On the other hand, when you hurt someone, you are resented.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.630
But you start to feel guilty as well.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:41.470
However, understanding such pain enables you to be kind to others.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.800
Knowing pain helps us to grow up, to mature.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.230
And to grow up means being able to think

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.400
and make one's decisions on their own.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.500
To know and reflect on pain, and come up with your own answer.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.930
Jiraiya Sensei seemed to be asking himself the same question.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.500
He hadn't found an answer either.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.130
Just like you haven't.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.900
Back then, I was able to come up with an answer right away.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.700
I just want to protect those two.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.700
No matter what kind of pain I have to endure.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:34.930
I see.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:41.470
What are you always pondering, Sensei?

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.330
There is so much war in this world.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:51.100
Only hatred exists. I want to do something about it.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:58.300
And to know what the answer to true peace is.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.400
Three years passed.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.930
I felt that I had grown stronger physically and mentally through training.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.370
But Jiraiya Sensei's words always kept coming back to me

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.100
from somewhere deep inside.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:25.470
Sensei had told me that perhaps the answer rested in my Rinnegan.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.970
Long ago, people constantly fought.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.930
Wars never ended. It was an age far worse than today.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.230
In such an age, there appeared a monk who, for the first time,

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:49.330
preached the truth of chakra and tried to bring peace to the world.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.730
It is said he traveled throughout the world advocating his teachings,

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.230
which he called ninshu.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.830
Time passed and ninshu became known as ninjutsu.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.700
Ninjutsu isn't about armed power.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.170
It is a teaching that guides people towards peace.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.970
This monk was known as the Sage of the Six Paths

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.800
and was called the savior of this world.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.870
Like you, he possessed the Rinnegan.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.500
"We are the ones who create peace and order."

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.330
Those are the monk's words.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.830
He must have believed that

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.330
the era would come when people truly understood each other.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.970
Maybe...you are the reincarnation of that monk.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.700
I have a feeling that those eyes of yours

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.900
have been entrusted with the monk's hopes.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.470
Sensei entrusted me with the quest for peace,

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.730
and then left us by ourselves.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.430
With Yahiko as our leader, we began to take action.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.870
Our organization quickly gained fame.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:16.370
People approved of our efforts to build peace without the use of force.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.500
But the world was at war.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.070
The Three Great Nations' War between the Stone, Leaf and Sand villages.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.370
Hanzo, the leader of the Hidden Rain,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.730
heard rumors about our organization and approached us.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.300
We couldn't be ignored anymore.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.930
He wanted to use us as the axis to negotiate peace

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.730
with the three Great Nations.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.800
We were to use our power to secure an agreement of peace

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.030
among the three nations.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.570
We agreed to cooperate with his proposal.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.070
But that was the beginning of all of our misfortunes.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.830
We were naive children.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.230
Misfortunes?

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.930
What happened?

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.370
Because of that, Yahiko died.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.230
Died?!

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.130
It was all a trap laid by Hanzo.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.430
He suspected that

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.070
we would steal his power over the Hidden Rain from him.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.470
For that reason alone, Yahiko was...

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.170
The following day,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.070
we went to a certain location to make arrangements.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.800
Hanzo's subordinates and the Leaf's Anbu Black Ops were already there.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.430
Hanzo had schemed with a man named Danzo from the Hidden Leaf

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.430
to get rid of us.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.000
Danzo teamed up with Hanzo in order to usurp the seat of Hokage.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.930
Hanzo teamed up with Danzo to protect his own position of power.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.400
Your organization is a nuisance to me.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.770
Yahiko...

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.970
You are the leader, so you must die.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.570
If you resist, this woman will die.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.870
You! The red-haired one.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.570
Use that to kill Yahiko.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.200
Then I will spare you and the woman.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:32.770
Don't, Nagato!

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.970
Never mind me!

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.830
Both of you escape!

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.930
Nagato.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.370
Kill me.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.970
I just want to protect those two.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.730
No matter what kind of pain I have to endure.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.530
Nagato!

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:58.930
No!

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.470
Hurry it up.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.830
Or do you want this woman to die?!

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.100
Konan...

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.500
Yahi-!

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.500
You and Konan must survive... no matter what it takes.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.800
You are...the savior...of this world.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:03.830
I know...

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.800
you can...do it.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.470
Yahiko!

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.170
I have a huge dream!

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.270
Kill them!

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.230
If the fighting doesn't stop...

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.730
I'll become the god of this world!

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.300
He repelled it!

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.770
How?!

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.430
Did we get him?

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.200
Nagato... Konan, hold onto Yahiko and stay still.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.370
Not bad, kid!

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.000
You escaped even while being hit by my Fire Style Jutsu!

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.170
You're no ordinary kid.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.230
Those eyes...

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.700
Get him!

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.730
Summoning Jutsu!

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.630
Gedo Statue!

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.530
This is...

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.530
What...is that?!

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.300
Nagato... No! Don't use that!

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.800
We're dead if that touches us!

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.770
So you were the leader behind the scenes.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.470
It's quite a surprise that you possess the Rinnegan.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.300
Nagato...

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.300
Teleportation Jutsu!

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.430
Yahiko died...

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.900
And from then on, I took over as the leader of our organization.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.530
I thought I had grown up.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.200
But nothing had changed at all.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.570
It was just like the time my parents died.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.100
I was wrong.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.000
I realized that the answer I had come up with

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.870
was nothing more than crap.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.100
I owed him my life. He was my dream.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.230
He was my irreplaceable friend for whom I would have gladly died.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.500
Yahiko's death...

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.170
That was my second pain.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:16.350
When the fireworks suddenly explode in the air...
fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.850
I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face...
muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:31.070
sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly...

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:46.920
It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you...
kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:53.300
Because I always remember you, in situations like this...
kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto

00:20:53.660 --> 00:21:00.430
I can't help but think about the times we spent together.
mata omoidashiteshimau yo

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:09.900
I'm ready to forget you...
mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:14.030
It just tears at my heart too much.
konna ni mo kanashikute

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:21.200
I wonder... why did we meet each other?

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:24.960
doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes...

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:33.250
me wo tojireba It's like you are here.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:33.250
ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.030
It appears to have ended.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.200
How did it turn out?

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.170
It is as my vision foretold.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.970
Though I never thought it would end like this.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.830
Perhaps in that moment when Jiraiya chose not to give up,

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.430
all this became preordained.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:01.130
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Tale of Naruto Uzumaki"

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.970
This is my answer!

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.800
It's been such a long time since

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.130
all three of us got together!

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.530
You're right about that.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.630
Not since we were reunited during the invasion of Hidden Leaf Village.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.970
The days of the Ino-Shika-Cho Trio

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.630
when we were renown across the nations...

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:20.570
That was so long ago.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.070
We're not has-beens yet!

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.870
Say, why don't we do "that" for old times' sake?

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.900
Sounds good.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.830
Let's do it.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.030
Formation! Ino!

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.570
- Shika! - Cho!

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.700
We've still got it!

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.970
But you can't beat old comrades, eh?

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.000
Huh?

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.470
By the way, didn't we invite someone else today?

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.830
We ran into him yesterday.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.500
Oh yeah, we talked about getting together for a meal.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:47.630
Who was it?

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.770
Think hard!

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.270
Forgetting a comrade is the first sign of dementia!

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.100
Sir...

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.430
May I take your order?

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.100
It's been two hours since I ordered.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.930
Huh?! I'm so sorry!

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.570
I guess being forgotten runs in the family.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.970
Tune in again!
