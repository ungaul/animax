WEBVTT

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.970
So the guy in front of us is the real Madara.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.930
Then the guy we thought was Madara…isn't Madara?

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.090
So it seems…

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.970
As Tsuchikage, you've utilized the Akatsuki in the past.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.880
Can you speculate who that masked man might be?

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.800
There's no one I can think of.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.180
But it doesn't matter who he is! We still need to stop him!

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.430
Their headbands say "Shinobi."

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.430
But I see them wearing shinobi gear

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.430
distinctly from each of the Five Great Nations…

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.590
Is this a new allied army?

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.220
It does appear that we're at war.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.510
Coming from him...

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.130
He must have something in mind.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.010
But things don't seem like they're going as planned.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.470
Why else would he revive me in this state?

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.510
Who is the caster of the Reanimation Jutsu?

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.630
Who knows?

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.340
I'm Kabuto.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.380
I am…his collaborator.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.220
Speaking through a Reanimation Link?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.550
Such a sneaky one you are…

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.380
Your Reanimation is quite special.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.380
I've fixed you up so that you're even greater than you were in your glory days.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.430
You know what I was like during my "glory days"?

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.880
No.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.970
Which is why I want you to show me…

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.130
your legendary Uchiha power.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.340
I guess they won't be easy to capture.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.430
Very well…

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.510
Madara Uchiha

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.130
Here he comes!

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.050
Do not look directly into his eyes!

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.970
You can't use the Particle Style in your divided state right now…

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.300
Sensory Types! Watch Lord Mu!

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.930
Wait!

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.880
Gaara, you and Lord Tsuchikage must recover first.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.470
Naruto! Instead of your clones, go into that mode!

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.800
The truth is, I can't anymore.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.470
I used up my chakra in the earlier fight!

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.130
Do you want to dance too?

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.550
Don't underestimate me!

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.880
Fire Style!

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.630
Majestic Destroyer Flame!

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.380
His jutsu spans a wide area!

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.220
– Water Style! Wall of Water! – Water Style! Wall of Water!

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.630
Here he comes!

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.220
This is…as far as you'll go!

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.220
Massive Rasengan!

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.430
Earth Style: Mobile Core!

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.430
A Susano'o…

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.590
He's already activated the Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.340
How much longer, Naruto?!

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.260
Just hold on!

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.340
Sorry!

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.260
I'm ready!

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.340
Get back, everyone!

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.970
Go, Kazekage!

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.930
Earth Style: Lightened Boulder Jutsu!

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.970
I made the surrounding sand lighter too!

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.760
With sand this light, I could…!

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.090
Naruto!

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.010
Yeah! Let's go!

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.300
If it's like Sasuke's, external attacks are ineffective.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.840
So I should use the sand at Madara's feet!

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.630
Go!

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.050
Naruto!

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.510
Rasen Shuriken!

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.030
Why did the masked man specifically claim to be Madara?

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.620
The presence of Madara...

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.240
Even if he were a fraud,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.240
if you can convince the world of, his existence, it would tremble in fear.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.910
The name itself is power.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.200
That name made us throw caution to the wind…

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.410
It fooled us, then drew us all into war!

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.280
We've been had all along.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.780
Too much energy…

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.410
H-He…absorbed it!

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.370
What the…?! How?

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.370
How come he's got the Rinnegan?

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.120
My guess was right.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.660
What comes naturally after the Sharingan, is the Rinnegan.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.410
I awakened the Rinnegan just prior to my death.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.530
You said your name was Kabuto?

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.830
What did you do to this body?

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.080
Like I told you.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.330
I made you better than you were at your peak.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.490
You bastard… You know the secrets of my body?

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.830
You can't even read the Uchiha Stone Tablet!

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.660
But you still managed to decipher it?

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.990
I just tested some hypotheses drawn from years of data

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.330
from experiments Lord Orochimaru and I conducted.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.240
And now… You are verifying my hypotheses.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.240
You are able to achieve a piece of that God's…

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.080
the power of the Sage of Six Paths.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.370
Thanks to the power I built into you.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.780
Do not misunderstand.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.580
This is not power of your creation!

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.030
Damn!

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.780
N-No way…

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.240
What is that?

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.620
It's out of our league!

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.410
Is this the power of a god?

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.200
A meteorite? How did he…?

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.410
Is that really ninjutsu?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.660
We can't outrun it!

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.280
This is not good… Damn it!

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.530
It's still too early to give up!

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.660
Never give up without even trying!

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.200
Do what you can, no matter how small the effect it may have!

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.330
Lord Tsuchikage!

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.620
Everyone, get as far away from here as possible!

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.740
Hey!

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.030
Run!

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.330
Hurry!

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.160
You're taking us out too?

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.830
Of course.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.030
That was the original point of the Reanimation Jutsu…

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.780
To take others out with you.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.330
We'll be restored shortly.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.240
A shinobi that can fly…?

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.080
Then, is he that Fence Sitter brat from the Stone?

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.580
What's Gramps Tsuchikage trying to do?!

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.410
He's going to try to lighten the meteorite to stop it!

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.120
Earth Style: Lightened Boulder Jutsu!

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.240
Just a tad more…

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.490
A little more…to stop it!

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.280
That Fence Sitter brat…

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.120
He's gotten a little better.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.240
All right!

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.410
It's stopped!

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.490
We're saved… Leave it to Lord Tsuchikage.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.160
I thought we were goners.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.740
Well then…

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.410
What will you do about the second one, Ohnoki?

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.450
What was that?!

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.240
What happened?!

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.410
This is from our Relay Intel Unit.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.330
A giant boulder big enough to block out the sky

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.240
has been dropped onto the Fourth Company's battlefield.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.660
It's the source of this tremor!

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.200
Any further reports from the Fourth Company since then?

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.780
What's going on?

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.780
So many casualties… in just one sweep!

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.700
I'm sure of it…

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.330
It's Madara's jutsu or something close to it!

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.990
Lady Tsunade! At this rate…!

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.080
I'll go!

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.280
What in the world…

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.830
was that?!

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:25.830
Rubber Pops…

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.580
I'm just a clone, so why did you…?!

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.780
I feel bad about the others.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.780
But clone or not, you are needed here.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.910
In order for us to win.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.120
What about Gramps Tsuchikage?!

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.990
Gramps Tsuchikage!

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:52.910
It's okay.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.620
He's alive…

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.280
But he's seriously hurt!

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.910
So this is the power of the Sage of Six Paths…

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.580
Magnificent!

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.990
This landscape brings back memories.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.580
It's Kabuto, right?

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.490
How much do you really know?

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.200
About me?

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.450
I venture to guess…

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.370
In that battle against the First Hokage Hashirama,

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.080
you did not die at Final Valley.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.120
On that day…

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.580
though you lost to the First Hokage Hashirama,

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.870
you gained a portion of his power in return.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.030
Am I wrong?

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.330
No wonder…

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.910
You're well prepared.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.030
You know about our plan?

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.160
Not in detail…

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.620
But I am your ally.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.280
Although I'm not certain

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.910
if that fake Madara intends to carry out your plan exactly…

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.370
By the way… There are still some survivors.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.080
The Tsuchikage and Kazekage are especially persistent.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.620
What should we do?

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.240
There's something I want to check first.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.490
Summoning Jutsu!

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.200
My stomach…feels hot!

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.030
This chakra that summons me…

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.330
Is it Madara?!

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.910
It seems the Nine Tails hasn't been captured yet.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.660
That's the purpose of this war.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.830
The Nine Tails is sealed in a Jinchuriki.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.370
For now…

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.950
See… He's right over there.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.870
That boy is the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki… His name is Naruto Uzumaki.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.660
Uzumaki?

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.580
Of Mito's clan, eh?

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.990
He's the brat who attacked me earlier.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.620
But he's actually quite something.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.330
Capturing him is fine, but that one in front of us is a clone.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.910
Shall we go now to get the real one?

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.910
No. There's a jutsu I'd like to try out.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.830
I think it will make a prettier picture

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.700
if I do it where there are people around.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.410
It's them! At four o'clock!

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.160
Wood Style: Deep Forest Emergence!

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.490
He can do Wood Style?!

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.330
I guess this is it for us…

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.930
Damn it! I don't have much chakra left!

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.270
I'm at my limit!

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.810
I feel like I'm going to disappear at any moment!

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.180
What should I do?

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.270
Naruto…enough… We'll take over from here.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.310
I finally have a chance at reclaiming myself!

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.640
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Five Kage Assemble"

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.480
I will help you reclaim yourself.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.770
THE FIVE KAGE ASSEMBLE Tune in again!
