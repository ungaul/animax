WEBVTT

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.570
I'm beginning to lose my patience with these shinobi.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.400
How long do they intend to keep us feudal lords cooped up like this?

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.610
Now, now… What is the harm?

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.480
We should decorate them after the war.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.400
What shall we call it?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.230
Is this it?

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.400
How hard the wind blows

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.360
As we course through the deep and winding road

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.480
The smell of the wind reminds me of the capital…

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.400
Officials and we feudal lords are used as hostages in times of war.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.650
It is the duty of the shinobi to guarantee our safety.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.530
Which is why I accompany you, Lord of the Land of Mist.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.980
We will reach your hiding place shortly.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.400
Now then, what is a suitable title for the decoration?

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.400
Certificate of… Certificate of…

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.730
Is that the enemy?! I didn't detect anything!

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.570
Do not let them get close to the Feudal Lords!

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.320
He fell for it!

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.570
So, this wasn't it.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.690
Damn! He got away.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.690
Get word to the other hiding place! Stat!

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.900
Oh!

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.400
I have the perfect name for the honor!

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.570
Land of Fire's Hidden Leaf, Land of Wind's Hidden Sand,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.730
Land of Earth's Hidden Stone, Land of Water's Hidden Mist,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.690
Land of Lightning's Hidden Cloud Allied Shinobi Decoration!

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.400
It's too long!

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.190
The Allied Award will suffice!

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.780
No, that is much too short.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.030
It doesn't sound distinctive enough.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.030
Feudal lords are so carefree.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.730
What's the fuss over getting a decoration?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.570
That's their job.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.280
Don't knock it.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.480
If there weren't any medals and decorations,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.730
we wouldn't know what honor is.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.610
Someone has to set the standard.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.440
Well… I guess so.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.360
You don't get decorated by just thinking about it!

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.230
Stay alert. It's almost time to move.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.530
Feudal Lord of the Land of Frost…

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.190
We are now headed for the fifth hiding place.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.530
Fifth?

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.530
Yes…

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.730
We will be moving you at fixed intervals to five locations

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.940
to prevent the enemy from finding you.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.320
Your bodyguards are all skilled shinobi too.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.230
That is reassuring.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.780
Yes…

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.480
They've underestimated me, Black Zetsu!

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.820
This land is me!

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.360
Battleground

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.730
It's drab…

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.230
But I'll show them why I'm the one guarding the coastline.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.610
I'll launch the opening shot! Then continue!

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.320
– Yes sir! – Yes sir!

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.940
Lightning Style, Black Panther!

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.280
Black Lightning!

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.440
Captain Darui is the only one authorized

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.150
by the previous Raikage to get a lightning tattoo!

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.070
Sorry about that.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.360
Up above!

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.480
We're not going to allow you to pass so easily!

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.570
Keep on going!

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.230
Don't let them break through the barricade!

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.400
Now go!

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.610
My worst nightmare has come true.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.110
This is like… No, this is the Great Ninja War.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.440
Choza…

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.230
What?

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.400
I see…

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.440
You're all grown up, Choza.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.730
I have still have a lot to grow.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.610
Release!

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.360
Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.400
Brother…

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.650
Forgive me…

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.110
As a member of the branch family, who should be protecting the main family,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.530
I'm standing here now as your enemy.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.400
This must be my punishment for resenting the main family long ago.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.480
My body will not do what I tell it to.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.400
As it is, my decision to choose death

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.730
for the sake of the village has been negated…

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.360
So please tell Neji.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.940
I wasn't killed to protect the head family.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.150
But to protect Neji, my siblings, family and the land,

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.980
by my own will, I chose death!

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.530
This is the fate in store for me,

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.440
a member of the branch family.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.150
There is no such fate!

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.150
Your son has fought to demonstrate that!

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.480
So has my daughter!

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.030
Neji… And Lady Hinata too…

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.030
Damn, there's no end to this!

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.280
Are you all right, Neji?!

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.530
Yeah… Thanks, Hinata.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.320
It's not about the branch family protecting

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.980
the bloodline of the main family now.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.360
We protect each other as comrades!

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.150
That time has actually come to pass?

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.190
Then Brother…

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.400
This is all the more reason, by your hand I wish to…

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.170
Even wild geese know about formation.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.830
That when the leader becomes confused,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.330
the entire flock is put at risk.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.960
But I am much too young,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.710
too inexperienced to protect this world!

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.460
So I beg you all to lend me your strength!

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.080
You got it, Lord Gaara!

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.330
Although it's a fact that someone young and charismatic

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.630
must stand at the helm…

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.460
Hey!

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.710
All this moving around is making me sick!

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.290
Talk about being artless, hmm!

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.170
Shut up.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.040
I'll be happy to seal that mouth shut too.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.420
I'm not into S&amp;M!

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.670
I'll show you what real art is, so let me outta here, hmm!

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.790
Damn it…

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.000
Ouch!

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.540
We stopped…hmm.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.630
Granny Chiyo…

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.500
And…

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.790
Well done, Kankuro.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.880
You seem to have stopped Sasori.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.790
Hmm? That voice…

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.710
Hey! If you're here to help, get me out of here!

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.580
It's stifling me and I'm about to explode, hmm!

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.580
No, you're wrong.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.290
You can't explode, that's the reason you're in there…

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.420
Explosive Style kid.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.630
Oh…well, that's true.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.580
Hey, don't put it like that, hmm!

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:36.380
Both the Akatsuki and the shinobi of the Five Great Nations are enemies to me.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.170
I have no intention of helping you.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.250
I loathe this jutsu.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.670
I have no control over my body.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.250
The Reanimation Jutsu again…

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.960
As if Granny Chiyo isn't dangerous enough,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.080
these guys look pretty scary too.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.420
It doesn't help that we split up our fighting force.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.670
Listen up.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.580
Retreat on my signal.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:08.920
Right.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.460
We just got tactical orders from Headquarters.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.540
We're to transmit this to the front immediately!

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.710
Get the tactical data to the captains!

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.250
Captain Kitsuchi!

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.500
This just came in from Headquarters! Tactical orders!

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.960
All right! Tell me!

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.580
Got it.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.080
Sorry, I just got orders to take half this company

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.330
and join up with the First Company.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.580
Half?!

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.540
Are they out of their minds at Headquarters?!

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.790
No, I agree with their strategy.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.830
If everything goes according to plan, things will be okay.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.920
And I'll be back.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.170
But one thing troubles me.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.380
What's the matter, Shikamaru?

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.540
Supposedly, the enemy has a Kekkei Touta shinobi

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.710
that surpasses Kekkei Genkai.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.580
Kekkei Touta?! Are you sure about this?

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.710
Kekkei Touta?

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.170
What are they talking about?

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.630
Do you know, Matsuri?

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.000
I've never heard of it.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.670
But judging from Temari's shocked reaction…

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.380
It must be a formidable enemy.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.420
You there…

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.290
How do you expect to defend yourself

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.630
against the Kekkei Touta with so little knowledge?!

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.210
– F-Forgive me, Temari! – F-Forgive me, Temari!

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:03.000
But exactly what is Kekkei Touta?

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.380
Damn it, don't you young ones know anything?!

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.130
Kekkei Touta is…

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.540
Kekkei… Touta is…?

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.790
Shikamaru, tell them!

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.960
Huh? Why me?

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.670
I'm not good at these things!

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.670
You explain!

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.750
Damn it.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.960
I'm the one who's supposed to give the orders.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.500
I want to hear this too, Shikamaru.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:40.460
Well then, I guess I should start with the properties of chakra.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.960
FIRE WIND LIGHTNING EARTH WATER Generally, we all possess one chakra nature.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.170
EARTH FIRE WIND WATER LIGHTNING That's besides the nature you obtain from training.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.540
WATER LIGHTNING EARTH WIND FIRE There are different natures,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.710
so the more chakra natures you have, the better.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.500
WATER WIND EARTH FIRE WIND LIGHTNING FIRE EARTH WATER WIND That's why most jonin possess multiple chakra natures.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:03.630
I see…

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.170
I know that much.

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.580
You'd better.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:13.500
However, there are those born with two chakra natures,

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:19.710
who are able to fuse the two and create new chakra.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.250
They are known as Kekkei Genkai shinobi.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.500
Captain Yamato's Wood Style is a combination of water and earth.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.750
Isn't that right?

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.670
Yes.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.500
And Captain Darui of the First Company uses a Gale Style

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.500
that's a combination of lightning and water chakra.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.380
They're all shinobi with rare jutsu styles.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:50.380
And topping the Kekkai Genkai, there is the Kekkei Touta

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.210
in which three chakra natures are fused.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.960
What?! Three?

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.040
It's almost beyond belief and extremely rare.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.000
In fact, I know of only one

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.130
among all the shinobi of the Five Great Nations.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.710
Of all the luck, the enemy uses the Reanimation Jutsu…

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.790
And they've resurrected a long-dead Kekkei Touta shinobi

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.630
who uses something known as the Particle Style.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.500
Mu the Second Tsuchikage.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.040
We'd better come up with a strategy against him.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.630
Shikamaru…

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:30.710
How can we leave when there's such a formidable enemy shinobi?

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.460
Well, it looks like Headquarters has taken that into consideration.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:42.670
With the appearance of a rare ally with a Kekkei Touta.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.880
You didn't have to bother stepping up to help.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.250
And who was it that didn't stop me?

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.170
Then let me ask you this.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.170
When did you all forsake yourselves?

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.580
This is where I take back my forsaken self!!

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.580
Super-Expansion Jutsu!

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.830
This is pitiful…

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.420
That we're caught in the jutsu of the Second Hokage

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.710
whom we've beaten before… eh, Kinkaku?

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.960
My apologies for embarrassing you, Kinkaku and Ginkaku,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.040
long revered as the shining light of the Cloud.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.710
Ginkaku, look at his left shoulder.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.710
It's the kid who inherited the Third Raikage's lightning.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.580
He seems to have some skill.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.750
I don't mean to disrespect you,

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.420
but I'll have to shame you some more.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.250
I may end up taking the shine out of your silver and gold…

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.670
With one strike of my Gale Style!

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.670
Even though this is drab.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.390
I don't like that tone you're using toward your seniors.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.100
I'll shut you up!

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.770
Seems like a lot of time has passed.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:50.600
No one knows about us anymore. Let's do this Ginkaku!

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.310
All right, Kinkaku!

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.600
So those are the Gold and Silver Brother's Ninja Tools!

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.390
