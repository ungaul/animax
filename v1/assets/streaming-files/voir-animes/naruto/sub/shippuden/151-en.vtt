WEBVTT

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.970
By the way, Kakashi Sensei, who's that on your back?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.170
She's one of Sasuke's comrades.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.770
Not anymore.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.170
I have a lot of questions I want to ask her,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.370
so I'm taking her back to the village.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.800
I see. So we're going back to Hidden Leaf Village.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.130
Naruto, not that way.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.930
What're you saying, Kakashi Sensei?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.630
Hidden Leaf Village is this way.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.930
We forgot something in the Land of Iron.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.600
Right, Sakura?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.470
Forgot something…

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.070
Oh!

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.970
We should go back and retrieve it, right?

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.400
Yes.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.930
Hmm? What is it?

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.770
I feel awful!

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.070
What are you doing here?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.830
You were supposed to go back to the village with me.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.930
You even made a hole in the floor of the inn!

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.030
Naruto… Let's get going soon.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.070
Naruto…

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.630
Damn it!

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.470
Why?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.070
That was a clone just now!

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.530
I-I'm so sorry!

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.070
I had to pursue you, and I was barely able to apologize to the innkeepers!

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.270
Naruto came in the nick of time, but it seems you didn't send him over.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.270
Of course not! After all, you told me to take Naruto back to the village.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.030
In essence, Naruto left you behind.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.600
No, well…

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.470
It turned out fine, Yamato.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.900
If Naruto hadn't come, Sakura might have been dead now.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.970
And maybe even me, depending on the circumstances.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.700
Sasuke's chakra was different from the past.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.820
It was dark and cold.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.200
Still…

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.820
Sasuke is Sasuke.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.900
You're right.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.530
Sasuke is Sasuke.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.430
Yeah.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.800
Anyway, that's what happened, Yamato.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.570
So please forgive Naruto.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.070
I understand.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.700
Release!

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.100
Ok. Please go on ahead.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.070
What about you?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.030
I'm going back to the inn to repair the hole Naruto made.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.630
Sorry, Captain Yamato.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.430
Honestly…

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.530
Let's get going too.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.230
Sasuke abandoned me.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.000
And now, I'm the Hidden Leaf's prisoner of war.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.970
I wonder how Suigetsu and Jugo are doing.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.570
Whatever… Like I care anymore.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.900
THE INFILTRATOR

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.070
Danzo should have returned some time ago.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.270
How do you intend to explain

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.500
the unfortunate outcome of the Five Kage Summit?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.430
May I enter?

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.700
What is it, Shikaku?

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.200
There's been an unusual disturbance among the members of the Foundation.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.500
Disturbance? Within the Foundation?

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.870
They seem restless. But I don't know the reason.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.330
Lord Homura, Lady Koharu…

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.230
Speak of the devil.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.570
Has there been any word from Lord Danzo?

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.970
No.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.900
We are waiting for him to return too.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.470
They are restless indeed.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.800
The higher-ups don't know anything either.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.430
Then Sai! He headed for the Land of Iron too.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.570
Find Sai. Have him report everything that's happened.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.970
We're home!

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.130
– Lord Bee! – Lord Bee!

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.370
Yo! Long time no see, Omoi, Karui!

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.770
Have ya been getting by cheerfully, care-free-ly? Merrily?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.500
Of course not!

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.500
Not after you suddenly disappeared from the village like that.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.300
Do you know how worried we were?!

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.800
Now, now! He was safe all this time, so it's all okay now!

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.600
Lord Raikage, welcome home.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.170
I know it's sudden, but we wish to hold a council right away

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.300
regarding what transpired at the Five Kage Summit Conference.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.700
What? No down time?

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.700
We can't afford to take it easy.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.170
Things are about to get even hotter.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.830
Why is that?

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.830
The Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:59.530
Huh?

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.000
An Allied Shinobi Force has been formed.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.670
Tell them the details at the meeting.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.900
Also, we'll need to meet with the Feudal Lord.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.300
I have requested an audience with him.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.530
Huh?

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.130
What's that?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.000
Just a spoil of war from my battle against one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.800
It's taken a liking to me. It won't leave my side.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.030
Wow, so this is one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men's blades, huh?

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.270
Unbelievable! As expected of you Lord Bee!

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.400
As expected, eh?

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.530
Even "as expected" me is at someone's mercy.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.270
Well? Did you record the battle?

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.030
Yeah.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.430
What about Samehada?

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.700
The Eight-Tails took it.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.270
I see. Then… Yeah.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.030
It went perfectly.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.700
You've got to hand it to Kisame.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.430
I will declare the start of

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.530
the Fourth Great Ninja War at the Five Kage Summit.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.100
So the time is now ripe.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.900
Once I've declared war,

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.870
I suspect the Eight-Tails' freedom will be restricted and he'll be confined.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.500
Then you can hunt him at your own leisure.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.370
I'm ready anytime, but…

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.200
First, we infiltrate.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.130
We sneak into their midst and obtain intel.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.730
So this is an infiltration mission?

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.200
Use White Zetsu.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:01.770
Once he makes contact, he can copy a person's chakra and create a clone.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.070
Leave it to me.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.500
However, he's weak.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.800
You can't use him in battle, but he's good for deception.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.900
If fighting the Eight-Tails gets too exciting,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.500
I might end up almost killing him, but I accept!

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:18.530
All right.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.030
I'll leave the Eight-Tails in your hands.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.770
Leave it to me.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.670
I searched high and low for you, Eight-Tails.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.470
My great blade Samehada loves powerful chakra.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.230
And it seems to have finally caught scent of some delicious chakra.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.570
I'm sorry, but you're going to be food for my Samehada.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.900
Not to worry though, I won't kill you.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.100
Now then, this is where things start getting tough.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.430
It was good to let Samehada take a liking to the Eight-Tails.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.730
I never imagined it would even share chakra with him.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.130
Though that ended up working in my favor.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.500
Their Sensory-Type Ninja hasn't caught on yet.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.970
It's not surprising.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.730
Since Samehada takes in Kisame's chakra and uses it for energy,

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.930
they have the same chakra signature.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.430
The enemy doesn't know any better.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.570
I could take on the infiltration mission.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.570
You are weak.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.770
Ultimately, we are going to capture the Eight-Tails.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.970
Kisame is the suitable one.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.030
But you pulled off that performance quite well.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.430
It wasn't easy switching places with Kisame underwater.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:39.870
I'm not used to it.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.930
Don't you think you're overdoing it?

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.070
It was just right for the Eight-Tails.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.470
I guess it's my turn now.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.070
I leave it in your hands.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.570
Water Style: Super Shark Bomb—

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.770
– Double Lariat! – Double Lariat!

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.830
I can undo my Body Substitution Jutsu now, right?

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.170
Yeah.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.800
It's almost feeding time. Let's merge.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.070
Is this is what you forgot?

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.030
How could these guys just lay around sleeping

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.030
while you were in such a bind, Sakura?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.470
Sakura!

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.330
They were going to help you.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.930
Apologize properly after you wake them up.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.070
I will.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200
You're going to wake them up?

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.030
Damn it.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.430
Naruto… It's my fault that they're asleep.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.370
So be gentle when you wake them.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.370
I feel sick.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.770
You're going to sleep too?

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.170
Naruto's like that because of you… umm, Sakura, right?

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.100
It's because of your poison.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.470
What a carefree guy. He's already asleep.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.400
He's sleeping so soundly.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.800
I think a burden's been lifted off of him.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.030
However, we don't have time to waste.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.870
Sakura, wake them up.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.500
H-Huh? Sakura?

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.070
Next up, Sai.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.970
I'm up. The drug has worn off.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.570
I'm sorry.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.370
Huh? How come Naruto's here?!

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.730
And he's fast asleep too!

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.400
I'll explain on the way home.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.930
Hey, get up!

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.500
Oh Kiba… Gently! Gently please!

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.300
But…why?

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:09.870
Do you still feel nauseous?

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.000
No. But can you take a look?

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.100
Looks fine to me.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.000
Then the Curse Mark is gone?

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.030
Lord Danzo had placed a Curse Mark on my tongue.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.930
Danzo is the new Hokage, right?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.100
Although he hasn't officially taken office yet.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.870
What about him?

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.800
The fact that the Curse Mark is gone means…

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.200
It seems like it.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.470
I can't believe it.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.030
Lord Danzo?

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.870
This girl knows more about it.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.400
This Danzo you're talking about…

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.830
Sasuke got him.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.130
Sasuke?!

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.470
Do you mean that Sasuke killed him?

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.600
Why?! He was the Hokage!

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.630
That's all I have to say.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.470
Tell us in detail!

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:08.430
What's going on?! I don't get it at all!

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.070
Make it an extra large.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.500
– You get up too and explain! – Now, now, Kiba.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.530
Wake up, Naruto!

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.200
All right! Next up is the meeting with the Feudal Lord!

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.730
He is already waiting for you.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.230
All right! Don't waste any time, everyone!

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.070
Especially you, Bee!

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.870
What is it, Brother?

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.130
You understand, don't you?

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:43.130
Sure I do! I really do understand. Yay.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.100
Things have gotten really bad.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.930
I know. A Great Ninja War they say.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.630
In other words, just an all-out war.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:59.170
So newbies like us, who have no experience in a real war,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.100
are gonna be sent to the frontlines.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.430
And we'll be surrounded by this Akatsuki troop

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.270
that no one knows much about… and it'll mean certain death for us.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.030
But we have no choice but to give it our all, so I'll fight hard.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.200
But the enemy's counterattack will be relentless and I'll end up crying.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.670
And Karui, if you die…

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.870
So you're killing me off, you jerk?!

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.830
Yo, don't despair young ones. Yay!

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:28.270
Lord Bee… I'll put your troubled hearts at ease, baby.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.000
With my sentimental rap.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.170
Sentimental?

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.530
Damn it, this is ridiculous!

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.400
We listened to her wishes and even located Sasuke for her.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.830
Now don't be so upset, Kiba.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.270
Don't act like you're the only hero here, Sakura.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.000
You told us to keep this a secret from Naruto,

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:55.730
but Sai went and blabbed it all to him, on top of which, Sasuke got away.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.070
Kiba!

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.370
Be a man and quit complaining.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.600
Speak for yourself, Naruto!

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.730
Huh? Me?

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.670
Oh, you're right about that!

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.900
You are too simple and dumb

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.430
to be able to think as complexly as you've been attempting.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.370
Hey Sai!

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.600
Since when did you develop such a carefree laugh? Huh?

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.770
Thank you.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.270
That wasn't a compliment!

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.370
What is it, Bushy Brow?

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.400
It's like you're back to your old self, Naruto.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.570
He means you haven't grown at all.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.270
Once an idiot, always an idiot.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.130
Kiba, you're the idiot! Idiot!

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.200
I don't wanna hear that coming from an idiot!

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.730
I've had enough of your smiling face!

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.200
This guy is the complete opposite of Sasuke.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:49.330
His chakra is…so… bright and warm.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.370
What is this?

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.970
Deep inside him… A chakra like this? So dark!

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.200
As though…

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.370
Sai, you need to explain everything that's happened.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.200
Who are these guys?

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.330
Members of the Foundation, from the Anbu Black Ops.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.800
It seems you are aware of it too.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.770
The reason why the Curse Mark placed on us by Lord Danzo is gone.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.470
Is Lord Danzo…dead?

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:22.500
Yes.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.630
That's…

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.670
What about his bodyguards, Foo and Torune?

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.330
I'm in the dark about them too.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.900
They were not at the site.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.630
Therefore, I would like to propose a discussion

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.370
about the future of the Foundation with you.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.470
And with the new Hokage here… New Hokage?

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.600
Kakashi Hatake.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.300
Huh?!

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.330
We'll head back ahead of you.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.030
You're going to be the next Hokage, Kakashi Sensei?

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.770
Looks like it's going to be that way.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.970
I'll get right to the point.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.730
The Five Great Nations of the Hidden Cloud, Hidden Leaf,

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.830
Hidden Stone, Hidden Mist, and the Hidden Sand

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:20.130
along with samurai of the Land of Iron have formed the Allied Shinobi Forces.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.430
Therefore, I ask for your approval.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.230
Why such haste, Raikage?

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.830
Rivalries exist among the shinobi.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.330
And now, you are pooling your strength to form a military alliance?

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.000
For what reason?

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.870
The Tailed Beasts.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.230
Tailed Beasts?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.470
A group known as the Akatsuki has taken possession of

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.270
seven of the Tailed Beasts and has declared war on us.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.470
The Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.730
Continue.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.130
The remaining Tailed Beasts are

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.230
the Hidden Leaf's Nine-Tails and our own Eight-Tails.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.670
We have no choice but to cooperate.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:02.730
This is not a case of the retainer wanting to replace his lord, is it, Raikage?

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:07.300
We don't even know if we will be able to protect the Feudal Lords.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.830
That's how difficult this battle will be.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.370
I understand, Raikage.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.470
I approve your alliance.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.330
Then I request that you convene a Feudal Lord Summit.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.300
A Feudal Lord Summit?

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.530
Do you know how difficult that is to arrange?

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.300
Please arrange it.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.200
I guess I have no choice.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.370
I will do as you say.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:41.770
Thank you!

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.500
We have approval from the Feudal Lord.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.630
Now we can officially prepare for war.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.370
Yes. I will begin all phases of preparations.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.170
I hope the other villages will start preparing right away.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.430
I don't know about the Hidden Leaf.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.930
Looks like they have Hokage succession issues.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.300
The Sand too. Their Kazekage is young and knows nothing of war.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:07.970
Never mind the others.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.170
Make haste and prepare for an all-out battle!

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.230
What is that?

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.500
I'm not sure.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.270
Yay!

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.570
– Yay! – Yay!

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.370
Yo young ones!

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.830
Blast your worries away, knock 'em out of sight.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:31.000
My rap song is filled with passion, baby.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.230
– Yay! – Yay!

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.300
Now listen to me.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.900
Master Kin polished my style and added more passion.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.400
It's a new enka rap!

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.730
It's called "Gosaku"!

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.430
So thank you!

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:44.470
– Yay! – Yay!

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.100
Yay!

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.200
Drop Kick!

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.700
You haven't learned a thing, have you?

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:02.300
Big Bro, your kick is really effective. Not again!

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.470
It's certain that the Akatsuki is strong.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.600
But the true strength of our Allied Shinobi Forces,

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.870
which is unparalleled in history, is an unknown.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.000
If we unite all the shinobi's power

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.670
I believe we can counter them thoroughly.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.770
Above all, we must win this battle or the world will end.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.500
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Five Great Nations Mobilize."

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.900
From this point forward, begin the preparations for the Great War!

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.230
Tune in again!
