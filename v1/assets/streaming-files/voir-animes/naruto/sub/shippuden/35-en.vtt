WEBVTT

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.130
That was fast...

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.470
I heard it was a matter of urgency...

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.700
I want you to take Kakashi's place.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.200
It's an honor to be able to work in Kakashi Senpai's stead...

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.330
This isn't an Anbu Black Ops mission.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.370
It will be a regular mission.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.900
Therefore, take off that mask and I will give you a codename.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.330
During this mission, you'll be known as "Yamato."

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.500
I understand.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.830
An additional member... a new recruit from the Anbu Black Ops Training Division

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.430
will be dispatched to Team Kakashi.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.300
From...The Foundation?

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.770
However...

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.030
What is it?

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.830
Keep a close watch on his actions.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.100
Naruto, do you know him?

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.930
Yeah...

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.230
He's the guy who attacked me earlier

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.870
when I was with Shikamaru and the others!

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.330
Stop it, Naruto!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.970
Come to think of it, who're you, mister?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400
Oh...could it be...?

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.230
I'm the replacement captain for this team

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.970
while Kakashi is in the hospital.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.230
Call me Yamato.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.900
Captain...Yamato...

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.630
You're comrades on the same team, so you guys need to get along.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.330
C-Comrade...? This guy?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.200
Sorry about before.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.330
Since we're going to be teammates from now on,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.530
I just wanted to find out how strong you were.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.900
You didn't have to go through the trouble of doing that...

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.730
But thanks to that,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.630
I now know you're a worthless guy with questionable "equipment."

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.700
Hey, what did you say?!

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.430
- We're going to be teammates! - Damn you!

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.530
- Don't start fighting right at the start! - Some things are inexcusable!

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.170
But you're kind of a rotten guy, aren't you...?

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.000
Is that so?

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.530
People won't like you if you say stuff like that.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.070
I like nice...ugly women like you.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.130
Ugly...

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.530
Hey, what did you say?!

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.600
- Try repeating that, you twerp. - Hey, do you remember...

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.130
- Don't try being cocky with me, cha! - ...what you just said to Naruto?!

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.170
Oh, don't you look silly.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.400
Master Jiraiya.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.430
Well, I guess you always looked like that...

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.700
I heard you'll be in bed...

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.130
HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL for a week, huh?

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.800
Well, it seems so...

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.030
Hey, don't force yourself.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.730
It doesn't look like you'll be able to move for awhile...

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.400
It's a get-well gift.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.630
Both volumes of the deluxe edition of "Make-Out Paradise."

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.270
You may have already read it several times,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.330
but it should at least help pass the time.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.200
Thanks...

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.100
Surely this isn't the only reason why you returned to the village.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.830
I'll give you the details once he... and Tsunade get here...

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.770
He? Who's that?

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.630
I think he's calling himself Yamato on this mission...

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.070
An Unnecessary Addition 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.700
At any rate, the four of us will be starting our mission now.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.870
And yet...

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.970
What's up with this?

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.030
I don't have time to put you all in a cage to get used to each other.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.600
Come on, introduce yourselves.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.570
Naruto Uzumaki.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.030
I'm Sakura Haruno.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.700
My name's Sai.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.430
Well, that's enough getting acquainted for now.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.200
I will now explain our mission as Team Kakashi.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.100
The four of us will now head for the Tenchi Bridge...

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.470
capture the Akatsuki spy who has infiltrated Orochimaru's organization...

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.030
and bring him back here.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.930
It's an opportunity for us to get information

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.130
on Orochimaru and Sasuke Uchiha.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.300
We will obtain a precious source of information

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.170
with which we can draw up plans for both the assassination of Orochimaru

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.100
and the retrieval of Sasuke.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.700
Be sure to proceed with caution!

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.470
Right!

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.570
Yes, sir!

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.530
We'll meet at the main gate in an hour!

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.800
We'll leave once you've equipped yourselves with your Ninja tools!

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.270
For crying out loud!

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.870
I don't like that Sai jerk at all!

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.030
Why's he taking the place of Sasuke?

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.600
Team Kakashi's fine with three people!

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.030
He does indeed have a foul mouth...

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.770
but don't you think he kind of resembles Sasuke?

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.570
Like his face and the way he talks...

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.100
He doesn't resemble Sasuke at all!

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.000
Sasuke's cooler... No, not cooler.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.230
Well, he's better!

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.370
Yeah. Sasuke's a little cooler than Sai, isn't he?

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.330
Not just a little! Sasuke's totally b-better!

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:29.900
Good move.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.930
Listen carefully... Never let your guard down.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.170
What is it... Senpai?

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.430
Listen carefully.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.900
The classified mission you've been given is Lord Danzo's...

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.200
A cat, huh...?

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.570
Anyway, Lord Danzo's vision...

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.770
for the future of the village rests upon this classified mission.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.630
Failure is not an option.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.270
I know.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.570
Good.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.930
You're still carrying that around with you...?

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.200
This is...

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.630
In The Foundation,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.670
...you have no name and no emotions.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.530
You have no past... and no future.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.670
There is only the mission...

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.430
Never forget the will of The Foundation,

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.700
which supports the giant tree known as the Leaf Village from underground...

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.900
unseen.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.600
I won't.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.130
Hidden Leaf Hospital

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.400
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.230
You're late.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.530
I got held up with this and that...

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.400
Very well...

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.570
Kakashi's waiting.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.030
Make-out Paradise Deluxe Edition

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.630
It looks like they're here...

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.670
We're coming in, Kakashi.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.370
Please come in.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.630
It's been a long time, Senpai!

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:25.600
You...

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.770
I see. So you're the one called Yamato, huh?

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.700
I get it...

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.530
Yes! As of today, I will be known as Yamato

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.000
while I work as the substitute captain of Team Kakashi.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.900
Yamato, huh?

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.670
I brought him here...

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.470
because there's something I'd really like him to know

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.700
since he'll be working as the captain of Team Kakashi.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.230
And that is...

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.500
the biggest reason why he was chosen as Kakashi's replacement.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.970
Is this about Naruto?

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.500
Exactly.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.030
You know that Naruto has the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit...

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.700
sealed inside him, right?

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:18.630
Yes, I do...

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.930
Sometimes the Nine-Tailed Chakra leaks out from inside Naruto's body...

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.400
and takes the form of the Fox Spirit.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.770
We call it the "Nine-Tail's Cloak."

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.900
The Nine-Tail's Cloak, huh...?

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.870
Does it happen often?

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.930
It happened on our previous mission.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.070
When his emotions intensified,

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.300
the Nine-Tailed Chakra started to leak out...

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.630
it engulfed his body and became the Nine-Tail's Cloak.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.470
Just before the second tail formed...

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.730
I somehow managed to suppress the Chakra

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.530
with the tag I received from Master Jiraiya...

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.270
But who knows what would've happened

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.100
if things had been left as they were...

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.400
I see... So it appeared just as I thought...

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.330
Judging from the shape of the Chakra,

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.170
the number of tails will probably continue to grow...

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.270
and eventually...

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.100
there will be nine.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.330
That's about the size of it...

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.070
Master Jiraiya, how many tails have you seen...?

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.430
I've come close to dying twice in my lifetime...

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.400
The first time, I broke six ribs and both arms,

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.230
and several of my internal organs ruptured...

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.970
It was when I was trying to peek into the women's bath at a hot spring...

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.370
and you pounded me good, Tsunade.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.270
The other time was...

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.230
during Naruto's training

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.300
when I saw the fourth tail of the Nine-Tailed Chakra.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.670
I'm off!

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.630
Master!

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:15.730
Oh...

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:18.470
What is it?

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.700
You should still have some time left before you're to assemble.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.770
I wanted to have a few words before we leave.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.070
I see. Then your timing is perfect.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.630
There's something I wanted to ask you.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.300
What is it?

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.630
It's about Sai.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.830
I see...

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.200
So it's already going badly, huh...?

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:47.630
Yes...

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.370
It can't be helped...

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.170
For the time being, you keep Naruto under control.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.600
I'll do what I can, but...

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.900
Come in!

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.570
Who's that?

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.330
Danzo, huh...? What is it?

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.000
Did you place a skilled Anbu Black Ops member

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:34.530
as the captain of Sai's unit, Princess Tsunade?

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.900
I selected the best man I have.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.870
He's worked since the Third Hokage's tenure.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.000
Very well...

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.100
But I just hope...

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.770
he hasn't been tainted by the teachings of the Third Hokage.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.100
The teachings of the gutless Third Hokage

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.370
who disliked matters of conflict...

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.630
Just like how the teachings of your grandfather...

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.570
tainted the Third Hokage...

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.970
I guess I'm more or less relieved.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.100
Now I can enjoy my meals without worries.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.430
Excuse me.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.970
Who the heck...was that?

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.270
A long time ago...

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.400
he competed with the late Sarutobi Sensei

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.600
over the position of the Third Hokage.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.230
Unlike the Third Hokage,

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.870
he's the leader of a hard-line military faction based on rigid logic...

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.700
and is Sai's superior.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.270
He hates me because I'm the granddaughter of the First Hokage

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.470
as well as a student of the Third Hokage who was a moderate.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.200
Umm...

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.500
Isn't it about time...?

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.700
Oh!

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.430
That's right. Isn't it almost time, Sakura?

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:28.300
Yes, it is...

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.870
I'll be going now.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:32.800
Right!

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.430
If we succeed in this mission, we can get one step closer to Sasuke...

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.330
All right!

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.470
I'm off!

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.800
Okay...

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.770
Team Kakashi, will now set out.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.800
How long are you guys going to argue?

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.300
If this keeps up,

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.970
it will surely affect the way we carry out our mission.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.630
So here's a suggestion from me.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.130
In order to build rapport as a team,

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.130
I can toss you guys into this cell for a full day,

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.570
or we can stay at a hot spring inn for a night. Which would you guys prefer?

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.530
I prefer the kind and gentle approach...

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.800
but I'm not against using fear to control you guys either when necessary.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.230
