WEBVTT

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.430
I worked it into the seal spell

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.600
so that I would appear within your psyche,

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.930
should the seal be broken to the point you sprouted the eighth tail.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.400
I really wanted to avoid that...

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.270
Since I had no desire to see you again...Nine-Tails.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.270
Then again...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.200
I did look forward to seeing my son as a young man.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.330
So I'll call it even.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.830
Fourth Hokage!

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.570
Come here! I'll rip you to shreds!

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.900
Well, if that's the case, I'll stay away.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.430
Right, Naruto?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.030
Naruto... My name...

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.570
How come the Fourth Hokage knows my name?

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.100
Hm?

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.630
Well...I'm the one who named you.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.300
You are my son, after all.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.630
Son? Then...I'm...

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.270
Yes.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.600
You heard me. You're my son.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.900
Fourth Hokage!

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.070
Loud fellow, isn't he?

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.270
Let's go somewhere quiet.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.370
Third Hokage didn't tell you much of anything, did he?

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.570
I guess he wanted to suppress as much information about Nine-Tails as possible.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.130
If people had found out you were my son,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.130
you'd have been in danger.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.230
Dad...

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.730
Why did you seal the Nine-Tails inside your own son?!

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.900
Do you know what I went through because of that?!

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.370
All the grown-ups looked at me with contempt...

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.470
And I couldn't make any friends.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.230
I wanted people to accept me,

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.470
so I trained really hard to become strong.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.400
Then I met Iruka Sensei, and Kakashi Sensei, and Pervy Sage...

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.770
And I was happy because they helped make me stronger!

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.530
But because of that, a group called the Akatsuki came after me,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.500
so I had to train even more.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.930
I got to be even stronger, but the Akatsuki still killed my friends.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.730
But...huh? What am I saying?

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.270
Damn it, am I supposed to be happy or mad?!

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.030
I don't know anymore!

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.200
Naruto... How old are you now?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.430
Sixteen.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.770
Wow... You're already sixteen years old, huh?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.230
It must have been hard for you... I'm sorry, Naruto.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.630
I suppose after putting my own son through so much...

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.000
I have no right to act like a father and apologize.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.530
It's all right...already.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.130
I'm the son...of the Fourth Hokage... so I can handle it.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.900
I sealed half of the Nine-Tails' chakra inside of you,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.670
because I believed you could control its power.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.500
Because you are my son.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.830
And there is a reason why I did this.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.300
When the Nine-Tails attacked the village sixteen years ago,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.770
I learned something.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.270
What?

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.530
There was a mastermind who manipulated the Nine-Tails

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.900
to attack the village.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.230
Mastermind?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.570
A powerful ninja at that.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.370
It would require a special kind of power to go up against such an opponent.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.130
I believe he will attack our village again.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.130
The Leaf Village has already been destroyed.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.830
Yes... I watched from inside you.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.930
You watched?!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.530
I know about Jiraiya Sensei too.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.930
Then was it Pain who used the Nine-Tails to attack the village before?

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.630
No... It wasn't him.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.970
Then who was it?!

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.600
One of the Akatsuki.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.500
The one with the mask.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.000
Back then... he read through every action I took.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.070
He's no ordinary ninja.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.970
This man is probably just using Pain.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.630
No! Pain had a grudge against the Hidden Leaf!

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.870
He said, long ago, his own village was wiped out like ours!

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.730
That's right.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.030
Because of that hatred, he's being used.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.800
Used?! Someone strong like him?!

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.670
And what about this mastermind masked ninja?

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.500
Why is everyone attacking the Leaf?

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.570
Perhaps as long as there is a ninja system in this world,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.870
there can be no peace.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.600
Pain questioned you about peace...

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.100
But finding the answer is difficult.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.600
How would you confront this hatred, in order to create peace?

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.530
In order to save something dear... wars are waged.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.600
As long as there is love, there will be hate.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.230
And some will take advantage of that hatred.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.830
This monster known as hate will not die while there is a system of ninja.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.570
It will give birth to more Pains.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.800
It was Pain who killed Jiraiya Sensei,

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.130
but upon careful thought, it can be said

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.300
that the chaotic world of the ninja, which gave rise to Pain, is equally guilty.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.800
To be a ninja is to confront hatred.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.200
Each and every one of us battles hatred.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.500
Jiraiya Sensei trusted you to find a way to end this hatred.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.430
Still, I can't forgive Pain!

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.370
There's no way I can forgive him.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.830
I know...

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.500
Fourth Hokage... Tell me!

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.700
What should I do?!

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.000
FOURTH HOKAGE You must find the answer yourself.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.330
I do not have the answer.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.570
If Pervy Sage and you don't know the answer, how am I to know?!

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.170
Everyone expects too much!

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.670
I'm not smart!

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.800
And I'm not a great ninja!

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.900
And...

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.200
I know you'll find the answer.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.930
I have faith in you.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.270
Really?

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.600
You really believe I can do it?

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.630
To be a parent is to have undying faith in one's child.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.800
Now then... It's time for me to go.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.730
My chakra's fading.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:57.900
Huh?!

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.600
No, wait...

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.170
I will rebuild the seal.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.200
However, this will be for the last time.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.770
The Leaf can be rebuilt.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.200
I'm counting on you...Naruto!

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.630
Thanks...Dad!

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:54.010
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:59.100
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:05.520
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.440
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:16.240
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.540
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.750
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.380
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:35.010
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:35.010
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:42.180
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:50.400
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.900
koete Someday...

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.430
Fourth Hokage

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.870
He is crawling out of the Planetary Devastation.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.500
What incredible strength.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.830
I must increase the size...

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.900
The Nine-Tails...disappeared?!

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.930
His doubt is gone...

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.070
What happened?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.100
Does he now have control over the Nine-Tails?

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.500
Nagato!

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.670
The transformation into the Nine-Tails disturbed my chakra.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.970
It made me lose my Shadow Clone.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.530
I can only use the Sage Jutsu Chakra I have left inside of me.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.200
He's already in Sage Mode.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.170
He's tough.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.500
I had to confirm the extent of the Nine-Tails' power,

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.330
but I never imagined he could stop my Planetary Devastation.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.530
I thought I was going to die!

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.630
What the...?

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.600
That's where the village is...

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.870
What happened?

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.270
You did it, Naruto, when you were in the Nine-Tails state.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.470
I killed Hinata, and the people of the Leaf Village?!

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.430
She's alive...

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.100
I can sense Hinata's chakra.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.230
I was worried,

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.530
but no casualties resulted from your assault

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.030
in the Nine-Tails state.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.200
We were lucky.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.700
I see.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.530
Thank goodness. What a relief.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.030
Naruto...

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.170
Lady Hinata!

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.070
Her injuries aren't fatal, but she needs treatment immediately!

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.400
I'll find some Medical Ninja right away.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.800
The Leaf Village is under attack by the Akatsuki!

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.870
I cannot move anymore! Hurry and go!

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.700
I didn't know things were this bad.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.900
There's an injured toad here too.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.830
It's time to settle this.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.600
Have you come to understand a little of what pain is?

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.630
Unless you know the same pain, you cannot truly know another.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.830
And even if you get to know others, there can be no understanding.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.430
That is the truth.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.370
Just like how it's useless to chase after Sasuke.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.570
Take me to where the real Pain is!

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.000
I want to speak to you face-to-face.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.300
Take me to where the real Pain is!

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.130
I want to speak to you face-to-face.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.700
Hmm... So you figured that out?

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.730
Jiraiya Sensei and now you...

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.200
You Leaf Ninja are quite impressive.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.530
However, our discussion is over.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.000
Talking with you will change nothing.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.900
Let me talk to him!

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.100
Sage Mode...

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.630
It seems you can only throw two of those nasty chakra shuriken.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.970
Isn't that so?

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.270
After that, you will run out of Sage Mode!

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.370
I guess I have no choice but to fight you!

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.300
If both of your shuriken miss, you shall lose.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.330
I will give you no more chances.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.200
All that's left is to dodge your attack, and then bring your half-dead body with me.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.630
Too bad then...

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.230
I'll just look for the real Pain myself!

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.070
But how?

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.400
I have an idea.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.100
He reverse-tracked me using Sage Mode!

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.230
Found you!

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:44.630
Bastard!

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.700
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.500
Now! Smoke Bombs!

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.970
Right!

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.300
Here comes the first shuriken.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.230
Almighty Push!

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.730
What?! He had already launched the second one using Shadow Shuriken Jutsu?!

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.500
His jutsu interval is five seconds!

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.030
I can do this!

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.500
Four seconds to go!

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.530
He was already standing by with a Shadow Clone back then.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.770
Three more seconds until I can use my next jutsu.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.330
But he missed both shots...

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.830
It's over.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.070
What?!

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:06.130
We still have two more seconds! Go!

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.670
He had this many Shadow Clones transformed into rubble?!

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.100
One more second!

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:25.870
Zero!

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.870
He's now using Shadow Clones as back up!

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.900
Someone like you who has no answer...

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.030
should just give up!

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.230
But I have faith that

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:02.430
there will come a time when people can truly understand one another.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:08.400
And if I can't find the answer, perhaps I will entrust you to find it.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.530
I know you'll find the answer.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.400
I have faith in you.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.930
Only you can surpass the Fourth Hokage.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.730
I truly believe that.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.530
He withstood it... Impossible!

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.370
That jutsu cannot be thrown.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:44.700
I have five seconds.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.070
This distance will work for me.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.430
Give up...

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.170
...on me giving up!

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.800
Rasengan!

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:16.350
When the fireworks suddenly explode in the air...
fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.850
I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face...
muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:31.070
sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly...

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:46.920
It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you...
kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:53.300
Because I always remember you, in situations like this...
kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto

00:20:53.660 --> 00:21:00.430
I can't help but think about the times we spent together.
mata omoidashiteshimau yo

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:09.900
I'm ready to forget you...
mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:14.030
It just tears at my heart too much.
konna ni mo kanashikute

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:21.200
I wonder... why did we meet each other?

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:24.960
doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes...

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:33.250
me wo tojireba It's like you are here.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:33.250
ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.300
You're here.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.770
That must mean you defeated the sixth Pain.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.070
It doesn't matter who won or lost.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.800
What happened?

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.930
In any case, I'm on my way to see the real Pain.

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.500
Please don't follow.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.200
I want to go alone.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.000
Alone?!

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.600
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Two Students"

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.970
There's something I want to confirm with him.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.130
GUY'S ROOM

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.170
Yamato's Room has been renamed Guy's Room!

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.000
Hello, this is your idol... Might Guy!

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.970
Our guest today is the pride of the Leaf Village,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.070
kunoichi Hinata Hyuga!

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.700
H-Hello.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.500
Aw come on. Don't be so bashful on my program.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.200
O-Oh umm... She is extremely introverted and shy.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.500
Her hobby is pressed flower art.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.200
She loves cinnamon rolls and sweet bean jam?

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.400
Forget the script!

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.530
I'll just ask you things I'm curious about.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.330
That's what a live, youthful interview is about!

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.300
Huh?!

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.470
By the way, Hinata...

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.230
You've really matured lately. Let me guess, you're in love, right?

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.770
- W-Well... - All right, then!

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.970
Look straight into that camera and say what's in your heart!

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.100
I-I can't... If you're too shy, I'll help you!

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.870
I-I... Let's do it... Okay, love confession in...

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.770
three, two, one, go!

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.530
I-I can't!

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.270
Tune in again!
