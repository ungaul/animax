00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.610
Why do you get up?!

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.360
There is no reason to keep on fighting for a world like this.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.400
In a few minutes, this world will be gone anyway.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.400
Why do you still fight?

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.730
Because it's my Ninja Way.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.070
I never go back on my word.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.570
That's my Ninja Way.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.690
I thought I told you to go to sleep!

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.110
Let's settle this with our next move, Naruto!

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.480
Right!

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.900
We'll sleep tomorrow, dreaming our own dreams!

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.440
A Heart Filled with Comrades

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.400
The Susano'o is...

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.820
That's...

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.230
I believe this is what Madara did once before.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.650
This is... Naruto and Sasuke?

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.400
Nothing you try now will change anything.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.940
Look above you...

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.900
What can you see through that hole at the top?

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.690
I can see what Obito sees...

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.820
and hear his voice.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.940
It's resonating.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.690
The moon.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.150
The time to enter the moonlit dream world nears.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.070
The gaping hole of hell that has opened will be filled

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.820
by the moon's dreams...

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.070
That time is finally here!

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.030
Look!

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.900
There's nothing in my heart!

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.530
I don't even feel pain anymore.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.400
Reality is cruel...

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.030
This hole will only keep growing larger.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.400
How will you fill this hole by staying in this world?

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.030
This sword is the divine blade of the Sage of the Six Paths...

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.570
the Nunoboko.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.190
You can no longer defeat me.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.440
Strong emotions dwell within the blade.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.190
It's a sword of the soul.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.190
The Sage created the world with this blade.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.570
Hey...did you feel that... just now?

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.070
Yeah...

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.610
Tenten, isn't this...?

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.480
Yeah. Let's go, Lee!

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.690
He's calling us.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.230
My desire will vanquish you all.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.530
No matter how much you resist, it's useless.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.980
The power of the Sage will stop you.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.780
Sasuke...

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.610
Let's focus everything on a single blow.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.150
I think we're only gonna have a tiny window to strike.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.610
Don't miss it.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.440
And I will use this sword to obliterate this world!

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.230
Obito...

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.980
Even if it's someone they used to make fun of...

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.030
when people see someone trying twice as hard as others,

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.400
they instinctively start wanting to lend a hand.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.150
That's because...

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.980
people eventually learn that they only have each other

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.230
to fill the holes in their hearts.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.860
I'm giving a Rasengan to each of you!

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.480
Use it to blast through his shield!

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.360
This, right?

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.980
Can I really do this?

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.480
You can!

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.780
And he who possesses a heart filled with comrades...

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.940
is truly powerful!

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.570
Go get him, everyone!

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.820
Why am I...

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.980
seeing such images...?

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.190
Just like we thought!

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.820
The chakra you received from the Tailed Beasts earlier

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.280
reacted to the Tailed Beast Chakra inside him and

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.280
you were able to pull it all out in one shot!

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.150
Yeah!

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.530
This wouldn't have worked

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.440
if the Tailed Beasts hadn't taken a liking to you back then

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.190
and shared their chakra with you.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.440
I only told you how to stop me.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.860
I never told you how to save me.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.570
You should have told me that from the beginning!

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.400
Why aren't Tailed Beasts more straightforward?!

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.230
So what are you gonna do?

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.480
Before I tell you, I have something to pass on to you.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.440
What?

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.230
Hold out your hand... Huh? You're giving me something?

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.030
It's something good.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.570
It will come in handy one of these days.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.440
Hurry up!

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.440
We assembled here on Four Tails summons...

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.480
And hung around after promising to tell and give you something.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.440
Oh, he said something like that?

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.780
I'm glad that you're all gathered together and getting along!

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:45.730
That only happened after Four Tails and Roshi left here.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.570
It's all thanks to you, Naruto.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.900
Naruto, step forward and extend your hand...

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.610
We shall now fulfill our promise to Four Tails...

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.530
rather Son Goku.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.610
My name is Matatabi.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.230
Yugito Ni'i...

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.230
My name is Isobu.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.110
We've met before, huh!

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.690
I'm Yagura, the former Fourth Mizukage.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.570
I am Kokuo.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.030
I'm Han.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.280
Me, I be called Saiken.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.900
You already know me, I'm Utakata.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.820
I'm Lucky Seven Chomei.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:25.780
I'm Fu!

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.190
Naruto...

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.860
You really are something special...

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.320
Now!

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.570
You know what to do next, right, Naruto?

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.440
It's a tug-of-war!

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.610
Just pull the Tailed Beasts' chakra right out of him!

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.480
Yeah!

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.190
Damn!

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.400
I guess it won't work with One Tail and Eight Tails

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.610
because we never got their chakra.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.190
One Tail used to be linked to me.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.480
I'll get him.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.860
Gaara!

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.780
Come here, Shukaku!

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.780
We finally found a weakness, that's the key!

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.860
You can leave Eight-o's chakra to me!

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.690
Octopops!

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.070
Let's do this, Bee! Don't lose!

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:56.730
Extract them!

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.400
Then the only power he'll have left is the Ten Tails' shell!

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.110
And the Divine Tree's bud will not bloom!

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.570
They've stopped...

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.190
Which means...

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.230
he's lost control of the Divine Tree!

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.650
In other words...

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.360
Everyone...

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.360
Remember when I said that even a small power can be helpful

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.780
depending on how it's used?

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.570
Now is the time!

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.980
That power will change the course of this world...

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.150
Listen closely.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.780
It's because your chakra is connected to his!

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.610
His feelings will flow into you, but don't let them distract you!

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.320
Don't underestimate the power of the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.400
I'm equivalent to the Sage of the Six Paths!

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.690
Just keep pulling, Naruto.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.110
Naruto! You're the one who asked us to lend a hand!

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.440
So we're helping out until the very end!

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:14.480
Guys!

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.030
And that's not all...

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.150
Everyone! Grab onto my chakra!

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.570
This one?

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.940
All right!

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.190
Everyone, we'll do it together on my mark!

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.320
Pull!

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.820
Are you saying…

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.360
That I…

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.480
I've got regrets...?!

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.940
You once told me...

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.570
"I'm nobody..

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.860
"I don't want to be anybody..."

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.320
Stop! Don't come into my thoughts!

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.400
But the truth is...

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.150
You wanted to become the Hokage, just like me.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:17.480
It could have even ended up where I was chasing after your shadow...

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.440
since I've always wanted to become the Hokage.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.480
I threw away the past and my naïve self!

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:25.530
So don't tell me I'm—

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.280
Then why am I able to see this?

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.110
You can't hide behind a mask.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.440
You were Kakashi Sensei's friend...

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.360
my dad's subordinate... an Uchiha like Sasuke...

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.610
and a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf who had the same dream as me.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.110
What... What exactly...

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.650
do you want with me?!

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:55.440
To remind you that you are Obito Uchiha.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:00.980
I told you, didn't I?

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.900
I swore I'd tear that mask right off your face!

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.140
Obito Uchiha?!

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:43.230
What meaning is there in that name... in that existence now?

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.730
Now that I've merged with the Ten Tails,

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.100
I've transcended and attained enlightenment.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.810
In other words, I am no longer human.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.060
I am the one who will lead mankind to its next stage.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.190
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Obito Uchiha"

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.940
I am the Second Sage of the Six Paths!

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:08.980
OBITO UCHIHA Tune in again!
