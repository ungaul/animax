WEBVTT

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.410
Thank you for letting me be your mom.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.410
And thank you for letting Minato be your dad.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.080
Thank you for being… born to us!

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.990
Thank you…

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.700
Thank you so much.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.240
Mom…

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.370
From now on,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.240
I promise I'll eat vegetables and not just ramen.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.160
I like taking baths, so don't worry about that.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.120
I go to the hot springs a lot too.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.660
And I get lots of sleep.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.450
In fact, I sleep too much, ya know!

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.620
As for friends, I have lots of good ones.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.740
I wish you could have met them.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.950
There's one that I'm not getting along with though.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.160
As for studying… Well, you feared right, Mom.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.580
But I don't get depressed over that, ya know!

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.950
A lot happened with my teachers and upperclassmen

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.200
during my Academy days, but we respect each other now.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.740
Master Jiraiya taught me about the Three Shinobi Prohibitions.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.370
You were right about him, Mom!

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.330
But he's the one who taught me how a shinobi should live!

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.240
He was a great shinobi.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.200
I'm Naruto Uzumaki, a ninja of the Hidden Leaf!

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.410
My dream is to become the Hokage!

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.030
And I'll surpass all the Hokage who came before me!

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.410
And I'm going to be cooler than Dad!

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.660
And I'm going to be a stronger shinobi than you, Mom!

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.200
Battle in Paradise! Odd Beast vs. The Monster!"

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.370
All right!

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.830
What happened?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.120
Did it go well?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.660
A lot of things happened.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.870
Yo!

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.870
I see! I get it! Understood!

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.240
Your expression now is looking good!

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.530
What about the Nine Tails?

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.450
Did you get it under control?

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.580
That's real good news.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.200
Especially when you used it, in that situation, yo!

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.990
Whoa, Naruto! Don't tell me that by that, you mean…

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.950
You know what?!

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.280
Yup!

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.660
That's right, ya know!

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.950
So tell me what happened!

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.370
This, that… How am I supposed to understand?!

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.580
This is all on purpose!

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.580
You're talking like that on purpose!

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.120
That much I know!

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.870
What?!

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.410
Naruto's going through harsh training like that?!

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.030
I can't ignore a young man

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.530
struggling during the springtime of his youth!

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.660
Take me to Naruto!

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.530
He…is a bit eccentric.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.780
So I apologize.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.830
It's all right.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.580
Relax, Captain Yamato.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.030
I have the Nine Tails' chakra safe

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.910
in a separate place inside me.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.200
So that I'm not using it all the time.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.280
This is how it is when I use the Nine Tails' chakra.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.450
Amazing… It's overflowing with life energy.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.370
I can't believe my Wood Style is affected by it.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.620
What?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.700
You really think… you're hidden?

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.200
Do you sense some other chakra?

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.950
He senses another's proximity… That I couldn't, was hasty of me.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.080
Impossible!

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.240
My chakra is the same as Samehada.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.240
There's no way anyone could sense it!

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.120
It's not chakra!

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.580
It feels hazy…something sinister.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.080
That's it! That thing!

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.080
The sword?

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.240
It seems that you can sense hatred and feelings of evil.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.580
The limitations of Sensory-Types don't apply.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.160
Is that the power of a Jinchuriki

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.780
who has mastery over the Nine Tails?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.080
You're the shark guy of the Akatsuki!

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.530
How? I thought we chopped his head off a ways back…

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.120
Let's do this!

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.120
Okay… Brother!

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.870
Water Style: Super Shark—!

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.660
– Double Lariat! – Double Lariat!

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.950
How did you manage to escape our tag-team attack?

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.330
I simply switched out

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.330
while we battled inside the bubble of water.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.410
Ink… A smokescreen.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.780
You are an octopus, after all.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.280
However…

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.580
With my body merged to Samehada,

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.080
I can detect chakra through my skin.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.830
You cut off my clone's head.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.330
Don't you think you're overdoing it?

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.330
Don't you think that was just right for the Eight-Tails?

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.700
I guess it's my turn now.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.740
I leave it in your hands.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.950
Clones disappear when they're struck!

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.280
The corpse remained post-mortem…no question.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.240
And if someone else had transformed into you,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.410
Cee would have sensed it.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.240
So it's a perplexing consternation.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.870
It was a special kind of clone.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.240
A Parasitic Clone that I can manipulate remotely.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.080
Anyway, enough about this subject.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.950
Now then, two Jinchuriki and a Wood Style user…

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.740
I am in a serious predicament.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.160
What?

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.950
How did you know the way to open the door to this room?!

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.200
That's a silly question.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.160
I came here to spy.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.120
Was that the Teleportation Jutsu?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.370
The first smash… Just like the Yellow Flash!

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.370
So fast… I didn't expect that.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.330
My foot!

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.200
I had so much force, I hit it too hard!

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.280
It seems you're not up to the Fourth Hokage's level yet.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.030
Bee! Please go after him!

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.200
I'll see to Naruto.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.120
Right! Leave the chase to me. I'll catch him in a jiffy.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.830
What?

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.620
Your true self appears from inside the waterfall?

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.370
Is that for real?

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.530
Yes. Naruto faced and defeated his true self at this very spot.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.330
Guy, why don't you try it out for yourself?

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.030
Don't be stupid!

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.280
We have to go and help Naruto first!

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.330
I came here as a teacher to protect Naruto!

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.740
Don't get so upset.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.240
Are you afraid to face your true self?

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.780
Is that it?

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.490
What did you say?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.780
You think I'm scared?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.950
No problem!

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.660
No, I was just joking.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.700
I have a feeling your true self isn't human.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.910
Don't take me so seriously.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.410
Honestly, you really shouldn't be going on about "youth," should you?

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.490
Overdoing things can hurt a man past his prime like you.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.330
I know you have to keep up appearances for Lee's sake.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.450
But no one expects you to force yourself to stay youthful.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.700
Show yourself!

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.330
You can say what you like to my face!

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.370
Fine.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.280
You can take a long, hard look at your true self.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.240
Is this my true self?!

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.870
An Odd Insect?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.740
I'm sure this is… the Odd Beast!

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.990
What?!

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.910
Hey me! The one who has forgotten what youth is!

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.620
I'll beat some sense into you!

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.780
Guy!

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.240
That's not your true self!

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.030
Watch out!

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.330
Leaf Rock… Crushing Square!

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.200
It's not my true self.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.660
Take a good look!

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.410
It's not you, no matter how you look at it!

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.740
The moment you open your eyes,

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.620
you leave the Waterfall of Truth!

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.200
This is… I'm certain it's…

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.240
the fish they call puffer fish!

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.740
No… Maybe it was a porcupine fish?

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.410
This region has lots of strange creatures, so…

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.700
Is that really a puffer fish? It's supposed to be real tasty.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.370
Are you all deliberately playing the fool?

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.030
I see that you are still dumber than a beast.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.620
He's an Akatsuki agent!

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.410
If he escapes, they'll get Intel on us.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.870
And that would be a huge abasement!

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.830
Damn you, Samehada…

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.330
He's the shark fellow of the Akatsuki

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.280
who was teamed up with Itachi.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.240
He looks weakened.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.330
How did he get in?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.330
I see, I see… He forced you.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.280
That must've been pretty tough.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.580
That's kind of creepy.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.200
Hey, hey! Don't play too rough!

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.490
But what can I say, I got the right stuff!

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.120
Darn it! He's underwater!

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.280
He's a Water Style user!

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.280
I'm aware of that.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:51.870
Bee, watch out!

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.700
He's taking your chakra!

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.200
Huh?

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.620
Why do strong people tend to be pretty dense, damn it?!

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.240
Cut it out STAT… But you're so cute that…

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.330
I'm getting weak in the knees…

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.700
Guy! Please assist me!

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.620
I'm going to get data from him instead!

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.450
Hidden Jutsu! Stone Needles!

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.160
All right!

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.200
A jutsu where chakra is poured in to stop my movement.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.530
Now that's perfect!

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.910
Is he absorbing my chakra instead?

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.030
So much pull!

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.450
Leaf Hurricane!

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.240
You got all your chakra back.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.740
Water Style!

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.410
Shark Bomb Jutsu!

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.950
Damn it, he got away!

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.530
He's fast!

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.160
If he gets past the barrier around this island, it's all over.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.120
We must stop him before that,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.910
because my sensory powers won't work then.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.580
I'll stop him!

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.240
The Eight Inner Gates!

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.330
The Sixth Gate of Joy: Open!

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.700
Let yourself be captured by the arms of my Eight Tails…

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.240
Odd Beast!

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.240
Far, far away you'll go…

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.240
In the direction of ten o'clock I'll throw.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.870
Don't sacrifice the truth just for a rhyme!

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.530
He went towards two o'clock!

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.830
All right!

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.490
Are you all right, Bee?

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.870
I'm okay.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.200
I'll be good right away.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.280
You got a lot of chakra taken away from you!

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.120
We may be able to stop him.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.280
Naruto and Yamato are behind this waterfall, right?

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.370
I twisted my ankle.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.370
Be careful about keeping your power under control!

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.450
All right. Let's go!

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.120
Yeah!

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.280
I'm counting on you!

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.490
I was going to say it's been a while… but really, midair?

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.410
I'm going to borrow your back!

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.030
Ouch!!

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.910
Damn it, Guy! Using me as a stepping-stone!

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.200
Up we go.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.830
H-Hello…

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.330
Looks like I gave them the slip.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.280
Summoning Jutsu…

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.200
You're persistent!

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.330
So… That scroll you gave to that shark contains Intel on us.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.200
I won't let you get away!

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.490
I wouldn't be so sure. I have the geographical advantage.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.280
Water Style! Thousand Hungry Sharks!

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.990
I don't know which shark is which.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:06.950
In that case…!

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.780
Asakujaku!

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:33.700
Where's the scroll?

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.490
Damn it. There are too many of them.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.530
It can't be helped. I have to cover a wider area.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.740
He won't let the sharks in the water go either.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:51.030
Fine.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.580
I'll just let them tear you apart!

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.450
The Seventh Gate of Shock!

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.830
Open!

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.620
I see…

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.330
A taijutsu that crushes opponents with a shock wave

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.160
of air and flames created from the friction of punched air!

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.620
An Odd Beast indeed.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:26.280
A shinobi with taijutsu this powerful is truly rare.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.910
This will be the third time for me.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.280
The next taijutsu will be nothing like the previous ones.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.410
It's a special single-blow attack.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.120
It's something you'll rarely see…

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.410
The blue chakra is pushing the water away.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:46.740
Water Style!

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.200
Super Shark Bomb Jutsu!

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.830
Hirudora!

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.200
This Super Shark Bomb is no ordinary jutsu.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.740
The jutsu itself absorbs chakra and becomes even stronger.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.410
And the stronger the opponent's ninjutsu, the stronger it gets.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.190
the stronger it gets.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.330
What's going on?

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.330
I exhausted his jutsu…

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.450
but my Super Shark Bomb isn't getting stronger?!

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.280
I know I absorbed his chakra!

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.580
Was that not a chakra Energy Bomb?!

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.280
Roar, my youth!

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.330
In the Hidden Mist, here is a great obstacle one must overcome

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.160
to be a true shinobi…

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:49.700
The sensation of killing your own comrade is indescribable.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:56.330
I will say that I felt I was trapped in a false existence.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.490
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Man Named Kisame"

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.330
This world really is full of lies.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.120
Tune in again!
