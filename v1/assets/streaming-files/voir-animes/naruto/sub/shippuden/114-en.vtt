WEBVTT

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.270
That's about it...

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.800
Scouting complete.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.570
Same as usual, nothing suspicious.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.000
It's another nice day.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.800
Granny, hurry! Hurry!

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.470
Now, now. Don't be so hasty.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.100
A stick of this after a mission...

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.600
This is what I live for.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.670
C'mon, hurry and pick a card.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.130
Byakugan!

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.370
H-Hey! No fair!

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.670
You can't use Byakugan in a game!

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.800
Well, I guess I'll start on the next report that's due.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.370
Is he from...the Akatsuki?!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.370
Right! Must report this to Lady Hokage!

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.170
What?!

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.030
The time has come.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.960
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.050
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.470
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.390
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.190
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.490
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.700
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.330
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:50.960
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.960
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.130
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.350
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.850
koete Someday...

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.930
Assault on the Leaf Village!

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.270
CIPHER DIVISION Lord Jiraiya sent back three sources of information...

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.030
Namely, a ninja from the Hidden Rain...

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.800
Pain's corpse...and...

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.330
this secret message.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.600
Knowing Inoichi in the Intel Division,

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.700
he'll be able to get some kind of information

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.270
out of the Hidden Rain ninja.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.130
Master Shizune has put top priority

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.800
on the autopsy of Pain's corpse.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.830
She's sure to learn something too.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.470
And this message we decoded with help from Naruto...

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.570
"The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them."

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.630
We'll have to take all this information

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.900
and figure out the mystery behind this guy named Pain.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.270
The mystery of someone who could even take down Lord Jiraiya.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.830
HIDDEN LEAF INTEL DIVISION

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.830
A genjutsu block...

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.830
I'm going to take a peek into your mind.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.800
So many genjutsu blocks...

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.070
No wonder truth serum didn't work on him.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.200
How did it go?

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.900
It's no use...

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.830
Someone's placed blocks inside his mind.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.130
It's going to be difficult to navigate past them.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.270
It's probably some jutsu placed on him by the one named Pain.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.700
Please be careful, Inoichi.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.430
There may be genjutsu traps set in there as well.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.130
Yes, I'm aware of that.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.730
AUTOPSY ROOM 3 SHIZUNE OYONE KUMADORI

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.300
These black rods, which were embedded in the corpse...

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.730
Could they be a special feature of these men known as Pain?

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.830
Why did they embed this into the body?

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.000
I must learn more about

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.330
the properties of this metal before the autopsy.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.470
CIPHER DIVISION "The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them."

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.170
Maybe the six Pains were genjutsu...

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.900
A jutsu created by the female Akatsuki member

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.630
who was also said to be present.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.270
And she's the one who physically attacked Lord Jiraiya

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.500
from the shadows.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.900
No... That's hard to imagine.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.570
According to Lord Fukasaku,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.400
Lord Jiraiya died from being stabbed by real weapons

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.970
wielded by all six of them.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.930
Well, he took down three of them,

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.870
but they supposedly resurrected themselves...

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.830
It does sound like some unbelievable genjutsu.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.870
Common sense has no meaning when it comes to the Akatsuki.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.530
There have been others who were immortal.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.730
In any case, let's keep hypothesizing all possible scenarios

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.870
until we get reports from the others.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.530
You're right.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.070
Let's at least be a little closer to solving Pain's mystery

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.100
by the time Naruto returns from his training.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.070
Well then...

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.170
I'm going to procure us some fresh ingredients.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.270
Not more of that gross stuff... Aw man...

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.670
Ma! Make sure you get some stamina-building stuff!

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.770
You are able to mold Sage Jutsu chakra

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.630
and have pretty much mastered Frog Kumite and Sage Techniques.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.270
Now I have one final thing to say to you.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.870
Wh-What is it? You're suddenly so serious.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.230
Well... It's about the risks of using Sage Mode.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.470
Risks?

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.730
Yes... Once you fully grasp the risks involved,

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.700
then you can use Sage Mode to its fullest extent!

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.900
So, what are the risks?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.800
First, as you're probably aware,

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.700
you can't maintain Sage Mode for too long.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.600
Maybe five minutes at most.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.870
Also, to amass the Nature Energy necessary to enter Sage Mode,

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.770
you must follow the principle of staying still.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.570
Thus, it cannot be used once you begin battle.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.630
For when you are still,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.470
you become an easy target for your enemy.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.930
Ow!

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.100
I see... Right?

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.670
So the only time you can go into Sage Mode is

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.900
when you've got plenty of comrades around you

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.630
that can free you up.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.900
If you are alone, but must go into Sage Mode,

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.730
withdraw from the battle momentarily and gather Nature Energy.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.600
What?! Then Sage Mode is useless!

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.300
So what was all this training for?!

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.600
Don't be so disappointed.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.430
That is why I am here, to alleviate that risk.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.800
What do you mean?

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.230
If you and I merge our bodies, it'll be fine!

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.330
No!!

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.000
When I say merge,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.970
it simply means to be lightly attached to your shoulder or back.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.170
Oh, that's all...

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.430
But how does merging make things fine?

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.670
Simply put, it's to split the roles of stillness and action.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.770
When one is moving,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.800
the other stays still and gathers Nature Energy.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.270
In Jiraiya-boy's case, the final form of his Sage Mode

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.830
had Ma and me both riding his shoulders.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.100
I see... I get it now...

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.670
Don't you worry, Naruto-boy!

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.500
Okay!

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.930
From here on,

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.000
we'll be splitting into two teams: diversion and search.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.570
I'll go over it again.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.300
Diversion will be made up of Shurado, Chikushodo, and Gakido.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:51.400
Search will be Tendo, Ningendo, and Jigokudo.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.070
Konan, you're with the search team.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.930
I know.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.130
The Hidden Leaf Village...

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.500
is surrounded by a spherical barrier that

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.800
includes underground and aerial coverage.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.400
Which means anyone who enters without permission

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.670
is detected immediately.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.970
As planned, we will launch Chikushodo

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.700
into the Hidden Leaf's aerial space.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.830
We will confuse the enemy

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.730
by not giving them an accurate count.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.700
Wait for Chikushodo's summoning.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.400
I was told Itachi and Kisame infiltrated easily.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.300
Itachi once belonged to the Leaf's Anbu Black Ops.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.030
He knew the password to get through the barrier.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.170
I have my own way of doing things.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.670
Starting here, the world shall know pain...

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.170
An intruder!

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.430
Single target, west gate, sector I-B

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.800
Hurry, hurry!

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:07.930
Yes, I'm coming dear.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.770
AUTOPSY ROOM 3 SHIZUNE OYONE KUMADORI

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.330
Thanks for the food!

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.600
Yes, thank you!

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.000
Disperse!

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:41.700
What is that?

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.830
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.300
My Fire Style has no effect!

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.770
It's all over the place! What's going on?!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.970
I thought there was just one intruder!

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.270
I'll confirm with the Byakugan right away!

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.670
This is beyond the scope of just the Barrier Corps!

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.400
Contact other troops and request backup! Hurry!

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.270
Right!

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.170
I'll go notify Lady Hokage!

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.700
He holds no information on the Nine-Tails.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.600
Where is Naruto Uzumaki?

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.070
He doesn't know either...

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.900
AUTOPSY ROOM 3 SHIZUNE OYONE KUMADORI

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.900
The chakra meter shot up suddenly and the black rod began warming up,

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.330
so I thought it was strange.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.500
These are demodulators for receiving high frequency chakra waves.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.330
Demodulator? Which means what?

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.830
In other words, they're chakra receivers!

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.070
And, it's receiving at this very moment!

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.900
Receiver? What do you mean?

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.670
If this is a receiver...

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.200
I don't have time to explain.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.770
I have to notify Lady Tsunade immediately...

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.330
CIPHER DIVISION

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.330
What was that?

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:21.730
What's that?

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:22.770
Let's go!

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.870
HIDDEN LEAF INTEL DIVISION

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.030
Found it!

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:17.900
What was that?

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.100
Choji! I'll notify the Intel Division.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.030
Right!

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.670
I have to get to Pa!

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.530
Father! The village is...

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.200
Run!

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.470
Tami!

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.600
Cha!

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.500
Are you all right?!

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.730
U-Uh-huh.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.070
Th-Thank you so much!

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.700
The centipede is down... Seems that girl did it.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.430
Thank goodness! Your wound is not too deep.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.130
Thank you...

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.100
Sakura!

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.200
Are you all right?

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.570
Iruka Sensei... Just what's going on?

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.230
I don't know.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.070
But someone is attacking the Leaf Village!

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.570
The situation has been reported to Lady Tsunade.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.230
The alarm should sound soon.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.330
The village is under direct attack?

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.970
Who would do such a thing?

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.930
Let's go, Iruka!

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.000
Right!

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.500
Sakura, hurry to the hospital and tend to the wounded.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.630
It's full of injured people.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:20.730
Yes, sir!

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:27.830
It can't be...

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.770
Miss...

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.300
It's going to be all right!

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.130
We have Lady Hokage on our side!

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.400
Uh-huh!

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.530
Barrier Corps reporting!

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.070
An intruder entered Hidden Leaf Village through our air space.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.270
Our sensors picked up a single target.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.500
But shortly after detection, several attacks were confirmed.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.100
Analysis Corps reporting!

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.930
Enemy strength estimated as three battalions in size!

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.830
A foe capable of organizing this much military power unnoticed...

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.530
It must be...

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.200
Reporting! I have a witness report on the intruder!

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.100
He wore black with a red cloud pattern.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.770
The Akatsuki... So they've finally come.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:36.600
I can't help but hope that he is the Child of Prophecy.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:41.270
For Jiraiya-boy has entrusted his all to that child.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.230
Sound the state of emergency alarm.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:00.900
And...

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.100
Recall Naruto!

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.200
Who do you think you are?!

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.800
Still treating him like a mere child!

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.400
The will of the Hidden Leaf has been passed on,

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.770
and it's growing!

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.500
Naruto strives to surpass Jiraiya this very minute!

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.800
Just as my grandfather, the First Hokage,

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.670
believed and entrusted the Leaf to you.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.900
It is now your turn to believe and entrust to the next generation!

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.700
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Power to Believe"

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.000
Tune in again!
