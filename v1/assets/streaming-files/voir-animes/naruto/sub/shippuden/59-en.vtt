WEBVTT

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.900
Zetsu, huh?

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.300
It appears it's done.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.570
Finally finished with your drawn-out ritual, huh?

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.170
Nothing but annoying atheist jerks who don't understand prayer!

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.600
When you're sad and alone, you can only trust in yourself.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.630
No, you're wrong.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.930
You can only trust in money.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.400
Oh, here we go!

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.230
We've fallen behind with our Jinchuriki hunt

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.630
mostly because of your side job!

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.770
I teamed up with you because you said religion is profitable.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.200
I've been left in charge of Akatsuki finances.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.730
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.570
Money is important.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.670
More importantly, search for the next one immediately.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.800
I'll take charge of the Two-Tails.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.500
Are you sure you're okay?

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.370
You were in the hospital until only yesterday, right?

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.830
That was just blown out of proportion!

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.700
That's enough talking. Let's continue the training...

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.970
That's what I'd like to say. But first let's confirm the basics.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.670
Forget about that!

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.930
Let's hurry up and start the training for my new knockout Jutsu!

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.070
The Super Ultra Deluxe Rasengan, or the Special Naruto Uzumaki Rasengan,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.130
or something like that!

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.530
That's what we're doing Change in Chakra Nature training for, right?

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.370
The five basic property types are fire, wind, water, lightning and earth.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.900
And in your case... My Chakra property is wind!

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.200
Then for the time being,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.330
shall we go with what we've done so far?

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.300
Right! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.370
Steady and sharp!

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.700
We did it!

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.030
How about that, Kakashi Sensei?!

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.300
Huh?

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.730
Good grief.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.970
He pushes it even though he's still healing...

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.170
The Multi Shadow Clone is primarily used

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.930
as an approach for increasing the effects of the training.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.370
It's not necessary for showing the results of training.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.330
Well, it is Naruto's style, though.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.800
Akatsuki's Invasion

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.870
How deep into the mountains is it?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.270
We're almost there.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.270
You've been saying that the whole time!

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.700
Come on. Give me a break! We've got to climb again?!

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.830
What if it turns out there's no Jinchuriki?!

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.330
I'll be really upset!

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.370
I don't give a darn about you. If you keep wailing like a little kid...

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.030
I'll kill you.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.400
Come on. Don't give me that, Kakuzu!

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.930
Oh, man! What an anti-social jerk.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.670
Even if there are several changes...

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.730
this would be the best plan under the present conditions, huh?

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.970
Yes.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.270
Get everything compiled and

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.070
have it ready to transmit in two or three days.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.800
Understood.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.800
Sorry to cause you trouble...

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.930
But we can't just sit around doing nothing.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.630
Are you awake?

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.870
Huh...?

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.200
Again... I...

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.330
You keep resting.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.630
Fatigue tends to build up

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.670
when using the Multi Shadow Clones training approach.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.900
Let's start the training again after you've rested a little while.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.370
What're we going to do next?

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.500
Next?

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.170
The next step is...

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.270
to cut that waterfall!

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.970
Put your hands on the waterfall and cut it

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.870
by hammering it with your Wind Chakra.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.830
Cut...the waterfall?

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.800
For this training, you need to instantly create

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.300
a Change in Chakra Nature in a large amount of Chakra.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.470
Or else you won't be able to cut the waterfall.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.770
You'll more or less be able to use it in real battle

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.130
if you can pass this stage of training.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.400
Kakashi Sensei!

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.100
If I can do that,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.670
it means I have learned my first Change in Chakra Nature, right?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.700
All right, I'm getting better!

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.430
I never thought that clumsy Naruto

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.870
would be able to create a Change in Chakra Nature so soon.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.930
This training approach... was a big success.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.000
Break time is over!

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.570
Let's get right back to training!

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.230
Wood Style Jutsu!

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.630
That will be your training area.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.770
Right.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.900
But hold on!

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.570
Whoa... What is it?

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.300
You'll need Yamato's Chakra control at all times during this training.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.870
I'm counting on you, Yamato.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.070
Okay.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.630
STABILIZE

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.600
Preparations complete, Naruto!

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.270
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.470
Form a mental image of my Wind Chakra and...

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.870
Listen up. The Wind Change in Chakra Nature...

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.770
splits Chakra in two and grinds them together.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.470
Grinds them together?

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.930
And then you build up the two Chakra as if steadily sharpening them.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.170
As if steadily...sharpening them...

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.530
That's right... The trick is steadier...and sharper.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.200
Steady and sharp!

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.070
Let's go, guys!

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.330
Right!

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.670
Damn it! The water should splash just a bit...

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.400
Let's go to the next one!

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.430
Right!

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.300
As to be expected, this will probably take a while.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.870
Well, be patient.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.770
That should be it for the ingredients...

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.900
Now I can make him some of my special Sakura Food Pills!

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.670
I'm sure he'll force himself into doing more reckless training.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.530
Geez...

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.570
Getting stronger with determination just isn't done anymore.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.830
Not only does excessive training take a toll on the body,

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.770
but it could also have a reverse effect.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.100
Not only that, he also has the physical idiosyncrasy

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.230
that allows him to work much harder than other people.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.570
That's right! The least I can do is to help him any way I can.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.570
Damn it!

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.630
Damn...

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.870
He'll probably start getting impatient pretty soon.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.530
This is a temple. Is there a Jinchuriki in a place like this?

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.830
Who knows?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.600
But this isn't an ordinary temple, so there's a good possibility.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.600
What was that?!

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.630
Someone destroyed the Iron Wall Seal!

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.400
Report this to Lord Chiriku!

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.100
It doesn't look like these guys want to convert to the Jashin religion.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.870
None of these guys do...

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.770
That cloak... It's the rumored...

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.030
No doubt about it! It's the Akatsuki!

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:17.970
We have intruders!

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.370
Who are they?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.570
They are with the Akatsuki!

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.400
I knew they'd come here eventually, but...

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.900
I'll go! Everyone else provide backup.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.900
Looks like we've got another virtuous looking one...

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.700
He's not just virtuous.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:50.170
He's got a 30 million ryo bounty on his head in our Bingo Book.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.000
Hey... You're not after money, are you?

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.330
You'll go to hell if you kill a monk for something like that.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.030
Money is the key that opens all doors. That's just what I want.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.430
I don't know what you guys want. But please leave quietly.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.500
No meaningless slaughter, huh?

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.830
But it doesn't work like that in my religion.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.470
The Temple of Fire is the greatest Shinobi temple in the Land of Fire.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.770
And it is said that all of the monks control the special power

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.700
known as the Gift of the Sages.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.730
And the 30 million-ryo man is a Ninja

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.970
who was once chosen as a member of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.700
who protected the Feudal Lord of the Land of Fire.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.570
And the proof is that breechcloth with the Land of Fire emblem on it...

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.030
No kidding? Is he that incredible?

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.870
Don't get careless. You'll die.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.300
Don't give me that...

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.170
Kakuzu!

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.070
What's that?!

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.100
I don't care. Let's keep going.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.800
You're mine!

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.100
- Oh. - Lord Chiriku won!

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.330
I'll give you a funeral.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.400
Who would accept a different religion's funeral?

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.930
I'd receive divine retribution from Lord Jashin...

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.030
Now I'm mad...

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.730
Hey... If this guy isn't a Jinchuriki...

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.400
I can defend my commandments, right?

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:28.270
Do as you like. But his body is worth money.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.870
Don't go overboard... Make sure he's recognizable.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:39.470
Exchanging life for money isn't something for people to do...

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.770
Good grief.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.130
Kakuzu! Stay out of this!

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.500
I'll take care of...this guy!

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.500
Chiriku of the Temple of Fire will not lose to wicked men like you!

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.700
Raikei!

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.030
Thousand Hand Strike!

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.330
It appears there was no Jinchuriki here.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.800
Let's move on to the next one as soon as I'm done with my prayer.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.200
No...

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.300
I'm taking this body to trade in for money.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.070
Money comes first.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:50.070
Listen, you're really starting to irritate me. Really...

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.770
I've got to inform the Hidden Leaf...

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.700
Then let's get going.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.100
The Land of Fire is huge. Let's take our time.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.800
I knew we were falling behind because of you.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.370
Ow!

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.600
Wait! Hey!

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.570
Kakashi Sensei!

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.970
Don't you think I need more Shadow Clones?!

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.030
You can't cut the waterfall unless you perform

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.400
the Change in Chakra Nature on a large amount of wind Chakra!

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.830
The Chakra for each clone will disperse if there are too many of them!

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.730
And we can barely line up ten clones with the width of that waterfall!

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.730
Do you really want me to learn this or not

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:48.170
Then tell us the trick to get just a little bit better!

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.330
You're not holding the Chakra

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.430
you've built up inside your body long enough!

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:54.830
Take your time and be more efficient!

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:59.170
But if we don't get a move on, this won't be of any use in a real battle.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.570
You're in training right now.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.930
You don't need to be thinking about real battles.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.000
It will get quicker once you get used to it.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.530
But...

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.630
Listen...

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.030
Change in Chakra Nature training normally takes several years.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.570
Under normal conditions, it takes six months to even cut a leaf.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.600
You completed that in only a few hours.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.000
No need to be so impatient.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.400
You're progressing several times faster than we expected.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.200
It even took a genius like Sasuke several days

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.270
to master the Lightning Change in Chakra Nature

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.330
when I taught him the Chidori.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.970
MAKE-OUT TACTICS

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.000
I have to catch up with Sasuke!

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.470
STABILIZE Good grief...

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.900
Tenzo...

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:02.930
Understood.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.770
That was a little tough on you, huh?

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.670
No! Not at all.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.330
N-Not in the least...

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.730
It was tough...

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.930
How's that, Naruto?!

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.200
Now you've got nothing to gripe about, right?!

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.200
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.270
Wh-What did you say? The Temple of Fire was attacked?!

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.900
It was probably guys from the Akatsuki.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.900
They're going one by one to locations in the Land of Fire

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.530
where there might be Jinchuriki.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:47.270
They've come at last.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:48.800
We won't let them out of the Land of Fire.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.670
Contact the twenty newly formed platoons immediately!

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.700
Yes, ma'am!

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.130
I want to know what they're after, but they are pretty powerful.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.500
Destroy them if they can't be restrained!

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.670
Next time: "Under the Starry Sky"
