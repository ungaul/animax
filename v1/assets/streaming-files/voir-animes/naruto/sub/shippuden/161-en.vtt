00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.080
Good job, Yamato.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.880
No, that wasn't me.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.630
Naruto stopped it all by himself.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.920
But is it okay to leave things like this?

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.960
Right now, Naruto and Nine Tails are in a confrontation…

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.630
It better be settled soon. We want it to meet our hopeful expectations!

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.580
All this waiting is so drawn out!

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.540
To pass the time, why don't we work out?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.750
This isn't the time to be rapping!

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.040
Shuddup!

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.580
Right now, Naruto is locked in an internal battle with Nine Tails.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.670
We cannot help him any further.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.580
If you really care about Naruto's wellbeing,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.290
all we can do now…

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.040
is to have faith in him and wait.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.460
I love you.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.500
What is this?

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.000
I feel so calm…

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.250
I love you.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.880
I feel so happy.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.540
Damn you, Kushina!

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.540
What is this?

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.000
This is real nice!

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.500
For now, keeping watch will suffice!

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290
My chakra that's suppressing the Nine Tails won't last much longer!

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.540
This is your chance to do it!

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.580
All right!

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.420
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.750
You brat!

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.710
Just as I thought. He's really strong!

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.040
Take this!

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.250
Rasengan Super Barrage!

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.460
Don't underestimate me!

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.830
I can keep going, ya know!

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.920
Here!

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.710
That's…

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.710
Sage Mode!

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.830
Sage Art!

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.830
Massive…

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.630
Rasengan Barrage!

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.670
One more round!

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.580
What kind of power is this?

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.920
Pull!

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.750
Get out!

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.250
You did it! You pulled the Nine Tails' chakra out!

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.670
This is…

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.460
This is the Nine Tails'…

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.630
Naruto…

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.960
You…

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.080
You have infuriated me, Naruto!

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.750
You still have that much power…

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.960
You really are amazing.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.290
This is the Six Paths…?!

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.630
You watch out, Naruto.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.880
I'm sorry…Nine Tails.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.670
But I'll make it up to you.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.580
So just hang in there for a little while.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.790
You did it, Naruto!

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.420
Yeah.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.710
Ma, where are you going now?

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.710
I can finally go and join Minato.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.830
There's something I must tell you before I go.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.170
Naruto…

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.000
It's about when you were born 16 years ago.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.170
I'll tell you what really happened.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.500
What really happened… 16 years ago?

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.420
I was the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki before you.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.790
Let's start from there.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.500
Target: Nine Tails

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.380
You were the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki, Ma?

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.210
Yes.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.000
Before I can tell you what happened 16 years ago,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.710
I need to tell you more about me.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.330
I was chosen as the second Jinchuriki host of Nine Tails.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.330
Truth be told, I was brought here for the express purpose

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.000
of being the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki…

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.540
LAND OF FIRE LAND OF EDDIES from the Land of Eddies.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.830
Why?

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.130
Why did they have to choose someone from another land?!

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.170
You're right. I'm from a different land, and village.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.630
But the Land of Fire and the Land of Eddies,

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.630
as well as Hidden Leaf Village and Hidden Eddy Village,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.670
share a deep bond.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.630
The shinobi of the Senju Clan of the Hidden Leaf

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.880
and the shinobi of the Uzumaki Clan of the Hidden Eddy

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.830
were distant blood relatives.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.630
Our people lived long.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.500
So the Hidden Eddy Village was also known as the Village of Longevity.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.580
And we specialized in Sealing Jutsu.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.880
We were also a rowdy bunch.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.670
The Tetragram Seal on your abdomen is based

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.960
on a jutsu from our village.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:19.830
And Minato, your father, learned various Sealing Jutsu from my mother.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.580
Naruto, the symbol on your back…

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.670
That is the symbol of the Hidden Eddy.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.790
Even today in Hidden Leaf Village

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.540
that symbol is a symbol of friendship, isn't it?

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.290
So the Hidden Eddy Village…?

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.630
It no longer exists.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.920
During the era of war,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.170
our sealing jutsu abilities were greatly feared,

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.920
so the village was targeted and destroyed.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.040
Those who survived feared for their safety,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.710
so they hid their identities and scattered throughout the region.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.460
Still…why were you chosen?!

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.630
It seems that even among the Hidden Eddy,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:11.670
I was born with powerful chakra able to suppress the Nine Tails.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.630
Do you know about the battle…

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.540
between the First Hokage, Hashirama Senju, and Madara Uchiha?

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.500
Uh-huh…

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.630
The Jinchuriki before me was the woman

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.080
who became the wife of the First Hokage.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.750
Her name was Mito Uzumaki.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.670
In order to help Lord First Hokage

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.000
who had obtained the Nine Tails in his battle with Madara,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.330
Lady Mito sealed the Nine Tails inside her body

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.630
with a Sealing Jutsu and became its Jinchuriki.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.580
From then on,

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.790
the Hidden Leaf maintained possession of the Nine Tails.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.500
But when Lady Mito's days were coming to an end,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.540
I was brought to Hidden Leaf as the vessel for the Nine Tails.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.920
You were just being used!

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.130
When I was first brought to the village,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.040
I wasn't told a thing.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.500
It was quite a shock when I was told why I was there.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.290
This was a closely guarded secret.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.210
And the only ones who knew

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.170
were the Third Hokage and a few of the top officials.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.170
Not even the Legendary Sannin were told about this.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.380
I was nearly overwhelmed by the pressure of being the Jinchuriki

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.130
and the loneliness I felt.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.250
But Lady Mito, the previous Jinchuriki, summoned me…

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.630
Come closer.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.790
Like you, I was brought here

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.130
to become the vessel for the Nine Tails.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.540
I can imagine your shock when you learned of this.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.080
How sad you must have been.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.540
How you have suffered.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.710
You can tell me the truth.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.500
Yes…

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.000
Now listen carefully.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.670
Indeed, we are the vessels for the Nine Tails.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.420
However, there is a way to find happiness

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.790
even if you must live as a Jinchuriki.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.330
First…

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.880
by filling ourselves.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.000
By filling myself with love first,

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.830
I would be able to live a happy life

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.500
despite being the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.540
That is what Lady Mito taught me.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:15.830
So you were happy even if you were the Jinchuriki, Ma?

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.420
Yes.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.630
Naruto… Now why are you crying?

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.580
Wait…

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.080
What is it?

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.080
That time 16 years ago

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.540
when the Nine Tails attacked Hidden Leaf Village…

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:47.500
Dad said a man wearing an Akatsuki mask was behind it.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.250
So how come you had the Nine Tails, Mom?

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.210
I see that your father didn't tell you all the details.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.040
Of course.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.670
Back then, there was so much going on

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.540
and Minato didn't have much time.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.130
It's true. The fact is that, 16 years ago,

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.790
a masked man was manipulating

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.380
the Nine Tails that attacked the village.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.880
But moments earlier,

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.630
I had the Nine Tails sealed and in my possession.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.670
Then why?

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.920
That masked man.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.040
I don't know how, but that masked man knew…

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.540
Knew what?

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.170
He knew about the one chance he had to weaken the seal,

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.580
which kept the Tailed Beast locked inside the Jinchuriki.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.380
He waited for that moment to steal the Nine Tails.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.580
The one chance to weaken the seal?!

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.170
What was it?

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:49.830
It was childbirth.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.920
During the approximately ten months from the time

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.040
a female Jinchuriki gets pregnant and gives birth,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.670
the Tailed Beast Seal weakens proportionally

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.670
as the energy normally used to maintain the seal

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.080
is diverted to the growing baby.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.500
Then…

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.580
Sixteen years ago…on October 10…

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.670
HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL Congratulations!

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.500
What?

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.290
Your due date is October 10!

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.540
Oh then…yeah!

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.500
Huh? A baby?

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.710
I'm going to be a mother, ya know!

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.130
And I'm going be a father.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.630
A mother, ya know!

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.630
I'm going to be a father!

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.540
A mother, ya know!

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.630
Imagine that, I'm going to be a father!

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.170
Kushina, there is something I must explain to you

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.710
about giving birth.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.000
It happened to Lady Mito, the previous Jinchuriki, too.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.580
During her labor, the Nine Tails' seal was nearly broken.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.580
I'm sorry, but as a precautionary measure,

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.750
we're going to ask you to deliver the child

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.830
somewhere away from the village, inside a barrier.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.540
We have the seal to think of, so I will be accompanying you.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.130
Minato and Taji from the Anbu Black Ops.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.500
Also I will send my wife, Biwako, to be with you.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.130
This is to be done in utmost secrecy.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.710
Naturally, I will assign bodyguards,

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.420
but they will be Anbu Black Ops under my direct orders.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.540
I'll go on ahead and prepare everything.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.130
All right.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.580
I will take you there.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:15.210
Kushina!

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.080
Oh, yes.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:19.630
I appreciate it.

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.750
We should go soon.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:26.670
Yes.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.630
Oh!

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.080
Oh my…

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.540
Was it a girl?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.080
It's a boy.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.380
So cute…

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.080
What's your name?

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.290
It's Sasuke.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.210
Oh, so he was named after father of the Third Hokage!

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.880
Yes, so that he will grow up to be a strong and fine shinobi.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.500
You will be giving birth soon too, right, Kushina?

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.670
You should pick a name in advance.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:09.710
I already have.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.040
His name will be Naruto.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.630
You'll be classmates, Sasuke, so be friends, okay?

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.790
By the way, does it really hurt?

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.500
So there's actually something that scares you, Kushina!

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.130
I'm surprised!

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.670
Let's go, Kushina!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.630
Oh, yes!

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.880
See you again!

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.130
The details of your birthing are supposed to be top secret.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.330
Until we get to our location,

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.750
you must avoid any contact, even with your friends.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.420
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.880
Also, we are leaving the village secretly.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.500
If your labor pains begin, try not to cry out loud!

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.080
Oh…right.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.960
It hurts, ya know!

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.830
BIND I've never seen Kushina in so much pain.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.170
Is she…all right?

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.920
She's all right!

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.670
Never mind that.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.670
Just stay focused on the Nine Tail's seal!

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.420
But she's…

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.580
You are the Fourth Hokage! Act like one!

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.960
A man would have dropped dead from such pain long ago.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.630
But women are strong!

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.250
He's so strong!

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.460
The Nine Tails is struggling to get out!

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.670
Hang in there, Kushina!

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.580
Hang in there, Naruto!

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.380
I can see his head! You're almost there, Kushina!

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.630
Hang on, Kushina!

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.920
Naruto! Come out quickly!

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.830
Nine Tails, you stay put!

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.880
Hot water!

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.710
Right!

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:44.170
Why is Nine Tails—? Was the seal released?

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.540
Do not falter!

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.330
Even if we can't defeat the Nine Tails,

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.210
we must concentrate on evacuating the villagers!

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:54.210
As Hokage, I will protect the village… my family…right now.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.000
This is what I need to do.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.580
Next Time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Fourth Hokage's Death Match!"

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.710
I won't let you!

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:09.460
Tune in again!
