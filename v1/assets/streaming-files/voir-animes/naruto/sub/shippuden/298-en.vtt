00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.530
Iruka… What is it, Lord Hokage?

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.320
I know how you feel.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.830
You grew up just like him… without a parent's love.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.210
Huh? Who could it be at this hour?

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.040
Mizuki Sensei!

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.250
What's wrong?

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.880
Please come to Lord Hokage's office!

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.840
It seems Naruto pulled a prank and stole the Sacred Scroll!

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.760
What?!

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.560
It's been over half a day since the scroll was taken.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.930
Find Naruto immediately!

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.230
Naruto!

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.900
Hurry! Give me the scroll now!

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.480
Mizuki's after the scroll!

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.450
Why…Naruto?

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.370
How did you know that I wasn't Iruka?

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.090
I'm Iruka…

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.340
He's a superior student that I acknowledge.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.640
He perseveres and he's earnest,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.770
but he's clumsy and no one accepts him.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.400
He knows what human suffering is.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.360
He is no longer the monster fox.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.170
He's Hidden Leaf's—!

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.740
That was a dream?

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.860
The Message

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.940
THE THIRD HOKAGE Iruka Sensei, what's this all about?

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.060
THE THIRD HOKAGE Remember, you recorded me before?

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.020
Huh? Oh yeah…

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.780
– That boring message with no style or punch? – Naruto, Hinata…

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.820
Congratulations on your marriage.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.910
C'mon, don't say that. Could you just use that one?

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.160
But you said you wanted to re-do it,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.710
so I've been waiting around this whole time!

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.250
I'm sorry about that.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.790
But the more I think about it,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.630
the less sure I am about what to say to Naruto.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.010
But you held out for so long,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.970
so you should just make up your mind

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.760
and send him a cool, heartfelt message, okay?

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.930
You're the only one left!

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.140
I'm sorry. I'll treat to you a bowl of ramen next time,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.310
so please forgive me!

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.480
Okay?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.230
Hey! Tsukune, Sansho, Mibuna!

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.730
You were messing around with the Third Hokage's statue again, weren't you?!

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.270
NINJA ACADEMY I can't believe it's almost next week…

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.350
Naruto's wedding.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.070
Will you be making an official congratulatory speech?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.860
Oh no… I think Lord Hokage will be taking care of that.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.700
Iruka Sensei!

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.710
Oh, you're Ichiraku's—!

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.210
Is anything the matter?

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.290
You haven't been around at all lately.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.340
Oh, I just wanted to hold off until I figured out

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.470
what to say for the message that Konohamaru asked me to do.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.140
I have to practice some self-restraint.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.350
So…Did you finish your message?

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.970
Well…uh…

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.190
I'll stop by again soon.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.690
Please say hello to your dad.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.320
What? That's easy!

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.370
Then can you jump to here?!

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.950
Oww!

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.910
I knew it.
Shut up!

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.460
I won't lose at fence-jumping though!

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.580
It's all thanks to you.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.960
You acknowledged me back then.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.720
That was the first time.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.050
That's why, I am who I am today.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.810
I was able to change.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.350
Naruto expressed his feelings so directly.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.020
What am I doing?

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.870
Oh man… I really shouldn't do things I'm not used to!

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.420
Huh?

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.050
Yes?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.850
Naruto!

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.230
H-Hey, Iruka Sensei… W-What's wrong?

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.860
Nothing. It's…well… I was thinking about you.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.940
And I just stopped by to see if you were alive!

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.450
What the hell's that about?

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.320
You know, I'm gonna be getting married.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.950
And you're still single and all,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.580
so I was worried about you being alone.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.250
I'm coming in!

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.160
Hey, wait! I'm in the middle of…

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.210
What happened?

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.210
Uh, just some stuff.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.880
But what about you? What's going on?

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.630
Uh…well…

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.050
Oh yeah! R-Ramen!

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.680
Want to go get some ramen?

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.970
Ramen?

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.350
Actually, I'm making dinner right now.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.350
Oh, that explains this crime scene right here.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.940
Y-Yeah…

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.650
You really should hurry up and get married, Iruka Sensei!

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.730
Shut up!

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.570
What about you?

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.990
Are you sure you should be neglecting Hinata right now?

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.700
"Neglecting"?

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.700
We're not married yet, so don't worry about it.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.660
Don't worry about it?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.450
My single days are numbered!

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.250
I'm gonna have fun with everything I've got—

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.710
You fool!

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.210
Do you even have a clue about

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.590
how hard Hinata is working, preparing for your wedding?!

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.880
What's wrong, Iruka Sensei?

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.470
It seems there were a lot of things

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.100
I failed to teach you on how to be a human!

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.140
I take full responsibility!

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.600
Come with me!

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.440
I'm gonna knock some sense into you!

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.310
Huh?

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.230
Where are we going, Iruka Sensei?!

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.820
To Hinata's!

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.110
I'm going to apologize to her

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.200
for raising you into such a thoughtless man.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.660
Please stop!

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.200
If Hinata's around, I won't be able to say

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.490
what I wanted to talk to you about!

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.120
What do you want to talk about?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.670
T-That's why I thought we could have some ramen,

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.550
and you could have a drink or two…

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.550
and we could have an enjoyable conversation and

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:12.800
have some fun.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.930
Enough.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.810
I guess I didn't need to mull over

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.310
what to say and how to congratulate you.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.450
I have a request…

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.700
A request?

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.460
Will you attend the ceremony as my father?

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.840
Naruto…?

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.970
Is that what you wanted to talk about?

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.740
You can leave it to me!

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.280
Iruka Sensei!

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.410
Thank you.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.830
What are you talking about, Naruto?

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.540
I should be saying that. Thank you!

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.840
Cut it out.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.920
See you later, Iruka Sensei!

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.260
Yeah!

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.860
ICHIRAKU

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.480
Good evening…

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.200
– Hey! – Oh… – Welcome! – What's going on?

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.990
Something troublin' you again?

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.620
Huh? No…

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.870
I was just thinking about how glad I am I chose this profession.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.290
I see.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.330
So, what'll you have today?

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.170
Oh! A large miso char siu ramen topped with naruto fishcake.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.050
One large miso char siu ramen!

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.010
Okay, one large-size miso char siu ramen coming right up!

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.150
Hinata!

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.030
Iruka Sensei?

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.320
How are the preparations going?

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.360
Just about all done.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.280
Now, we just have to wait for the big day.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.200
That's good.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.240
Anyway, I… have something to tell you.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.290
It's about the wedding ceremony…

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.170
You're going to attend as Naruto's father, aren't you?

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.670
Oh, you knew?

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.460
Yeah, of course you would!

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.720
Seems it was on Naruto's mind for a long time.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.060
You're definitely Naruto's teacher, Iruka Sensei.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.560
But he didn't want to consider your relationship

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.480
simply as a "student-teacher" or "mentor" relationship.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.190
Huh?!

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.190
But I kind of feel like it shouldn't be coming

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.570
from the point of view of a teacher to his student.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.150
Naruto was thinking the same thing as I was.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.950
And so, his answer was to ask me to attend as his father.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.410
Yes.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.040
And so, please continue to support him, Father!

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.880
Y-Yes…

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.340
It's sort of embarrassing to be asked so formally.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.600
So anyway…

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.600
What is this?

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.190
It's not much, but please put it toward the reception fees.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.270
What?!

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.440
Naruto asked me to stand in as his father.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.650
I have to do this much, at least.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.240
Please don't worry about that!

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.530
Please!

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.160
I-Is that so?

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.080
I guess I'll just have to accept your answer

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.540
and wait for the big day.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.330
I wish I could've done something fatherly though…

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.590
W-What is it?

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.220
You look just like my father, with that expression.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.720
You're already acting like the father of the groom.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.140
Y-You think so?

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.400
3…2…

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.110
1…

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.650
Rolling!

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.320
NINJA ACADEMY Naruto, Hinata…

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.110
NINJA ACADEMY Congratulations on your wedding!

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.370
Naruto!

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.960
What's the matter, Iruka Sensei?

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.120
Lost for words again?

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.790
Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.630
This time, I'll do it right!

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.340
So can I start over, just one more time?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.220
A PERFECT DAY FOR A CELEBRATION

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.970
Naruto, Hinata… Congratulations on your wedding!

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.310
Please create a home as bright as the morning sun!

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.440
May you always be happy!

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.330
Stop by once in a while for miso char siu ramen, okay?

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.000
Congratulations, you two.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.130
Congratulations!

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.510
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WEDDING! LEAF'S UNOFFICIAL MASCOT CONGRATULATIONS Naruto, Miss Hinata… A lot of things have happened,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.710

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.050
Big Brother Naruto, you did it!

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.760
I'm gonna do my best too!

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.430
Naruto Uzumaki, congratulations on your wedding.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.720
Dear Naruto, do your best.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.350
Yeah!

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.310
FIRE

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.020
Naruto, Hinata… Congratulations on your wedding!

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.900
Help each other and may you have long lasting happiness!

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:12.700
NINJA ACADEMY Naruto! Hinata! Congratulations on your wedding!

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.120
Hinata, Naruto is absent-minded and reckless

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.080
and will need your support.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.880
I ask you to please take care of him!

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.800
Naruto, I just have this to say to you…

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.010
You better make Hinata happy!

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.810
Okay! That was perfect!

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.600
Phew… It went without a hitch!

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.740
UZUMAKI-HYUGA WEDDING RECEPTION

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.120
Uh… Could you get the receiving desk set up?

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.160
Lord Kakashi!

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.830
Like I said, drop the "lord."

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.340
The Lords Kage have arrived.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.090
Huh? Already?!

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.960
Shall I escort them?

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.170
Yes. It's rude to keep them waiting.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.010
Huh?

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.050
Hey, Kazekage entourage!

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:17.100
We're the Lightning entourage… Here to give our wedding blessings.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.480
So forget the past… Let's be friends 'til the last.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.850
Of course!

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.360
I don't feel like fighting like brats anymore.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.780
Oh say, see my gift and be surprised

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.570
Even the couple will rapturize.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:29.570
Enough already!

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.070
The reception desk is now open.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.700
– Hey, where'd Temari go? – Please sign in, in order of arrival.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.200
I haven't seen her since we came.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.830
EBISU

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.080
How much are you giving them, Ebisu Sensei?

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.500
Well, it's accepted etiquette for working adults like us

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.920
to give about… Huh?!

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.630
It's okay to give that little?

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.760
I put five bills in my envelope.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.800
What?!

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.800
Did you say five?!

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.930
I'll lose face as a teacher.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.890
You mean, our wedding gift?

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.850
We'll be giving… FREE NARUTO FISHCAKE TOPPING …this!

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.940
Not that one, Dad!

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.860
Huh? Oh…this one.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.530
Seriously?

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.360
Now listen, Lee!

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.160
When we honor people, we hone our mind and spirit.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.120
That's what a reception's for!

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.540
What you mean is, to never forget to train, even at a party!

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.000
Naturally!

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.500
Look, people are staring like you're weird, so will you cut it out?

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.170
We'll start with dumbbell juggling! Let's go!

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.750
Yes, Guy Sensei!

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.550
What a day! What a joyous day!

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.970
Yes! This training is especially joyous!

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.100
You two have too much joy in your heads!

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.440
So? Did you get a hold of the honey wine?

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.690
Of course!

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.190
We're gonna tell Naruto about the history of the Senju Clan.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.860
You're that versed in history to do that?

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:58.530
Huh?! Well, yeah… Why don't you run it by me first?

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.290
Well, that's…uh.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.540
Giddy up!

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:02.950
Run!

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.370
Mirai, what are you doing?

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.000
Playing horsey-back!

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.960
Akamaru is a dog.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.710
You can't ride a dog and call it horsey-back riding.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.710
Then, doggie-back riding!

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:17.220
True, it is doggie-back riding. But Akamaru looks a little tired.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.600
You might want to come down.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.390
It's because… No! I wanna ride some more!

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.060
I guess I have no choice.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.100
Let's go Shino-back riding, then.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.610
– Was Shino always that good with little kids? – Higher! Higher!

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.740
Seems he thinks he might be suited to teaching.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.030
What are you smiling about?

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.120
Who said I was smiling?

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.330
Whatever… Men go to wedding receptions

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.960
to meet the friends of the bride, don't they?

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.210
That's not it.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.880
What a drag! Let's go over there.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.960
Hey!

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.800
Oh, sweet!

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.140
It's definitely gonna be sweet.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.850
When did they hook up?

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.680
Who are you talking about?

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.310
Shikamaru and Temari…

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.150
Did you know they were like that?

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.060
Hmm.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:14.650
Anyway, everyone probably thinks about us the same way.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.630
CONGRATULATIONS

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.970
Sasuke…

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.360
What's the matter, Iruka Sensei?

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.740
Is something still worrying you?

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.030
Well…

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.910
It's going to be all right.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.040
Thanks to you, Iruka Sensei,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.710
we have guard duty covered with enough shinobi.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.420
No, that was all you, Kakashi.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.130
No, I didn't do anything.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.970
I just helped a little.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.640
It's all thanks to the bonds Naruto forged.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.600
Naruto's here, and that's why everyone is here today.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.560
I'm sure he will make Hinata happy.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.310
Are you still worried?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.150
Well…

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.030
I forgot to prepare my final message.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.710
Brother Neji… I'm going to get married.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.900
Elder Sister! It's time!

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:15.980
All right!

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.820
Wow!

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.940
You look so beautiful, Elder Sister!

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.690
Doesn't she, Father?

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.060
Okay, ready to go?

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.900
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WEDDING!

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:38.850
THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT!

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:40.960
Naruto to Boruto!

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.840
A new story with Naruto's son Boruto finally begins!

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.590
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.830
Starting April 5th Wednesday 5:55 PM

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:16.540
