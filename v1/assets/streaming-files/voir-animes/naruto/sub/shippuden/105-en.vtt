WEBVTT

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.910
Protect?

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.550
Did you say protect?!

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.580
You've got to be kidding!

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.510
I'll say it once more...

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.550
You think you know about your brother, but you know nothing.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.550
If you continue speaking such nonsense, I'll kill you!

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.610
You're not making this easy, are you?

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.080
I suppose that's natural though...

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.080
Suddenly being told such a story by a stranger like me.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.710
But what I tell you is the truth.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.080
Itachi did mention it, did he not? About his accomplice that night.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.780
I am that  Madara Uchiha.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.580
I know everything about Itachi.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.710
I suppose Itachi died without realizing that.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.580
Shut up! Such things don't matter anymore!

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.580
Just get out of my sight!

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.980
No, you will listen. You need to hear this.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.650
It's your obligation!

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.750
For the sake of the ninja world...

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.650
For the sake of the Hidden Leaf Village...

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.450
And for your sake...

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.710
Your brother risked everything. You will know how Itachi Uchiha lived!

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.080
Do you know why?

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.980
Why Itachi implanted Amaterasu into your eye?

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.480
Itachi was determined to make sure that you and I would not meet.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.980
You will understand why, as well as everything else,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.150
when you hear me out.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.480
Those who knew the truth about Itachi

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.280
were Danzo of the Hidden Leaf, the Third Hokage,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.810
and his advisors Homura and Koharu. Just those four.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.810
The Third Hokage died... and now, there are only three aging folk.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.550
Still, those three will probably never reveal the abominable truth.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.750
The truth about Itachi will fade into darkness forever.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.550
And that is what Itachi wished.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.880
However, I know the truth about Itachi too.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.080
As I said earlier... Itachi died without realizing that.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.410
However, he wanted to make doubly sure.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.380
It seems Itachi did not trust me.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.510
So just in case I did know the truth,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.750
he planned to silence me with the Amaterasu.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.150
He probably anticipated I would show my Sharingan

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.850
in order to speak to you.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.350
What is this?

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.980
What is this guy saying?

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.950
Protect me?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.450
Protect?!

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.580
The truth?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.750
Think back.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.250
Think carefully and remember about Itachi.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.510
About your kind brother.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.380
What's wrong?

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.880
This is it, right? The place where Father works.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.480
This is the headquarters of the Hidden Leaf Police Force.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.480
I've always been curious.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.450
Why is the Uchiha crest on the police force logo?

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.510
What? You noticed that?

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.910
Who wouldn't?

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.550
Well...let's see...

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.910
Simply put, it seems our ancestors formed and organized this police force.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.850
And so, they used our family crest as the symbol of this organization.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.150
From ages past,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.710
our clan has been entrusted with the safety of the village.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.910
The Uchiha crest reflects the pride of our clan.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.480
While its numbers have dwindled,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.550
even today, nearly everyone in the clan serves on Squad One

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.880
and is dedicated to preserving the peace and safety of the village.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.210
After all, only exceptional ninja are capable of preventing crimes that ninja commit.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.480
Father is great, after all!

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.180
Are you going to work here too?

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.750
I wonder about that...

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.250
You should!

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.110
No, he...

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.450
He tried to kill me!

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.550
He tried to take my eyes...

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.280
Who would do such a thing?!

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.350
Foolish little brother...

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.150
Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.780
Calm down!

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.410
Breathe slowly.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.010
Don't touch me!

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.210
Even if you do hate me...

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.050
That's what big brothers are for.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.010
Sorry, Sasuke... Another time.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:30.450
Fate

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.150
You're awake...

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.810
Sorry, but I took the liberty of tying you up.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.010
Since you weren't gonna stay still and listen to me.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.150
He... Itachi was my enemy.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.080
He killed our parents... He killed everyone in the clan.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.980
He was a Rogue Ninja... A member of the Akatsuki...

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.810
He was despicable.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.310
He was my target.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.480
It's true...

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.050
that he annihilated the Uchiha clan that night.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.310
And he deserted the Hidden Leaf.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.880
Then...

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.780
And that is what he was ordered to do by the Hidden Leaf.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.350
That is the beginning of the truth about Itachi.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.750
It was his mission?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:34.880
Yes.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.350
That night,

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.080
Itachi killed his personal feelings and fulfilled his mission.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.280
It seems you've calmed down a bit.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.480
What are you talking about?!

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.580
In order to talk about Itachi,

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.580
I must take you back to the early days when Hidden Leaf Village was founded.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.550
Itachi sacrificed himself.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.550
This is fate that has continued since ages past.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.250
He was sacrificed for it.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.010
Sacrifice?

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.180
That's correct.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:15.750
A huge problem rooted since the time Hidden Leaf Village was founded.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.710
That is what determined Itachi's life.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.410
It's a long story, but everything I tell you is the truth.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.510
On what basis should I believe you?

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.910
You're untrustworthy.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.380
There's nothing I can show you as proof.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.910
And it's up to you whether you believe me or not.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.710
But you will hear me out until I finish.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.010
Fine... So talk.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.910
It all started more than 80 years ago.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.750
The world was in turmoil. It was the age of war.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.350
Nations battled for power and to increase their territories.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.150
During this age of war,

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.380
ninjas consisted of individual clans serving as armed units.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.650
They were hired by various nations to participate in the fighting.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:40.810
And among the many ninja clans, two were feared as the strongest.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.080
One was us, the Uchiha clan.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.380
And the other was known as the Forest's Senju Clan.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.080
We of the Uchiha clan possessed exceptional chakra and the Sharingan.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:58.180
Excelling in all types of warfare, we became known as a battle clan.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.280
And I was born into the Uchiha clan,

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.550
possessing chakra that was especially powerful.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.210
Perhaps the fact that I've lived this long is proof of that.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.180
Back in those days, all I did was battle.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.380
In an age defined by power,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.750
I sought to become ever stronger

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.450
and killed my friends and even my younger brother.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.150
Why you...!

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.550
As a result, I came into possession of the perfect Mangekyo Sharingan,

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.950
and became the leader of the Uchiha.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.810
And using that power, I fought the Senju clan countless times.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:44.750
It was inevitable that I face Hashirama, the leader of the Senju clan.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.810
"Wood Style" Hashirama Senju, the future first Hokage.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.750
The one who stood at the top of the ninja world...

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.380
And the one I respected most.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.250
The Senju clan, led by Hashirama who became the First Hokage,

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:13.110
was feared and respected by all the other clans.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.450
If the Senju moved, so did the Uchiha.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.310
Our clan was probably the only clan able to compete with them.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.880
If a nation hired the Senju,

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.810
the opposing nation would hire the Uchiha.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.410
We were like rivals.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.350
The more I went up against Hashirama,

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.650
the more my name became known as well.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:40.050
To get close to the top... to measure my abilities...

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.850
To heighten your reputation...

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.050
You took your younger brother's eyes just for that?!

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.350
I did take them.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.280
But I needed power in order to protect the Uchiha.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.410
Protect?

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.450
Yes. As the Uchiha name spread, its enemies increased.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.650
It was a necessary sacrifice to protect the clan

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.210
during the fierce fighting with the Senju, and the other clans.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.610
It was not for my fame.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.350
My younger brother was in total agreement

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.050
and offered his eyes to me.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:31.910
But one day, the Senju clan offered a truce.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.810
And the Uchiha accepted it.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.950
Everyone, in both clans, had grown weary of the fighting

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.350
that had dragged on for so long.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.980
They had enough.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:50.410
But I... I was the only one who opposed it.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.150
Where has all the hate gone?!

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.010
For what purpose had my brother sacrificed himself?!

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.180
The Uchiha and Senju are like oil and water.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.780
I couldn't help fearing that in time,

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.650
the Uchiha clan would come to be oppressed by the Senju clan.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:24.480
However...everyone in the Uchiha clan wanted a truce.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:29.750
As their leader, I had no choice but to go along with their wishes.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:38.010
Shortly thereafter, the ninja alliance signed a pact with the Land of Fire,

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.310
which had sought dominion over the territories.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.380
The secure one nation, one village system was formed

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.710
and became the Land of Fire and the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.610
Other countries adopted the one nation, one village system.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.610
And subsequently, the fires of war were extinguished.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.850
Momentary peace.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.950
But due to a certain incident,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.010
the Hidden Leaf Village quickly descended into turmoil.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.850
A certain incident?

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.950
A fight...for the First Hokage's seat.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.150
As you know, the first to occupy that seat was Hashirama Senju.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.180
The Land of Fire and the entire clan chose Hashirama.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.750
It was inevitable

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.510
that the Uchiha's hold on the reins of power would loosen.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:34.450
I decided that the Uchiha should take leadership...

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.310
That we should confront Hashirama...

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.450
But no one, not even from the Uchiha clan, supported me.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.880
My subordinates, who did not wish to light the fires of war,

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.980
were unsympathetic and betrayed me.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.850
I was accused of acting out of greed and self-interest.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.180
Not only that... They scorned me as a selfish brother

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.810
who stole his younger brother's eyes in order to save his own.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.180
What brother would willfully hurt his younger brother?!

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.010
I just...I just wanted to protect the Uchiha!

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.510
I left the village.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.410
Everyone betrayed me.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:29.680
I became an avenger and declared war on the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.580
And I lost...

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.610
At that place which became known as the Final Valley.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.780
I was said...to have died there.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.980
Even Hashirama believed it.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:06.010
And everyone forgot about me... History forgot about me.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.310
Hashirama's younger brother who became the Second Hokage

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.850
was determined that there would never be a traitor like me again.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.480
So, as proof of his trust, he granted the Uchiha a special position...

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.750
And he created the Hidden Leaf Police Force.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.780
But the truth is...

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.080
This was to further distance the Uchiha from the reins of government.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.710
Furthermore, it was a way to keep a close eye on the entire clan.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.780
There were Uchiha members who realized this...

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.680
Members who wanted to carry on my rebellion.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.280
But...it was too late.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.610
Time passed...

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.980
The Senju clan solidified its hold on power

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.780
and the Uchiha fell to becoming Senju dogs.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.280
And what I predicted came to pass.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:01.010
A certain other incident sealed Uchiha's figurative demise.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.450
Yes...

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.080
The attack of the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon 16 years ago.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.010
What do you mean?

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.110
The Nine-Tails can only be tamed and controlled

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.910
by the ocular powers of the Uchiha.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.850
The higher-ups of Hidden Leaf Village perceived the Uchiha

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.650
to be behind this attack.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.910
That was a natural occurrence, a natural calamity.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.680
The Uchiha had nothing to do with it.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.150
Yet suspicion fell on them...

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.850
That the Uchiha had revolted and sought to take power.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.780
As a result, the Uchiha was put under

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.910
the strict surveillance of the Anbu Black Ops,

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.880
and they were forced to relocate to the outskirts of the village.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.110
They became totally estranged.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.480
The Third Hokage was the only one to voice opposition to our treatment.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.550
But Danzo of the Anbu Black Ops

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.380
and the rest of the councilors would not listen.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.110
In the end, the Uchiha clan was not trusted.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.510
And the discrimination began...

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.180
Their distrust bred hatred

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.010
and eventually, their suspicions became reality.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:35.180
The Uchiha clan plotted a coup d'état to take over the village...

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:42.680
The higher-ups in Hidden Leaf Village planted a spy within the Uchiha clan.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.610
That spy was your older brother...

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.750
Itachi Uchiha.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.180
From that moment, Itachi's suffering began.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.710
You laid false charges against the Uchiha!

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.910
That's Itachi's lie.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:45.180
I won't believe it! Itachi tried to kill me!

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.380
If he really wanted to, you certainly would be dead. However...

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.680
Stop it! I've had enough!

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:54.110
You should know why. Because you are...

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.310
Next time, on Naruto Shippuden: "Truth"

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.410
That is Itachi's truth.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.610
Tune in again!
