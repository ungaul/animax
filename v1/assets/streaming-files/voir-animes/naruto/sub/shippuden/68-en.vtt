00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.930
SARUTOBI ASUMA

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.600
Asuma...

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.200
Uncle Asuma...

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.890
Where is Shikamaru?

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.370
I thought my mom said that he left already...

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.530
Hey, I told you not to play on the roof!

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.260
- Yes. - I'm sorry.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.730
BARBE-Q Oh, Shikamaru!

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.820
Oh hello.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.100
I haven't seen you in a while, have you been busy?

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.570
Yeah.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.920
Come by again.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.200
Say "Hi" to Asuma Sensei and Choji for me.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.760
Oh yeah, I have to ask Sensei to pay off his balance.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.790
Um... Asuma is...

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.790
Huh?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.760
He died in duty.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.870
Then, so the one that died yesterday...

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.970
This can't be...

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.000
Shikamaru...

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.300
It's almost dinner...

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.030
It's okay. I don't feel like eating.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.700
Shikamaru.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.970
Come with me for a sec.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.000
You're pretty forceful today.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.370
You can't win that way.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.100
Shut up.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.300
Akatsuki, huh? Are they...strong?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.530
Yeah.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.130
So, what are you going to do?

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.670
If Asuma couldn't beat them, then you won't be able to do anything.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.500
He was a really good guy.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.000
Yeah.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.900
He sucked at Shogi, though.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.670
Are you sure about that?

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.030
Don't mess with my move.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.100
Not that. What do you want to do?

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.730
Well, I guess you're not stupid enough to go die.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.030
As a parent, that is very fortunate that.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.170
Who wants to go to their son's funeral?

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.130
You are doing well. I am proud to be your parent.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.830
You're sharp, and you're talented.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.770
You are capable of taking on the future of Hidden Leaf Village.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.370
But...

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.430
Asuma died.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.830
What are you trying to say?

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.500
The truth.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.970
It's repulsive that you're talking so much!

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.300
Yes, I am just a useless coward!

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.830
No.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.330
Then what?!

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.970
Just let it all out.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.270
Let out all your sadness, fears, and anger...

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:27.200
and everything else!

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.000
And it all starts from there...

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.330
I'll pick up your pieces...

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.430
HIDDEN LEAF LIBRARY

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:58.930
Hello!

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:00.470
Hey!

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.430
Shikamaru!

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:03.770
Hello...

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.570
It must have been hard to deal with what happened to Asuma...

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.830
I don't know what to say...

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.770
Choji is also... Shikamaru.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.530
You...

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.100
You want to see Choji, right?

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.130
He's by the hill in the back.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:33.930
Sheesh!

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.670
Looks like you dug deep.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.370
Huh?! Shikamaru!

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.970
Your mom told me to give you this.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.770
So, when?

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:35.400
You are gonna do it, right?!

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.200
What should I do?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.370
Umm...are you telling me...

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.500
Then, can I ask you to do something for me?

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.300
Yeah!

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.100
YAMANAKA FLOWERS

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.530
Shikamaru!

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:14.830
You're gonna do it right?!

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.670
SARUTOBI ASUMA

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:47.770
Thank you.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.370
Sorry I'm late...

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.400
But I won't hesitate anymore.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:33.500
We might be trying to do something really risky...

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.630
Please look after us...

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.470
Asuma Sensei...

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.030
Asuma Sensei...

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.630
Asuma...Sensei.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.660
Are you ready?

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.020
Let's go, Shikamaru.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:33.460
Yeah.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.390
Wait!

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.790
Lady Fifth Hokage...

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.920
Where are you going?

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.520
The mission order is still on right?

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.260
We formed a new team and we are going to execute the mission.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.490
I will not allow selfish actions!

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.330
Shikamaru, I will have you join the new unit I form.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.990
Then, I will have you go after we come up with a solid plan.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.690
Just send some support later.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.490
Our team has already come up with a plan.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.790
Enough!

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.120
Asuma is dead. There are only three of you now.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.490
Asuma is with us.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.870
Are you planning to avenge him in this battle?

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.660
It's not like you. Do you want to die in vain?!

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.120
We are not that stupid. I have no intention to die...

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:38.870
But...

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.760
But...what?

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.890
I don't want to give up without setting things straight...

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.960
I don't want to live a crappy life like that.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.190
Grow up...

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.290
Death always haunts Ninja...

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.190
There are times when you can't accept a death.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.390
But, if you do not overcome it, then there is no future!

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.220
This keepsake lighter.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.960
When I have this, it's as if Asuma Sensei is nearby...

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.420
It's as if he is protecting us. It just feels that way.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.460
Until this battle comes to an end, this lighter will always be with us...

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:37.990
Get real.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.160
There are only three of you. A unit should have four members--!

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.100
It's fine if there are four, right?

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.870
- Huh? - Kakashi Sensei?

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:50.890
I will join as the captain of Team Ten. How about that?

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.760
Kakashi, you...

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.190
Even if you try to stop them, they're still gonna go.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.830
But if I go, I can supervise them...

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.490
I will not allow them to go overboard.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.870
I got it. Do as you like!

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:27.690
All right!

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.120
Kakashi Sensei... How about Naruto?

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.020
Your right arm...?

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.560
Forget it, he doesn't need me at this point.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.600
Plus, there is another captain with them.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.290
Naruto...

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.330
Well then, Team Asuma, let's go!

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.290
- Right! - Yes!

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.920
I appreciate it, Kakashi Sensei!

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.370
So, we are now going to confront the Akatsuki.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.630
But first, Shikamaru, let me hear your plan.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:48.100
Yes, now that you've joined, I want to change the plan a bit.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.170
I got it. Please explain.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.770
I will explain by dividing it into several different scenarios.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.970
Depending on the situation,

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.130
we will apply different maneuvers, so be sure you listen carefully.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.370
- Got it! - Got it!

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.400
Next time: "Target: Locked On"
