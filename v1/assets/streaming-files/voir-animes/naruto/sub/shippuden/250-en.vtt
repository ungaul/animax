WEBVTT

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.190
Good…

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.070
Naruto!

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.480
Stop, Madara!

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.980
I already told you that you had little time left.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.820
Obito…

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.530
He's reluctant to give up the Rinnegan to Madara…

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.110
You stubborn fool… You're almost dead anyway!

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.940
Hang in there! Don't give up!

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.400
You're strong! You'll pull through!

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.480
My chakra's almost all…

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.440
Sasuke's not good, he's really gonna…

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.570
At this rate, Naruto's going to…

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.530
– die! – die!

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.530
On the Brink of Death

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.990
The Nine Tails' chakra…

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.370
No heartbeat or pulse...

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.950
No way!

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.580
Hang in there, Naruto!

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.740
What's going on?!

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.530
My Medical Ninjutsu isn't working on him!

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.330
It's probably because the Nine Tails has been extracted from him!

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.580
That's impossible!

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.950
Madara got him.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.030
But there's a way to save him!

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.450
That's why we're hurrying!

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.660
To where?!

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.780
To where the Fourth Hokage is.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.780
Hey, kid! Kazekage! Do me a favor!

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.830
His father…

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.910
One-half of me is sealed inside the Fourth Hokage, Minato.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.740
So transplant that other half into Naruto. That will save him.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.240
Hurry to the Fourth Hokage!

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.910
He has the Teleportation Jutsu.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.200
Can't we just contact him over there somehow and have him come here?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.370
That won't work!

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.530
His Teleportation Jutsu is written into my Sealing Formula.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.700
Once I'm extracted, it will disappear…

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.240
Just rush Naruto over to the Fourth Hokage.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.410
Got that, Gaara?!

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.740
Kid Kazekage… I'm counting on you!

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.910
That's what Nine Tails told me.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.870
Right now, there's no other way to save Naruto!

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.160
How much longer 'til we get there?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.700
Several kilometers!

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.620
I'll do whatever it takes with what little chakra I have left!

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.910
All right!

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.490
As long as I'm here, I am not going to let you die!

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.910
I'm going to go at full speed!

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.120
Right!

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.280
If I could just…save his soul with my Forbidden Jutsu…

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.700
I can't sense any chakra in him anymore.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.450
I can't even move my body… let alone use Teleportation.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.030
Damn you, Madara!

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.700
Karin just went charging ahead!

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.700
Let's go back up Karin!

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.780
Shouldn't we wait for an opening, or have some sort of plan?

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.830
Whoa, you're not getting past me.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.200
No one's answered my question yet.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.200
Don't get in my way!

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.700
I'm going to Sasuke!

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.700
Move, you bastard!

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.120
You've got to be kidding! Karin is amazing.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.280
What is this?!

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.240
The same power as Kushina Uzumaki's.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.740
After all this time, she's finally attained it…

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.200
Oh no… You just broke my little toy!

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.780
Do not…underestimate me!

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.740
Double Blast!

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.530
Not bad.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.870
I can't move…

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.160
A Curse Mark!

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.530
Too bad!

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.280
A-Amazing…

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.450
Orochimaru…They got past it!

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.700
It's no big deal.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.030
It's too late even if you go over there anyway.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.080
But as for you guys… I'm going to take you down.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.700
Stop your ogling!

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.240
We must go too.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.870
Still…who is he?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.870
Are you all right, Karin?

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.450
Yeah… But never mind me.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.830
Sasuke! I can't sense Sasuke!

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.080
So this is Six Paths power…

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.870
Now, for that left eye.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.990
I'm a super elite ninja who's gonna be the Hokage someday…

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.740
Remember my name… Naruto Uzumaki!

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.370
I'm gonna become the Hokage!

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.780
The Hokage that surpasses all previous Hokage, ya know!

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.870
That silly dream you once had… no longer seems silly.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.620
I will not let you die!

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.780
You're not going to die, no matter what!

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.370
Your dream… is right before your eyes now!

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.490
Who's there?!

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.680
Depending on the situation,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.630
Orochimaru might try to steal Sasuke's body.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:56.220
It's what Kimimaro had wanted, but I doubt Karin would allow it.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.470
There's someone else where Sasuke is.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.430
Do you recognize the chakra?

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.130
No! But…

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.010
But what?

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.380
This chakra… has a real nasty feel to it!

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.340
Then we need to hurry even more.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:25.800
We don't know what this stranger might do to Sasuke.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.550
Is this the end for him?

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.840
Damn it…

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.470
Yikes!

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.590
Karin! If you up the pace too much, you're going to collapse soon.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.380
Let's head to the others with youth power to the max!

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.720
Lee! Tenten!

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.300
Yes, sir! But you're falling over, Guy Sensei!

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.630
Your body isn't keeping up with your spirit!

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.050
That's Gaara's sand… I think I saw Sakura too…

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.380
Why are they retreating?

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.720
Kakashi hasn't overtaken and passed us yet, has he?

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.930
No.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.430
The Nine Tails' chakra we got from Naruto has disappeared.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.510
And Sakura, a Medical Ninja, is on the move…

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.010
I have a feeling something is going down on Kakashi's side.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.260
We're heading back, Lee! Tenten!

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.300
My red-hot blood is boiling!

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.430
It must be a super premonition!

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.800
Nothing good can come out of being stuck with

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.340
this hot-blooded, airhead duo!

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.180
Neji, why did you leave me?

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.840
Okay, let's head back.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.260
You want to go back, right? Fine, let's do that.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.800
Neji…

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.260
I'm never going to forgive you.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.840
Wait for me! I'll be there as fast as I can, Kakashi.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.510
Hurry, Kakashi…the left eye.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.970
Obito's conscience is clear. Now's our chance.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.090
The problem is how to tear Obito away from that guy.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.880
And we can't hand over that left eye to the enemy…

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.760
I feel a little heavy.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.470
There's something catching in my chest.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.880
The Sage of Six Paths' Ninja Tools, eh?

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.380
Useless.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.220
But now I'm lighter.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.680
What will we accomplish by returning now?

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.430
Tenten, don't grumble!

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.260
I just have this gut feeling that some unknown horror is approaching.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.340
Yes, sir.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.220
Are you two all right?!

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.800
Yes…!

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.510
No way… These are definitely the—!

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.630
You guys are stubborn too!

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.380
Obito's consciousness is no longer stable.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.050
Let's go, Kakashi.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.470
Hold on, Minato!

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.630
Switch your chakra to Sensory Mode!

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.680
No way!

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.010
We were distracted by what was happening here.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.380
There's no mistake.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.300
My other half has already been extracted!

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.220
Sensei?

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.430
Kakashi Sensei!

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.720
What happened?

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.340
The Nine Tails was extracted from Naruto!

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:26.930
At this rate he'll—!

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.510
Naruto…

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.180
Fourth Hokage, I bring a message from Naruto's Nine Tails!

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.380
He said to transplant the other half of Nine Tails

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.340
that you have within you, into Naruto!

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.510
That will save him!

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.760
Oh…

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.300
Kakashi, he's yours.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.510
I understand.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.220
I'll help!

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.680
I'm going.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.340
Be careful.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.300
Of course! I'm not dying until I see my child's face.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.880
Once this baby is born…

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.300
I'll have two things to worry about.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:35.510
Don't worry!

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.720
I'll protect the kid!

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.840
No matter what happens, and no matter what it takes!

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.300
But you're busy being Hokage,

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.720
and I get the feeling he's going to be mischievous and unreasonable

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.840
and say he wants to be the Hokage…

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.260
– He'll be clueless about girls… – Hey, wait!

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.380
– And he'll defy his teachers! And… – Hold on!

00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:00.550
The child's not even born yet… You're worrying too much!

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.430
Besides, how do you know it's a boy?

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.930
Or that he'll want to be the Hokage even before it's born?

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.880
Because…

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.470
I'm his mother.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.470
In any case, I'm the Hokage.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.380
And I'm not going to die easily.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.590
And no matter what happens to me,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.510
I, the Hokage, will protect the child.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.970
Don't worry!

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.800
You're quite confident when it comes to this baby!

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.630
Well, of course…

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:35.470
I'm his father.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.470
The current me can…

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.340
This time for sure!

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:05.930
What?

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.340
That's—!

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.300
Nine Tails…

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:17.010
You're finally mine!

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.300
What happened?!

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.090
How's Naruto?!

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.220
What was that?

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.800
No way…

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.930
Lord Madara…

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.880
You're late, Black Zetsu…

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.510
I decided to come to you!

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.630
Madara, I need to ask you something.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.420
What am I to you?

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.250
You're kidding, right?

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.420
What kind of stupid question is that, to ask at this point in time?

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.000
You are only one thing to me.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.460
You are he who rejects this world,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.380
who holds that thought in his heart and strives toward a goal.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.130
