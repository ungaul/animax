WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.230
You won't get away...this time...

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.170
Here he comes!

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.200
- Right! - Right!

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.400
He's fast!

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.370
Damn it!

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.600
I can't move.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.370
Kakashi Hatake...

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.030
I was planning to replace the hearts I lost with yours...

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.000
but I changed my mind.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.600
I can get more hearts anytime I want, after all...

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.630
Die!

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.770
Wind Style: Rasengan!

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.100
Water Style: Ripping Torrent!

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.400
- Hurricane Vortex Jutsu! - Hurricane Vortex Jutsu!

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.870
Sorry...we're late.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.030
Perfect timing...

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.730
Thanks for the support...

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.100
Sakura...Sai...and Naruto.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.970
I've never seen you this beat.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.700
Sorry about that.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.670
This enemy...must be pretty strong.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.730
When You Curse Someone, You Dig Your Own Grave

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.300
More strange people...

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.130
And he is pretty messed up already...

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.430
Naruto, are you okay?

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.730
Where is Shikamaru?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.900
He's a little ways off fighting the other enemy.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.630
I want two of you to head towards Shikamaru.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.530
Preferably, a long-distance fighter and a medic.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.270
I'll take care of it.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.270
All right!

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.600
Sai and Sakura follow Pakkun's lead and support Shikamaru!

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.630
Yes!

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.230
Yes.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.330
Hah! What's this unorganized gang trying to do?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.200
Now there're more hearts for me to choose from.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.730
From here on, this one's mine.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.070
Naruto...

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.330
We're off!

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.930
Naruto, I leave it to you!

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.830
Did you...complete it?

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.830
No...only about 50 percent.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.330
I see...

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.370
But...

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.200
Well, just watch.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.370
Naruto is not the same person he used to be.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.130
This way!

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.370
Either way... To go against an opponent who killed Asuma alone...

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.800
Is Shikamaru-kun... I mean, Shikamaru going to be all right?

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.470
Shikamaru is fine.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.830
He is...the most intelligent Shinobi in the Land of Fire.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.900
Plus...

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.370
Okay... Well then, let's go.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.130
Sheesh... He has absolutely no interest.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.900
I can't believe he's a sub-captain.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.930
Don't say that. It's difficult for him to show any interest.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.670
In fact, I bet he hates showing it.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.400
He's trying really hard to show disinterest.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:37.070
I don't get it... Lady Tsunade, aren't you overrating him?

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.500
I think I am still underrating him...

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.400
This is...?

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.630
We recently received an official offer from a Feudal Lord in the Land of Fire...

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.970
They want Shikamaru as a member of the Feudal Lord's personal guard division.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.670
It seems Shikamaru's role

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.700
as an administrator during the last Chunin exam

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.700
caught the attention of one of the lord's assistants.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.500
That means...

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.400
Yes. The guard's division is like the Guardian Shinobi Twelve.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.970
This means a lot.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.870
Amazing...

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.970
Then did Shikamaru...? Accept the offer?

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.570
That boy...

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.500
I heard you rejected the Feudal Lord's offer.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.530
Yeah...

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.630
It's not a bad idea to experience the world outside.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.570
I don't think I'd be here now...

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.430
if I had not been part of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.870
It doesn't matter.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.000
I hate tedious stuff and that won't change in the future.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.370
It's just that...

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.900
How should I put it...

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.730
It's because I'm concerned about Choji and Ino...

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.800
and the other guys in the unit. And well, Naruto...

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.770
So I'm just hanging around.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.770
I see... You also have the Will of Fire.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.830
The Will of Fire... The thing the Third used to talk about?

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:51.870
That's right. It refers to the strong will of wanting to protect this village.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.830
It's nothing that noble.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.430
Don't be shy.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.470
You're concerned about them, so you want to protect them, right?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.270
We're all Ninja of the Leaf.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.600
It's bound to happen, even though it's not really my thing.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.430
The Will of Fire shines upon the village.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.400
Well, that's what my dad told me.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:33.170
Then, I'll shine light on you someday. Just kidding.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.100
No need to worry about Shikamaru.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.970
Besides, this is the battle to avenge Asuma Sensei.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.600
Shikamaru should be fighting the enemy with a perfect plan.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.170
I can move...!

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.130
I can move...!

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.100
Damn it...

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.970
If you had believed in Lord Jashin,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.270
you may have gotten a helping hand in your time of need.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.570
If you'll believe in Lord Jashin from now on...

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.870
to honor your reformation...

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.230
As if I'd forgive you! Idiot!

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.770
I don't care about his forgiveness.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.900
Shadow Pull Jutsu!

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.870
Y-You...!

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.230
I still have this much...Chakra left.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.570
You...

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.800
Wh-What are you doing?!

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.100
Just watch...

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.330
What?!

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.230
What happened?! When did you do this...?!

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.370
I had this trap prepared beforehand.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:23.930
So he didn't just separate us on a whim, but he purposely lured me here?

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.270
Then...this was all his plan!

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.130
When you curse someone, you dig two holes.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.670
You know what that means?

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.900
What?!

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:41.230
If you curse to kill someone, you also get killed in retribution,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.670
that's why you need two holes for the burial.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.970
You cursed and killed my teacher.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.970
Don't think I'll let you get away free and easy.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.270
This hole is your grave.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.100
I am not gonna die...

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.400
Even if my body is dismembered into pieces and only my head remains,

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:15.270
I am going to drag myself out and eat your throat!

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.930
What?

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:24.770
Deer?

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.000
These woods are a special place in the Land of Fire.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:35.030
Our family is the only ones allowed in. No one else comes here.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.930
Our family will always keep an eye on you.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.900
You did a great job, Shikamaru.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.000
Yeah...

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.870
My Will of Fire...is now yours.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.130
You, why...are you turning that on?

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:02.100
It's the Will of Fire... the will to protect our village.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.200
Good bye...Sensei.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.870
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.330
Multiple Shadow Clones...

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.770
I see... You are the Nine-Tailed Jinchuriki.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.000
What's the situation and the enemy's power?

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.930
The enemy is two Akatsuki.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.270
As I said before, Shikamaru is fighting one of them...

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.270
and the other one is in front of us.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.170
This guy has the power to split.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.370
Those two masks on the shoulders split from the torso.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.100
Each mask has a separate heart and moves independently.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:26.170
He originally had five hearts. He lost two and has only three now.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.730
What do you mean?

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.600
I've killed him twice already.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.600
We need to kill him three more times to finish him off.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.170
Plus, he's an intermediate distance fighter

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.470
and can use multiple Change in Chakra Natures.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.930
No wonder you were having a hard time...

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.730
Naruto!

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.530
I heard it!

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:50.800
Naruto!

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.300
It's no use charging in recklessly!

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:09.330
You can only make Shadow Clones? You can't beat me with that.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.130
Based on his attack speed and fighting style,

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.270
I need at least three Shadow Clones to distract him.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:24.200
He gathered each clones' experience and processed it...

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.500
and based on that, he formed a simulation.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.830
His ability to use Shadow Clones has advanced.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.270
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.500
Three Shadow Clones...

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.170
What's...that?

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:08.670
What a...high pitched...Chakra!

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.200
What...are they...?

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.870
I tried my best... to build it up to here.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:36.600
All right... To test its ability, let's collide it with my Rasengan. Get ready.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.900
What?! If we do that, what's gonna happen?

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.270
If the Jutsu is near completion, my Rasengan will have no effect.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.770
Now let's do it...!

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.800
The Fourth...?!

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.870
What...is that Jutsu...?!

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:53.130
If I get hit by that...then I'm... definitely doomed.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.230
Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.970
I know teamwork is important.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.400
I also know the path ahead is a dangerous one.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:49.030
But right now, I want to take that dangerous path alone!

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:54.900
If I can't reach the other end, I will always remain a kid.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.930
So don't take that path away from me.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.000
Next time: "Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken"

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.770
It's cold!

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:14.470
I'm bored. When does Team Eight's stand-by order end?

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:21.400
It can't be helped, because Kurenai Sensei is in mourning.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.670
I know! I know but...

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.970
Team Ten left on a mission to avenge Asuma Sensei.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.300
And Naruto seems like he is training to complete his new Jutsu.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:34.500
What?!

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.230
Naruto is working hard.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.270
You're blushing.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.130
Huh?

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.900
Ahhh, it's nothing... It's nothing...

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.870
I see, then that's fine... Let's go by Kurenai Sensei's place!

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.170
Let's go, Akamaru.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.870
K-Kiba, wait! Kiba!

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.270
I'm alone again, huh?

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.130
I have it all to myself...

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.700
Ah, this sky is too big.
