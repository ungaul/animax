WEBVTT

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.570
It's so funny…

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.400
What is?

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.190
Right now, you two look like

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.440
you're quite friendly with each other.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.070
What happened to those brothers who fought and hated each other?

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.480
No matter how much you use those eyes of yours…

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.610
I'll use my hatred…

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.400
to turn fantasy into reality!

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.940
It's not hard to guess that something happened between you two,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.110
back when you took him down…

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.150
But what is it that you want to ask of a once-dead man?

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.980
The truth.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.320
Oh really?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.400
Could it be? With the way you're talking…

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.610
you don't really trust Itachi, after all?

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.480
Sasuke…

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.070
Maybe you already know the truth about Itachi?

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.280
No wonder you didn't return to the Leaf

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.400
after defeating Itachi.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.110
That's why you joined the Akatsuki who plotted the Leaf's destruction!

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.530
I see now…

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.530
It all makes so much sense to me now.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.440
That's why you intend to destroy the village

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.690
that caused your brother so much pain.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.940
As expected. You're not denying it.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.150
So you followed your brother, who you happened across,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.570
all the way here to find out the truth once and for all.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.030
Like "Is this what happened then?" and "What about that time?"

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.320
in complete detail…

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.730
Like I said, your brother is a liar!

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.480
I know.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.440
So isn't it odd?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.690
Itachi was willing to kill his own family

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.530
to protect the village.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.150
Isn't that the opposite of what you're trying to do?

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.980
Well… I'm the one who wants what you want, Sasuke!

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.280
After all, Lord Orochimaru could not complete Leaf Destruction.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.940
And it is I who inherited that task.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.610
So think carefully…

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.940
Now's the time to stab Itachi in the back and join me.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.480
What? You don't have to feel guilty.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.190
He's already dead. He's just an imitation.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.530
It was a mission.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.690
To be the sole perpetrator of his clan's slaughter and

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.650
become a Rogue Ninja with his reputation in tatters.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.730
All of that was his mission.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.070
And Itachi completely fulfilled his duty…

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.360
With one exception…

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.400
He could not bring himself… to kill his younger brother.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.610
To Each Their Own Leaf

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.530
We received intel that Itachi Uchiha of the Akatsuki is dead.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.570
Put a mark on his image and remove him from your Bingo Book.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.110
So that traitor is dead at last.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.030
But Captain, who was able to kill him?

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.190
Looks like it was his kid brother, Sasuke.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.940
How ironic…

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.780
His own brother killed the one who slaughtered his family.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.440
Serves him right! After the atrocious thing he did!

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.110
Not only that, he joined up with the Akatsuki

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.480
and came after the Leaf Village!

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.570
He's the most notorious villain in Hidden Leaf history!

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.110
Damn it, I wish we got our hands on him first!

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.150
Since he took down such a special S-Class criminal,

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.570
his little brother will probably receive many decorations

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.610
and a large bounty from the nation and village, right?

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.650
I wonder how much?

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.570
It's not a question of money. You're out of line.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.440
Well… I know, but…

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.400
They don't know the truth…

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.860
Besides, there are too many people around.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.400
I'll teach them the truth!

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.530
Don't…

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.860
Even if they try to confirm the truth about Itachi with their superiors,

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.730
the Leaf's elders will deny it vehemently.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.650
Even the current Hokage doesn't know the facts.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.900
Furthermore…

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.400
Itachi did slaughter the Uchiha, and he joined the Akatsuki

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.400
on the pretense of attacking the Hidden Leaf.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.780
No one will believe the truth…

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.320
Look how long it took you.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.400
For bastards like them…

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.780
For these bastards who easily brand him a traitor…

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.980
my brother… This is exactly what Itachi wanted.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.440
If you don't like it, what is it that you want?

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.360
We're not the same.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.440
My Leaf Destruction is mine alone!

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.190
I understand very well why Itachi chose that life.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.610
I was just like him…

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.230
It was nice being found by a Leaf Shinobi,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.440
but because my background was a mystery,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.360
I was raised to be a spy.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.860
In order to become someone who could be trusted,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.730
Medical Ninjutsu was drilled into me.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.610
I went from village to village spying…

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.730
I pretended to be someone else, living a life of lies.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.480
With no place for the real me.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.400
I had no friends who knew the real me.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.570
I continued to work on suppressing myself.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.570
And around the time I stopped knowing who I even was anymore…

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.440
the Hidden Leaf Village stopped trusting me

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.280
and I was relieved of my mission.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.820
Both Itachi and I worked for the good of the Leaf Village,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.440
but in return, all we got was dishonor and disgrace!

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.110
What in the world has the Leaf Village ever done for us?

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.980
How Itachi lived is what led to the creation of the current you.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.980
And though I am still alive,

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.440
something similar to you was born from me too.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.900
No one understands you better than I.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.530
Thus, I will be your big brother and stick by your side.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.110
Now…join me…

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.610
Don't listen to him, Sasuke.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.690
He was an even better spy than I was.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.900
Which means, he's even better than me at lying.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.650
And…

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.480
No matter what darkness or contradictions lie within the village,

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.150
I am still Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf!

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.440
Sasuke… It's my fault you're like this right now.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.940
I know I have no right to advise you in any way.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.530
But I hope you'll hear me out

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.070
because I have to tell you something.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.780
But first, let's take care of business…

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.440
and stop this guy.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.070
You cannot kill me

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.530
as long as I am the user of the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.780
And I can instantly recover from any injury you inflict.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.400
It's meaningless.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.570
I shut down my eyesight.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.900
So the much-touted genjutsu of your Visual Prowess

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.440
won't work on me…

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.690
You brothers can't beat me!

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.480
Because I cast it,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.190
this Reanimation Jutsu is invincible!

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.230
It's a pain listening to him.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.900
But he explained the situation perfectly.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.980
I don't need you to tell me that.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.530
So…what should we do?

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.070
He doesn't know the true power of the Uchiha.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.150
The Uchiha have a Visual Jutsu that can be used

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.610
on an opponent without eyesight…

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.820
In exchange for losing the light in one's eyes.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.360
Izanagi…?

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.400
You know about Izanagi?

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.230
Danzo used it when I fought him.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.820
You're lucky to be alive.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.030
Never mind about that… How do we use Izanagi?

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.030
I'm not talking about Izanagi.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.860
Another Forbidden Jutsu that is considered its other half.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.570
Another?!

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.860
I've already laid the plan.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.070
An Ultimate Visual Jutsu that holds his fate within its grasp.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.360
Izanami!

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.150
Izanami?!

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.480
If Izanagi is a jutsu that changes one's fate,

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.530
then Izanami is a jutsu that decides it!

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.360
Sasuke… Do not leave my side.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.940
A jutsu that decides one's fate?

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.530
So there's another jutsu similar to Izanagi?!

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.610
I don't know what you're up to…

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.940
but nothing will work against me.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:26.030
It seems you still don't understand just who I am!

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.570
Sage Art… Inorganic Animation!

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.280
Itachi!

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.480
This jutsu brings the lifeless to life

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.610
and allows me to control them.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.150
It's different from a jutsu that simply manipulates with chakra…

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.070
A bit extreme, don't you think?

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.860
Protecting Sasuke with your Susano'o slowed you down.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.780
Well, don't worry. I would never harm Sasuke.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.440
He's my precious test subject.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:06.400
Now then… Time to rewrite your mind with this.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.530
You know what will happen, right?

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.570
Amaterasu!

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.230
So… The Ultimate Visual Jutsu offensive attack

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.730
is also the Ultimate Defense…

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.230
It's so hot, the limestone cave went back to being just a cave.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.190
I'm sorry…Sasuke…

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.400
Sorry, but this is my win.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.480
I am so near the point

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.150
where I can achieve and control everything…

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.440
I can't imagine myself failing.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.610
All the laws and principles of nature,

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.530
which Lord Orochimaru researched and compiled for so long…

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.110
are now stored and being used inside of me.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.530
I have evolved from human to snake to dragon.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.650
I am the closest thing in this world

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.860
to the Sage of Six Paths.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.530
Compared to me, the Uchiha are… Shut up!

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.440
What would you know… about the Uchiha?!

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.570
Listen…!

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:27.860
Kabuto…

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.780
When I look at you,

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.230
it's like looking at my former self.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.440
And that is why you will lose…

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.690
Listen… I'm not on the sidelines anymore.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.070
You could say I'm a central figure in this war!

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.530
I had the Akatsuki twisted around my little finger,

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.400
and manipulated this war to my advantage…

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.650
and I even pushed the Uchiha brothers into a corner.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.530
I hate you, but I understand you.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.940
We were both spies

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.480
who lived false lives in this world.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.980
I didn't know who I really was at one point either.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.900
I finally understand that to know oneself

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.320
is not to achieve everything and become perfect.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.480
It's knowing what you can and cannot do.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.280
Sounds like the words of a loser.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.400
Acknowledging what you cannot do…

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.940
Isn't that the same as giving up?

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.070
No.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.110
It is to be able to forgive oneself

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.980
for the things one cannot do by themselves.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.570
You can't do everything yourself.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.230
That's why you have comrades who can help you.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.480
And it also makes sure that

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.480
you don't miss the things that you can still accomplish.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.900
If you want to know who you are…

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.610
You must reexamine and acknowledge your true self.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.530
I failed to do that.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.980
I lied to everyone and I lied to myself… and I deluded myself.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.480
Those who cannot acknowledge themselves will fail…

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.440
Just like I did.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.530
And what would you two really know about me?

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.440
I have been pursuing who and what I am in my own way.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.480
My whole life…

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.820
I bet he's from that city…

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.190
Where that recent battle was!

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:30.780
What'll we do, Sis?

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.400
He's bleeding from the head.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.030
He's gonna die soon.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.400
Are you gonna take him?

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.610
Urushi… His injuries are less severe than yours were.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.110
Don't worry.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.530
I may not look it, but I know some Medical Ninjutsu.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.230
Where are your parents?

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.650
What's your name?

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.110
Man… Don't you understand anything?!

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.940
Urushi, lend him your shoulder.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.440
You're lucky, kid!

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.570
Come on, grab my shoulder!

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.400
That's my first memory…

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.980
I was a nobody

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.820
and had nothing from the very beginning.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.440
I didn't know my parents… I didn't even know my name.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.150
Your wound seems to be healing nicely.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.400
Hey, at least say, "thank you"!

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.190
Don't you have any manners?!

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.730
Hey, we don't want anything to happen to you again,

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.110
so put this on!

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.900
Ow…

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.940
You don't have manners, you don't have parents…

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.940
you don't even know your name. That's a first for me!

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.940
You'll be living here with us now.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.400
In other words, I am your mother, starting now.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.400
You can always ask me for whatever you need.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.570
It's inconvenient that he doesn't have a name…

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.320
You're right…

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.980
What would be a good name?

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.780
How about… "Kabuto" like the helmet?

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.980
– Sounds simple. – That was quick.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.360
You called it by just how he looks.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.860
It's best not to overthink things.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.400
– I'll think of something. – Not you!

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.440
What would be a good name?

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.610
Hey, he smiled!

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.230
I think he likes that name!

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.230
Oh good…

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.860
At least say, "thank you"! Don't you have any manners?!

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.440
Hmm… What to do…?

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.110
We can't get by with just subsistence aid

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.070
from the village or nation anymore.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.730
We have to talk to them once more!

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.900
Neither the village nor the nation will give us a cent more.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:24.440
But we're barely scraping by.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.440
And we just took another one in…

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.400
I understand. I'll do something about it, so…

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:36.820
Oww!

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.690
What are you doing at this hour?!

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.440
You should be in bed!

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.230
He just got here and

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.530
doesn't know about our curfews and rules!

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.530
Please give him another chance!

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.860
You're too indulgent, Mother.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.530
Come here and look at the clock!

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.530
It's already 20 minutes past lights-out time!

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.110
Which makes lights-out what time?

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.730
Let's learn it right now!

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.440
Well, what time is it? You must learn it yourself!

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.780
He's still young.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.150
He doesn't know arithmetic or how to tell time.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.980
Let's just call it a night.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:37.570
Nine o'clock.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.400
That's correct.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.320
It seems it was just bad vision!

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.860
He's smart for his age!

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.730
We must get him glasses!

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.940
Huh? And where are we going to get money for that?

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.570
Goodness! If you can't see, you should just speak up.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.610
From now, you'll be able to be on time.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.400
I just hope the lenses are right for you.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.690
Thank…you…

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.610
My name is symbolic.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.730
My eyeglasses, a tool…

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.820
Thank you… From the very beginning,

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.110
– I was a nobody… – Thank you…

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.320
Thank you…

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.570
Thank you…

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.570
That's enough.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.110
From the very beginning…

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.110
I had…

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.480
nothing.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.260
Mother…didn't know me. Why?

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.800
Why didn't she know me?

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.840
If she doesn't know me, then who am I?

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.550
What were all those things I received from Mother?

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.970
My name, that I was one of Mother's children,

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.590
even these glasses…

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.800
Who am I?

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.430
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Kabuto Yakushi"

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.090
It seems you no longer see yourself clearly…

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:09.220
KABUTO YAKUSHI Tune in again!
