Tales of a Gutsy Ninja - Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls -Part 2

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.270
I predict the Hidden Leaf shall emerge victorious from this battle.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.070
Therefore, I shall let you three live.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.130
We don't want your sympathy! We can still fight!

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.400
Jiraiya, stop!

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.970
You three are strong...

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.770
You survived even this battleground.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.800
I, Hanzo, hereby name you the "Hidden Leaf's Sannin."

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.800
In exchange for your lives, tell me your names.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.870
Will it really end with the Hidden Leaf's victory like he said?

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.130
And if it does, then what? Will you set out on another journey?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.470
Maybe...

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.030
Set out on my travels and write another book...

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.600
Why won't you settle down in the village?

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.370
I feel as though I haven't encountered it yet.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.230
You mean, your destiny?

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.030
Quiet!

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.070
They're just kids.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.630
Don't let your guard down.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.930
Even little mice can be from the Hidden Rain Village.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.570
Don't hide. Show yourself!

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.830
What do you want?

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.970
Give me some food!

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.770
What about your parents?

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.870
They were killed by ninja because of this war.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.700
Here...have some bread.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.030
Nagato, Konan, come on out! They don't seem like bad guys.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.430
Hey!

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.730
We already gave you food! Why are you following us?!

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.300
Thank you. This is for you...

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.600
It's origami... folded from the bread wrapping.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.770
This is for us?

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.870
Teach us ninjutsu...

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.230
You're all ninja from the Hidden Leaf, right?

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.970
Shall I kill these children?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.030
Wha--?!

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.330
I've seen many war orphans. It's pitiful.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.400
They would be better off

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.800
if we just put them out of their misery right now...

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.830
Orochimaru, enough! You go on ahead with Tsunade.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.830
I'll stay here and look after them for a while.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.030
Huh?!

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.830
Just until they can take better care of themselves...

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.630
It is the least I can do.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.830
But...

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.070
This is also part of destiny...

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.600
Thank you for the food!

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.900
Grilled fish in an instant with my Fire Style Jutsu.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.500
Mm... Delicious!

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.730
Sensei! I've gotten the hang of fishing!

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.800
Hmm?

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.670
What's the matter, Nagato?

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.330
I just remembered my family...

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.670
And...

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.270
Stop crying! You're a man!

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.000
It's because of guys like you

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.800
that men of the Hidden Rain are considered cowards!

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.300
Things are unstable among three of the Great Nations

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.470
that surround the Hidden Rain Village.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.500
But this war won't drag out much longer.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.400
By the time you are grown,

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.330
there will be mutual understanding and peace will-

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.670
That's not fair!

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.130
We all lost our families!

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.030
If there is a mutual understanding,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.670
it's only after they go through what we did!

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.370
That's what it means to get even, right?!

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.900
But...I know that's impossible.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.630
That's why wars will never end!

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.530
I hate rain.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.630
This land is always crying.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.270
It's a coward!

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.000
I'm gonna change this land.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.200
I'll protect everyone!

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.970
That's why Jiraiya Sensei...! Please teach us ninjutsu!

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.530
I don't have any ideas for my novel...

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.800
If there is a mutual understanding,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.730
it's only after they go through what we did!

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.570
That's why wars will never end!

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.770
I'll protect everyone!!

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.500
I want the hero to wipe away the hatred and bring about peace...

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.570
Now then...how can I...?

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.000
Jiraiya Sensei, help! Yahiko and Nagato are in trouble...!

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.270
Lead the way, Konan!!

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.130
I brought Sensei!

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.070
What happened?

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.630
This...

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.470
This leftover ninja told us to hand over our food...and valuables.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.170
Then Nagato...

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.700
He's a chunin from the Hidden Stone...

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.200
How did Nagato...?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.600
Th-Those eyes...!!

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.300
He couldn't...possibly be...!

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:30.070
That shape... That ripple pattern... I can't believe it!

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.770
That eye...

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.570
Said to hold the most noble of the three great Visual Jutsu...

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.300
The Rinnegan!

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.470
The Sage of the Six Paths, said to be the father of all ninja...

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.670
It is said that the Sage possessing the Rinnegan eye

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.800
developed all the jutsu known to us today.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.170
Rumored to always appear when the world becomes corrupt,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.470
capable of being both a godlike force of creation

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.570
and an all-obliterating instrument of destruction.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.770
I always believed it as a mere legend.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.030
But here is someone who actually possesses the Rinnegan!

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.730
I shall now tell you... In my dream...

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.970
You, who are solely pervy, will still manage to become a splendid ninja.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:17.530
And in time, you will have your own disciple...

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.030
That disciple will become a ninja who will bring about a great change

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.170
to the ninja world.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.400
That is what I saw in my dream.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.230
You will guide that revolutionary...

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.600
The day will come when you will be forced to make a critical selection.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.200
Could Nagato be this revolutionary?

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.170
Perhaps I have found my destiny.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.670
I've decided to teach you ninjutsu.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.330
R-Really?!

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.530
You may encounter another life-threatening situation like that last time.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.430
It is ninjutsu for self-defense.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.430
Yes!

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.530
Thanks for saving us last time, Nagato! Sorry I called you a coward!

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.330
Next time anything happens, I'll protect you!

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.870
Th-Thanks, Yahiko.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.300
Huh...? But Nagato is stronger than you, Yahiko!

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.470
I'm gonna train starting now and I'll become stronger!

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.400
You always exaggerate, Konan!

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.930
All right, let's start!

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.670
The first lesson is on molding chakra.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.470
- Yes, Sensei! - Yes, Sensei!

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.530
Something's bothering you, eh?

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.000
Talk to me.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.570
Sensei...

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.370
Is it about that incident?

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.000
That day...

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.100
When that man hurt Yahiko, I was so mad at him.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.530
Everything went blank in my head... I didn't know what I was doing.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.700
Before I realized it, the man was dead...

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.000
After that, I got so scared.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.830
This hatred made me lose myself... and I killed someone.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.530
What I did was wrong! There had to be a better way--!

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.830
Nagato...

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.730
I really don't know if it was right or wrong.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.530
But thanks to you, Yahiko didn't die.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.400
You protected your friend.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.330
That had to be the right thing to do.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.500
No one can blame you for that.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.170
When you are hurt, you learn to hate.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.900
On the other hand, when you hurt someone, you are resented.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.900
But you start to feel guilty as well.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:08.400
Understanding such pain enables you to be kind to others...

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.430
That's what makes us human.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.130
What do you mean by that...?

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.700
It's called growing up.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.100
Growing up? What do you mean?

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.330
That, you need to figure out yourself.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.830
Konan and I were crying because we were so hungry

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.230
and Yahiko saved us.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.470
He stole food from others to feed us.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.430
I just want to protect those two.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.500
No matter what kind of pain I have to endure.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.470
I see.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:05.400
"TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA" BY JIRAIYA

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.530
Water Style: Raging Waves!

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.800
Paper Shuriken!

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.630
Wind Style: Gale Palm!

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.000
We did it!

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.500
How's that, Sensei?!

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.230
You're even able to take down my Shadow Clone now, eh?

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.970
Now I can return to my village without any worries.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.200
- Huh? - Huh?

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.400
You are on your own from now on.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.330
You've done well these past three years!

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.530
Don't cry, Yahiko. Or people will call you a coward.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.170
Konan... You're gonna grow up to be a beauty.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.800
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.570
This is a poor land.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.370
And there's more sadness and tough times up ahead.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.700
But now, you have the strength to change this land.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.000
Nagato... You three have grown up.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.400
Don't you agree?

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.530
Thank you, Sensei.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:46.570
Even after Jiraiya returned to the village, the Third Great Ninja War raged on.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.600
Tsunade! Orochimaru! Ready?!

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:50.330
Yeah!

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.900
- Summoning Jutsu! - Summoning Jutsu!

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.830
The Hidden Leaf's Sannin distinguished themselves in many battles...

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.170
leaving legends in their wake.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.530
All this fighting... How long must it continue?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.530
What must be done to stop the war?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.670
Humph... As if there's a way to stop it.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.670
Hate only gives birth to even more hate.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.930
But...!

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:33.330
I don't know how to stop it. But peace will certainly come.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.730
As long as there are those who believe that, there is hope.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.530
Oh, what's the matter?

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.070
What's wrong?

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.170
Those three have died.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.330
I've tried my best to make the right choices.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.530
I believed that was what destiny had in store for me.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.270
Jiraiya...

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.500
And finally... I thought I did what was right.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.970
But perhaps, I was wrong yet again.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.230
You'll find it as long as you keep believing.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:43.030
Yes... I guess I'm still in the middle of my journey.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.230
The Third Great Ninja War dragged on

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.130
and the one who guided Hidden Leaf Village to victory

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:58.530
was another one of Jiraiya's disciples... Minato Namikaze.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.270
That was long. Too long...

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.700
What will you do from now on?

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:14.970
Let's see... Maybe set out on another journey.

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:19.870
Maybe I'll find a disciple who can change the world.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.200
Is that your destiny? The destiny of Jiraiya?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.070
Well, I guess you could say that...

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.500
Humph... What a strange man you are.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.200
Hmm? You walk the path of the ninja.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.930
Don't you want someone to take over after you?

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.030
To gather all the jutsu in this world and master them...

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.230
That is my only goal.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.500
Even if you master them all, humans are not immortal.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:50.900
She's right.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.170
I wonder about that...

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.930
TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.330
Give it up.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.200
Can I say one thing?

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.530
I don't care to listen!!

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.000
Die already!

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.900
Give up...

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.070
...on me giving up!

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.600
Even if you bring me down,

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.500
another assassin will attack the village...

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.500
As long as we are cursed to live in this ninja world,

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.670
there will be no peace.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.400
Then...I'll break that curse!

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.000
If there is such a thing as peace, I'll seize it!

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.300
I'll never give up!

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.000
Wh-Who are you...?

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.800
My name is...

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.300
Oh...you were reading my "Tales of a Gutsy Ninja"?

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.770
But it's my first published work.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.400
The sentences are childish and I didn't do a good job.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.670
No, I don't think so. This tale is wonderful!

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.830
Oh...?

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.370
Each chapter reads like one of your numerous legendary exploits.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.400
It's almost like an autobiography.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.500
But...it didn't sell at all.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.370
For my next one, I think I'll add some sexy elements to spice it up a bit.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.730
The main character of this book...

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.070
I thought his determination to never give up was really cool.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.030
He's a lot like you, Sensei.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.230
Y-You think so...?

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.570
So I was thinking.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.470
Huh?

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.870
I really hope my unborn child can become a ninja

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.900
just like this main character!

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:10.130
Which is why I'd like your permission to name my son after him.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.470
H-Hey! Are you sure?

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.600
It's just a random name that I thought up while eating ramen.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.900
Naruto...

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.100
It's a wonderful name.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.400
Kushina...

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.570
Cripes... So that makes me his godfather?

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.970
Are you really sure about this?

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.830
You are my sensei!

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.200
And you are a great ninja who possesses the true talent of a ninja!

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.330
There's no other like you.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.270
Even after this...

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.730
Jiraiya continued his journey in search of his destiny.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:58.930
It would be a little later before Jiraiya would meet Naruto

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.970
in the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.420
What's going on here?!

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.850
It's great that I got in so easily,

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.980
but who is this Pain that everybody speaks of?!

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.820
All I get from the villagers are vague descriptions such as "god" or "angel."

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.850
And I don't know the whereabouts of the former village leader,

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.280
Hanzo of the Salamander.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.080
But there's no time to waste...

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.980
Guess I'll go with that plan!

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:05.620
Next time: "Infiltrate! The Village Hidden in the Rain"

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.650
Tune in again!
