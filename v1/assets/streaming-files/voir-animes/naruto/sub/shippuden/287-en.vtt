Sasuke's Story: The Last One

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.030
You were gonna use that to get revenge against the Uchiha

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.280
who forced the Chinoike Clan to Hell Valley?

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.030
So I was your target from the very start.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.450
If I sent Exploding Humans to Hidden Leaf Village,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.320
you were sure to return.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.570
I planned to kill you and the entire Leaf Village, but…

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.660
You happened to meet me at Bamboo Village, is that it?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.740
Coincidence is a scary thing, don't you think?

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.990
We attacked that village just to get back at them for the last time…

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.370
Meeting you there was the last thing we expected.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.870
But thanks to

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.490
the head of the Bamboo Village's interesting parting words,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.910
we changed our plans.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.660
I'll never forgive you… Fuushin!

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.280
I happened to be looking for Fuushin, so you joined up with me and

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.370
used your Exploding Humans whenever something happened as a diversion.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.120
And Nowaki, rather Fuushin, would come after me with his chakra sword.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.280
And just in case you couldn't kill me,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.620
you went so far as to ask an old partner

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.990
to stand by and pretend to be Fuushin.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.570
So what now? Are you gonna kill me?

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.950
You and me… We're the last ones from the Chinoike and Uchiha Clans.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.370
Let's put it all on the line

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.820
and fight to the death!

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.660
Unfortunately, I'm not interested in that.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.990
You're the same as usual…

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.200
But don't think you can go around

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.570
with that aloof expression on your face forever.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.570
The Chinoike Clan uses blood to handle all kinds of jutsu.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.820
And here in this location…

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.410
this red lake with its high iron content…

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.870
will make the power of the Chinoike even stronger!

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.410
What?!

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.570
Take this!

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.370
Go!

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.910
Do you still want to continue?

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.200
Chakra is entering from my wound?!

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.030
What?!

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.450
My chakra seals the wound and waits.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.660
Waits for what?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.910
Isn't it obvious?

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.700
Good bye, Sasuke Uchiha.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.490
So that's how you made the Exploding Humans?

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.660
The Sharingan?!

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.410
I envied you, Sasuke.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.200
You were born in the Hidden Leaf Village

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.990
and bore the Uchiha name…

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.990
and you had a family that loved you.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.280
When you deserted your village, you and your reputation were notorious.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.700
But even now, you're allowed to travel freely.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.820
That's because you have people who love and protect you.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.490
I know…

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.740
You've always, always had someone who kept loving you, no matter what.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.370
You're not like me… I've been alone from the beginning!

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.120
You've been alone from the beginning!

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.530
How the hell do you think you understand?

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.740
It's because I have these ties, that I feel this agony.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.240
How could you possibly understand

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.820
what it feels like to lose all that?!

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.160
So…

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.200
So why do you fight for the Hidden Leaf?!

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.950
The leaves of the Hidden Leaf are brilliant,

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.490
but its roots are black!

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.990
There is light and darkness in the Hidden Leaf!

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.870
Your clan was used up and

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.660
absorbed by the Leaf's roots as nourishment!

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.530
So why do you go so far for them?!

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.490
Because I'm alive.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.410
What do you mean?

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.570
I have a friend who saved me.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.490
A friend with whom I can share my pain, and him, with me.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.780
His wish is that one day the world will be like us.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.530
A world like that is impossible.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.160
That's just wishful thinking!

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.910
That's why he wants to make it real!

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.530
And it's that hopeful heart that connects me to the Hidden Leaf!

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.570
To be like my older brother…

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.950
and support this world from the shadows, and…

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.870
And?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.780
And look beyond this world… to the light!

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.570
I don't want to see such a world!

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.450
Enough already! Kill me!

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.070
Hurry and kill me!

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.120
Chino!

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.240
Fuushin!

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.070
Fuushin!

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:17.820
Fuushin?!

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.490
What are you doing here?

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.030
Fuushin?

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.700
Now, you should be able to understand the meaning of my words.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.530
I have a friend who saved me.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.120
A friend with whom I can share my pain, and him, with me.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.910
If you're going to kill someone, kill me.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.240
Fuushin, it's okay.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.530
It's okay.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:21.120
I'd be in pain…if you died.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.700
Chino…

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.490
Sasuke dear, I wish I didn't meet you at Bamboo Village.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.240
Then I could have kept on hating you.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:49.660
Also, I want to see this world that you speak of…

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.840
This is the last one…

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.510
It's penetrated the brachial artery.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.710
We're good now.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.340
There's no more unusual chakra flowing inside of him now.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800
Thank you.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.460
What would I have done without you?

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.090
I think it's all because of your exceptional skill, Sakura!

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.760
The ringleader was turned over to the authorities last night, right?

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.880
Yes.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.010
Was Sasuke there?

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.380
I thought he would be.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.210
But they asked the Leaf shinobi go over to the Land of Steam to take custody.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.590
The one who captured the ringleader didn't return…

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.800
Hello.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.050
I'm the perpetrator.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.010
I take all responsibility.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.800
So please go easy on the other two.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.420
Chino, that's not what we want.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.510
That's right, Miss Chino!

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.380
I–!

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.590
Now calm down…

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.460
Actually, the Mizukage of the Land of Mist

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.010
wants to take custody of you.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.460
W-Why?

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.800
Now's the only time to stop the chain of negativity.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.920
Please come in.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.170
Let's skip the greetings.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.590
I'd once heard about your past connection to the Hidden Mist.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.460
Huh?

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.590
If it's okay with you…

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.130
I'd like you to help the Hidden Mist.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.710
W-Why?

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.800
You must atone for what you did for the rest of your lives.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:12.210
But every shinobi, great and small, must bear the same burden.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.880
I'm no different.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.550
Would you like to fight again… with your own life?

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.710
And, there's another thing I need to let you know.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.420
Around now, he's…

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.550
W-What is this…!

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.670
The last Uchiha...

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.130
a.k.a. Sasuke Uchiha has returned to the Coliseum!

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.050
To a victim,

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.630
the assailant and a third party are no different.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.050
People are no better than the assailant

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.880
if they didn't try to help.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.260
If you only pity the loser and do nothing

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.420
to stop the decadence of the rich…

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.510
you're just as guilty, Sasuke.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.590
I will welcome all challenges!

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.920
And I will free all shinobi!

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.090
If you desire the Uchiha's eye, come and get it!

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.590
Sasuke is—?!

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.050
But there are many shinobi with Kekkei Genkai there!

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.010
Even someone like Sasuke…

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.130
Don't underestimate Sasuke, ya know!

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.840
Sasuke's probably doing this for your sake.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.550
So he will never, ever lose!

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.550
So you're Sasuke's?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.260
Yeah, I'm his friend.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.090
I'm Naruto Uzumaki.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.300
Your friend saved me.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.800
I'm very grateful.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.550
I see!

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.210
Th-This is something no one's ever imagined!

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.510
Sasuke Uchiha has beaten each and every shinobi!

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.590
Which means, he has acquired every, single shinobi!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.590
What's gonna happen to us?

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.380
The Hidden Cloud will take you in.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.670
The Hidden Cloud?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.590
Indeed!

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.420
We, the Hidden Cloud, will safeguard all shinobi!

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:45.050
At the same time, everyone who took part in the illegal gambling here

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.710
will be taken into custody.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.340
This is so dull.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.420
This isn't looking good.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.510
I'm here, kid.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.510
I'm grateful.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.510
Be grateful to your Lord Sixth.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.050
– He came and insisted... – Hurry and come here!

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.460
that this island was close to my village,

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.920
and that it was the Cloud's business to deal with it.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.300
That's why we're here… So dull…

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.460
Long ago,

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.510
Naruto put his hands together and passionately argued for you.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.800
OFFICIAL MISSIVE TO THE LORD HOKAGE FROM THE RAIKAGE It was the time you kidnapped my kid brother, Bee,

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.420
and Danzo agreed to our request

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.960
to mark you a Rogue Ninja and assassinate you.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:49.510
I want you to cancel the disposal of Sasuke Uchiha!

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.760
I'm begging you!

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.130
I don't want us killing each other for revenge anymore!

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.510
I'm glad we didn't kill you back then.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:12.050
Know yourself and know others, and never alter your path again.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.590
Feel the significance of why you can walk this world freely.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.840
And create a reason to convince others around you.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.130
Perhaps with this incident, you just created one.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.210
But just one won't be enough.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.590
You weren't caught?

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.800
I'm here, aren't I?

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.380
Did things work out as planned?

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.090
Thanks to you, it did.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.760
Conflict breaks out easily in small communities.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.800
Even though they've lived shoulder to shoulder for many years,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.420
even the smallest incident festers hatred

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.420
and in the end, they end up killing each other off.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.960
That sounds like the Uchiha Clan.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.420
They were definitely like that, however…

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.590
This is the truth of the Chinoike Clan.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.880
When my wife got wrapped up in everything and died…

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.340
lots of things didn't matter anymore.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.460
That's why you killed your entire clan?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.210
Even still, my daughter is quite endearing.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.420
And you saw with your own eyes the foolish thing

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.460
that your dear daughter of yours was doing in the Coliseum.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.670
I wonder if that's why you gave up on acquiring Sasuke,

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.590
and used him instead to stop your daughter?

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.920
You're such a doting parent…

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.670
I consider myself more of a foolish parent…

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.880
Still it feels strange.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.630
Sasuke's not back in the village, yet he's protecting it.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.510
You're right.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.380
There are so many things we can't do

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.510
without a skilled shinobi like Sasuke.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:13.420
There are guys who do terrible things like this time,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.090
but I guess everything works out

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.510
as long as there are guys like Sasuke to counter it.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.920
You seem kinda happy, Sakura.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:23.760
Huh?

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.420
Sasuke said to me before he left on his journey…

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.550
This is a trip to atone for my sins.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.380
With this recent incident,

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.920
I know that Sasuke is definitely making inroads.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.460
Just…

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:48.420
I just wish I was there next to him…

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.630
F-Forget what I just said!

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:53.550
Huh?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.460
It's probably from Kakashi.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.840
So messy. It's Naruto's writing…

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.880
Sasuke…

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.550
You're not back in the village, but you're still protecting it.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.010
You're just like the Leaf Police Force!

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.550
HIDDEN LEAF POLICE FORCE Are you going to join too?

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.380
HIDDEN LEAF POLICE FORCE Well… I wonder about that...

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.590
Why not?

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.880
When I grow up, I'm going to join the Leaf Police Force too!

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.090
It's been a while… Maybe I'll go home.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.980
Regarding the issue with the Land of Silence,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.820
it's going to become violent, eventually…

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.230
If they find out we've independently started investigating,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.940
it's going to get troublesome.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.070
That being said, it would be bad if we call on the alliance

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.190
and take aggressive action on Land of Silence, right?

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.570
Well, we just achieved peace…

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.730
Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:04.150
"Shikamaru's Story: A Cloud Drifting in the Silent Dark, Part 1: The State of Affairs"

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.480
We can't just stand by without taking action any further.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:18.390
Tune in again!
