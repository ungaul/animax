00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.920
Itachi's Story - Light and Darkness: The Darkness of the Akatsuki

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.080
Do you know a shinobi named Might Dai?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.630
I know a Might Guy.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.210
Huh, well that’s the kid from that time.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.250
I was one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.380
Thanks to Might Dai, the seven of us got cut down to three.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.380
Who could have expected that scuzzy bearded jerk

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.210
would use taijutsu like that?

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.130
Anyway, I wanna make something clear...

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.670
I could care less why you joined the Akatsuki.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.000
I don’t even want to hear your reason.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.170
It doesn’t matter why I joined either.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.420
And it’s okay if you don’t want to know.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.080
Listen to me!

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.000
There’s something I need to ask you.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.080
And…

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.630
It’s about your ninjutsu specialties.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.880
As you see, I use this Executioner’s Blade and cut up enemies.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.420
So? How about you?

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.130
Genjutsu, Fire Style and Shuriken Jutsu.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.000
You’re awfully humble!

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.710
Former ANBU Itachi Uchiha, Itachi of the Sharingan, the Clan-Killer Itachi...

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.380
People throw around many nicknames for you...you’re notorious.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.670
Let’s decide on our formations.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.080
You’ll start with a preemptive attack

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.920
with your genjutsu, shuriken or whatever’s your specialty.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.040
Then I’ll jump in.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.540
And you back me up.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.040
That will be Formation B What’s A?

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.750
We each do things our own way.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.500
Understood.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.290
One word of warning.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.080
Don’t take any opponent for granted.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.040
Understood.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.330
- Who are you? - Get out of our way!

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.170
Shinobi villages only say things about peace and order,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.540
but they’re really worried about their roles shrinking.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.170
Behind the scenes, they’re all trying

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.790
to lessen their opponent’s power while increasing their own.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.790
All the while, preventing other nations from finding out their schemes.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.750
That’s why the Akatsuki gets jobs.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.130
The more peaceful the world is, the more work we get...

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.080
We accept every request. We don’t care about the details.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.080
You scoundrels!

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.540
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.460
Why you—!

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.670
That’s why… We don’t know who’s inside this palanquin…

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.710
And we don’t want to know either.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.170
There’s also no need to think about

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.210
who the hell would pay us to do such dirty work.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.130
That’s what the Akatsuki is about.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.830
Pain, the leader, said the Akatsuki was going to rule the world.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.380
That won’t be for a long time.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.960
We first need to amass money and power.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.210
Speak of the devil, he’s summoning us.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.000
So Itachi, have you gotten used to the Akatsuki?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
How would you feel about changing partners and teaming up with me?

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.130
Hey, we’re just getting our formation down.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.040
Don’t try to steal him.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.000
I second changing partners...

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.290
There’s an aspect called compatibility...

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.330
I wish our leader would put a bit more thought into this.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.960
You’re one to talk, you damn snake!

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.460
Thanks to your work, Akatsuki’s reputation is growing in the underworld.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.420
The jobs we’re getting are becoming bigger in scale,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.880
which means higher compensation as well.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.080
But that’s only just a step.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.580
And the Akatsuki is ready to move on to the next step…

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.130
which are the Tailed Beasts.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.210
There’re supposed to be nine of ‘em. Are those the Tailed Beasts?

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.170
The Five Great Ninja Nations harbor most of them.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.380
But the whereabouts are unknown for a few of them.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.880
Those who aren’t on a job will try to locate them.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.080
So we just have to locate them?

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.500
For now.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.540
What will you do with them eventually?

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.130
We’ll hunt down and collect every Tailed Beast.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.500
And then?

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.210
They’ll act as our deterrents in our quest for world domination.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.170
Tailed Beasts?

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.920
Seems to me there are lots of other ways…

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.130
There’s no mistake in the leader’s reasoning.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.040
Here are the assignments.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.670
Juzo…

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.420
You’ll handle the request from the Land of Water.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.000
Isn’t there another mission I can do?!

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.830
You’re familiar with the territory.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.630
This is ridiculous.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.830
I never wanted to go back to that depressing place.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.420
Is that the village where you’re from?

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.670
The job’s easy.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.290
We have to assassinate a member

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.830
from the Feudal Lord's clan in the Land of Water.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.130
I'll explain...

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.080
It’s an intra-clan fight over succession,

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.210
a common occurrence in the Land of Water.

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.210
The Hidden Mist cannot interfere in the Feudal Clan's affairs.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.670
That’s why they’ve come to the Akatsuki.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.790
This river’s the border.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.080
Have you ever been to the Land of Water?

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.750
Never on a mission.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.250
So for an outing then?

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.000
You’ve got no sense of humor!

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.130
But you do know, don’t you?

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.460
What happens to a shinobi from another village

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.580
if he’s discovered in the Land of Water?

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.500
The Hidden Mist doesn’t have a policy for prisoner exchange...

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.670
If captured, the shinobi will be made to divulge his jutsu

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.080
and he’ll be disposed of.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.580
You have it good, Itachi.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.000
The Leaf is naïve.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.210
That’s why you and Orochimaru can go around without a care as Rogue Ninja...

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.960
There is a special unit in the Hidden Mist that track down Rogue Ninja.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.790
If I ever get caught in this village…

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.920
Oh, I forgot all about Formation C.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.080
If I’m caught by the Mist, kill me immediately.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.710
If I have a chance.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.080
So what do you want me to do for Formation D?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.630
Nothing in particular.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.790
Fine, let’s get going!

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.170
Are you good at infiltrating?

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.580
I'm average.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.580
Okay, show me.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.580
P-Please! Spare me!

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.000
I don’t bear a grudge against you.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.960
This is just my job.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.630
W-Wait!

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.580
Hey… Yeah.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.880
Hidden Mist Jutsu…!

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.830
Wind Style! Supreme Typhoon!

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.920
This is—?!

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.960
Lord Fourth!

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.000
Is that the Mizukage?

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.670
Do you remember my warning?

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.830
Any way you look at him, he’s a kid.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.790
He’s the Jinchuriki of the Three Tails.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.250
And they are the Mist’s Shinobi Tracking Unit.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:29.130
I never expected you to reappear in the Village, Juzo.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.130
I didn’t wanna come back either. I had no choice.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.000
I have a ton of things to say to you…

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.750
At the very least, I’m taking back the Executioner’s Blade.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.040
Even if your partner is Itachi of the Sharingan.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:48.790
So I guess a surprise attack with your genjutsu is meaningless.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.170
What do you want to do?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.000
This one’s a Formation C.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.040
Formation C? Understood.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.380
Don’t look!

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.080
It's a Water Clone!

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.710
Itachi!

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.670
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.210
Lord Fourth!

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.130
You two…

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.130
I’ll show no mercy.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.150
Tailed Beast State?!

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.320
The Fourth is a Jinchuriki who can control his Tailed Beast!

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.280
This is not the Hidden Leaf!

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.230
Juzo!

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.530
It’s the Fourth’s Coral Palm Jutsu.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.480
Juzo?!

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.400
Run… Itachi…

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.150
W-What?!

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.360
What is this?

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.610
The power of the Mangekyo Sharingan?

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.110
Why you—!

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.320
Juzo…?

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.320
Did you kill…the Mizukage?

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.650
No, he’s not dead yet.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.190
Then…

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.280
Hurry! Go!

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.570
But…

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.280
It's all over for me…

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.570
You don’t have to be a Medic Ninja to know that, right?

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.860
I’m sorry.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.480
What a stupid thing to say.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.360
Do you have any last words for anyone?

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.570
Like I'd have anyone, idiot.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.110
I see…But you have someone like that, huh?

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.900
Hurry and go!

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.230
I’m just gonna drop dead, right here, where I'm from…

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.570
…this god-forsaken, Blood Mist Village…

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.150
I thought my only partner… was this guy here, but…

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.190
Juzo Biwa is dead.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:56.480
Oh my, and he was your teammate, Itachi.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.110
The Jinchuriki of the Three Tails killed him.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:04.280
Which means you took on the Mizukage and came out of it alive.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.940
Another one of us is dead.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:13.440
Rather than being killed by the enemy, he was killed by friendly fire.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.610
He was just too slow.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.030
Let everyone here be the judge of that.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.150
Fire Style: Searing Migraine!

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.530
Done in bad faith.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.190
Sounds like it was on purpose.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.190
He should have just dodged it.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.190
You ignored your partner, didn't you?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.900
So what?

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.900
You wanted to kill him, didn't you?

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.530
So what?

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.360
Oh, nothing. It just seems to happen a lot.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.980
The Akatsuki works in two-man teams.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.860
What will you do, Kakuzu?

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.150
Will you team up with Itachi who’s also lost his partner?

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.820
As long as he doesn’t irritate me.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.320
I wouldn’t know how to cater to your moods.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.820
What the hell did you say? Then let's team up and I'll show you.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.230
Wait, I’ll team up with Itachi.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.940
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?!

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.150
The Akatsuki needs to find some new members.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.400
We’ll put this issue on hold until we do.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.530
Do you know what eternal life is, Itachi?

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.900
I don’t know yet, either.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.820
That’s why I need a new body.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.610
A magnificent body to link me to eternal life.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.280
First of all, the problem with you… is your greed.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.360
Impossible! Have I fallen prey to the Paralysis Jutsu?

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.780
What incredible Visual Prowess…

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.980
Magnificent!

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.190
Orochimaru…

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.030
Try all of the jutsu you wish...

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.150
But, my eyes can see through all of them.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.150
You're so blunt… I’m not sure what to do with you.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:21.320
Whether to kill you right now, or find a way to use you.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.530
I-Itachi!

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.780
You just don’t have enough...

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.030
No, you lack it completely...the greed…

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.900
for human life!

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.650
Lord Orochimaru!

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.530
I’ll definitely get you back for this.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.690
Orochimaru betrayed and deserted our organization.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.940
I knew it, that bastard.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.860
He always put himself before the organization.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.820
I don’t intend to let Orochimaru get away with this,

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.480
but right now, we’re short members.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.730
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.570
How about letting me join?

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.360
Get lost!

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.150
Okay… Leave Orochimaru to me.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:28.110
His subordinate, Kabuto, is my puppet.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.940
I’ll find out where he’s hiding out in no time.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.980
No need to rush.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.820
I have someone in mind to be your partner.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.190
It can wait until he joins us.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.480
What about me?

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.860
Do I team up with Itachi?

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.690
Work alone for a while longer.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.230
I have someone else I’ve prepared to partner up with Itachi.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.190
I’m going to be your partner from today.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.480
Hey, you over there!

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.020
I’m not gonna fall for your genjutsu ever again, hmm!

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.140
I’m going to give you a little taste of what art is.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.350
Let's leave it at that.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:05.770
Sasori… partner with Deidara and go kill Orochimaru.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.850
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Partner"

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.980
Who the hell is this Orochimaru guy?

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.820
