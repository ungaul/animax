WEBVTT

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.650
Those Who Dance in the Shadows

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.610
What is this chakra?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.630
They all sense the chakra,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.000
even though none of them are sensory types.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.540
This chakra is...

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.710
Let's go.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.080
Hurry and lead the way, Orochimaru.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.410
It looks like he's a bit concerned...

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.190
about Naruto.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.070
That's Nine Tails'— I mean, Naruto's chakra!

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.610
Nice work transforming and transferring my chakra, Naruto!

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.440
I've gotten the hang of it. Work with me, Kurama!

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.480
That shinobi Nara,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.020
he sure analyzed my chakra exchange capabilities extensively.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.640
We've kept them waiting a while.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.230
A few shadow clones should be okay.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.350
Got it!

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.830
A-Amazing... Naruto is able to use this chakra...

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.700
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.740
You're late, Naruto!

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.990
Sorry!

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.410
Choji! Ino!

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.450
O-Okay!

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.040
What...is this?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.180
Are these calories?

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.590
Hey! Choji!

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.970
You're gaining weight again!

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.220
That brat Naruto... Is he giving them the Nine Tails' chakra?

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.720
8 Trigrams Air Palm!

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.640
I feel...my power surging!

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.220
She did that with just an Air Palm?!

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.340
That girl...

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.680
She's gotten quite strong after getting power from Naruto...

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.840
Expansion Jutsu!

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.590
Shikamaru! Ino!

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.390
Are you ready?!

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.140
- Yeah! - Okay!

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.340
You all understand the plan, right? Beat it into your heads!

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.390
Start with Ino-Shika-Cho!

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.180
What if the plan doesn't work?

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.840
Then you live on and take the reins, Shikamaru.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.840
HQ will be wiped out shortly.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.890
The only face time I spent with you as your father

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.220
was when we played shogi.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.300
I haven't given you a thing-- You gave me plenty.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.140
I was able to grow up, staring at your back, Dad.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.220
Ino...

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.800
You've grown up to become the embodiment

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.640
of the Yamanaka clan's purple crest, the bush clover, and what it symbolizes...

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.590
Optimistic love...right?

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.640
That's not the only thing the bush clover stands for.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.800
The thing I am most proud of is your care and compassion...

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.340
for your friends!

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.140
I've watched you blossom into a beautiful bush clover flower...

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.890
Our time's almost up.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.300
Do you have any final words, Shikaku?

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.590
Hmm...

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.550
Could you tell your mom this for me, Shikamaru...

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.260
Wait! Before that, throw out that thing in the wooden box

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.840
on the left-hand shelf of the storeroom

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.300
without your mom finding out!

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.590
I know all about it... Don't worry...

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.890
Lastly, from me...

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.300
Never forget that we live on inside of you forever.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.640
Don't forget!

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.090
Don't mock me!

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:26.800
What?!

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.430
- Shadow Possession... - Mind Transfer...

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.300
- Jutsu! - Jutsu!

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.720
I'm in!

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.470
Tsk... They did it again!

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.260
Damn you!

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.390
They're faster than me!

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.840
Nice, Ino!

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.840
They just keep on coming...

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.930
Now it's the Nara's Paralysis jutsu...

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.430
- Don't mess with the Nara Clan! - Don't mess with the Nara Clan!

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.680
All right! We stopped him in his tracks!

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.680
You can stop now, Ino!

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.300
Are you all right?!

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.680
Y-Yeah...

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.300
Neji!

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.510
Lee, stop crying!

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.340
Lee...

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.260
Lee...

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.180
So long as we don't abandon Neji's convictions,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.340
he will continue to live on, connected inside all of us.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.140
Let me share a little something with you.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.050
It's those connections that made me what I am today!

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.140
You ought to know that bonds can be powerful curses too!

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.640
Naruto...

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.090
I was the one who once told you,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.470
"I will never let my comrades die..."

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.260
Those words are also an admonition aimed at myself.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.430
I haven't been able to save many comrades.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.760
Which is why I keep telling myself this time, I will protect them.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:28.010
But then, I end up having to face the fact that I couldn't once more.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.720
I'll be confronting those wounds... for the rest of my life.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.300
But that's why we're ninja.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.050
We are those who endure.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.140
They'll never let you forget.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.840
But it's those wounds that prove your comrades live on inside here.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.220
Your friends are still alive in here...

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.720
Friends that you create inside a dream,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.010
so you can't get hurt, aren't real.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.680
That means you're just erasing your real friends!

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:09.010
Curse or not, I want to keep the real Neji right here.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.590
The real Neji...right here...

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.640
Gentle Fist!

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.680
It's no use, Lee.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.800
No matter how hard you try, you'll never defeat me.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.470
That's just how things are.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.720
Look for a different rival.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.340
So you saw me lose.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.510
Hey, Lee, I used to think that

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.180
you couldn't change the fate that was handed to you...

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.090
One day, I'll fight you for real, so we can see which is greater,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.840
your Ferocious Fist or my Gentle Fist.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.720
But...I shall not lose so long as my eyes are black.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.090
In your case, Neji, isn't it the white of your eyes?

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.590
Oh... Yeah... But anyway... You have me as your rival.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.510
It's a lot stronger than before, and more of it than last time.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.840
There's something I want to confirm

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.140
regarding the intel from the last battle sequence...

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.180
Kakashi, you said that the reason why

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.260
you were able to travel through space time using Kamui,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.510
plus pull Eight Tails in and out almost whole,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.470
was thanks to receiving Nine Tails' chakra from Naruto, right?

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:49.760
Yes ...

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.220
To be more precise,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.680
I received that chakra directly from Nine Tails...

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.390
In reference to your choice of words, "Thanks to..."

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.930
How different was it

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.390
compared to using Kamui without Nine Tails' chakra?

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.260
Explain it to me in simple terms.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.390
I would say more than three times the power.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.890
I couldn't really hurl things that were very large

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.510
or do it very often before that.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.510
Almost done?

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:32.840
Humph... Looks like things have gone your way, Fourth Hokage!

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.590
NARUTO NINE TAILS' CHAKRA Until now, the only one who was able to link their chakra to mine

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.590
NARUTO NINE TAILS' CHAKRA was Naruto because he possesses Kushina's

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.140
NARUTO NINE TAILS' CHAKRA and because he has been my Jinchuriki for many years...

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.720
NINE TAILS' CHAKRA NARUTO NINJA NINJA And Naruto has matured to the point

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.090
NINE TAILS' CHAKRA NARUTO NINJA NINJA where he's skillful enough to sense and transmute my chakra

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:53.890
NINE TAILS' CHAKRA NARUTO NINJA NINJA to be compatible with other shinobi and then hand it over to them.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.930
NINE TAILS' CHAKRA NARUTO NINJA NINJA NINJA Though I can also help or use Naruto

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.930
NINE TAILS' CHAKRA NARUTO NINJA NINJA NINJA as an intermediary to give my chakra to anyone...

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.340
NINE TAILS' CHAKRA NARUTO NINJA NINJA NINJA NINJA The same exact way you handed over

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.550
NINE TAILS' CHAKRA NARUTO NINJA NINJA NINJA NINJA and inserted your own chakra into Naruto, Minato.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.510
He's already... Surpassed you both a while ago now.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.840
The amount of chakra he's linking and delivering

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.050
is on a completely different scale!

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.640
Kushina, Minato... You're pathetic!

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.640
You both pale in comparison to your brat Naruto!

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.840
But this is probably...

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.550
the power you wanted to give to Naruto.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.840
Heh... I should probably lend a little more power too.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.840
Damn it! He's pushing me back hard!

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.340
Naruto, now's your chance! Do it now!

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.590
Tailed Beast Bomb!

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:09.470
Beam of Light.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.050
- Eight Trigrams Wall of Air Palm! - Eight Trigrams Wall of Air Palm!

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.890
- Wind Style: Giant Casting Net! - Wind Style: Giant Casting Net!

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.760
I won't let Neji's death be in vain!

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.550
A curse mark that doesn't go away until you die...

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.140
A shinobi curse that Hyuga's main and branch families gave rise to...

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.050
An existence where one can only await one's death inside a cage.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.180
It's a nice analogy for our current situation.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.550
You're all exactly like that brat who just died a pointless death.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.340
Neji...

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.680
Neji's will...

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.180
isn't...

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.720
dead yet!

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.340
I'll take the right!

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.590
Gotcha!

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.680
Damn it! My shoulder's dislocated again!

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.510
Gentle Fist!

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.010
Go, Lee!
All right!

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.970
Unlike you guys, I don't want...

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.840
to sever any of my bonds... or get them cut off!

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.960
So this is it...

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.940
This place seems to be untouched.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.630
It's in shambles.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.340
Well, I suppose it is way outside the village.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.340
Which one is it?

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.900
Let's see, it should be around here somewhere.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.740
There it is.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.710
This place gives me the creeps...

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.340
If we've found what we were looking for,

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.380
let's get out of here!

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.130
Yes, let's go...

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.040
to where all the secrets sleep.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.210
Huh?

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.290
This place sure has changed a lot too.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.710
What's up with Sasuke?

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.380
He's just like how I was before I wanted to destroy Leaf.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.710
How so?

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.040
Even if both he and the village have changed,

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.920
this place is still his homeland.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.540
He needs some time to reaffirm his decision and resolve,

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:23.920
through immersing himself in sentimentality and by retracing the past.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.130
Hmm...

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.710
So you're over it already?

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.130
The whole immerse yourself in sentimentality

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.040
to affirm your resolve to destroy the Leaf thing.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.590
Hey, come to think of it,

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.540
we were all your cream of the crop subordinates, right?

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.170
And now... we're inside of the Leaf...

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.590
All the strong ones are gone because they're away fighting.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.630
Isn't this a perfect opportunity for you?

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.420
Perhaps, indeed...

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.130
Except for one thing...

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.590
You're no longer Hebi.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.340
Oh, you use a jutsu to remove the entry stone...

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.500
There's not even a trace of the Uchiha's Nakano Shrine...

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.380
The exterior doesn't matter. What's important is what's beneath.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.500
Let's go.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.130
Well then, I'm going to get started.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.840
It's best if you stand back.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.340
In order to perform what is written in the scroll,

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.630
first, the Death God's Mask is necessary.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.090
That is located in the Uzumaki Clan's Noh Mask Hall

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.920
on the outskirts of the Leaf Village.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.790
Then one must allow the Death God of the Reaper Death Seal

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.750
to possess oneself and guide it forth.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.000
Slice open the Death God's abdomen and the seal will come undone.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:27.170
Though I shall then end up a human sacrifice.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.250
However, it will also allow me to get back

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.130
both of my arms from inside the Death God's belly.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.380
They're mine again!

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.210
And if I can regain the power that lies in those arms,

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.630
I can perform the Reanimation.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.750
That's right... I can revive those four.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.130
Of course in that case,

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.420
you're well aware of what will then become necessary...

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.880
You're planning on using us as sacrifices for the Reanimation, aren't you?!

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.670
That's not such a bad idea,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.420
but we've actually got something even better than you guys.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.380
Though it's still invisible to you yet.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.880
Jugo, Sasuke, Suigetsu... Get ready!

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.290
Got it.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.380
Jugo, bestow upon Sasuke some of your Curse Mark Sage Power.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.210
And when you do, the Zetsu that Tobi stuck onto Sasuke to watch him

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.920
should respond and rise to the surface.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.040
Damn it! How did you--?!

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.920
I know your Hashirama cells inside and out from my experiments.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.670
Including how to detect you, of course.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.840
Six of you, huh? Tobi sure wasn't taking any chances!

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.340
When I reclaimed and reabsorbed my chakra from Kabuto,

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.380
all his intel was transferred inside me.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.920
And he'd thoroughly investigated the six Zetsu

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.380
that had been attached to Sasuke.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.340
I possess those four's DNA as well,

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.590
since I love collecting and storing knowledge too.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.840
Suigetsu, Jugo... Take care of the remaining two.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.000
Okay, Lord Orochimaru!

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.540
Reanimation Jutsu!

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.210
Now, here I come!

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.090
They, who are all-knowing...

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.040
The previous Hokage!

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.210
That's the First Hokage?

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.050
The real Hashirama who's been touted as a God of Shinobi?

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.050
No way... You solved how to undo that Sealing Jutsu?

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.920
Lord First, it appears we've been recalled into the world of the living.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.920
Hm? Who the hell are you?

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.000
Oh, uh... The Fourth Hokage, sir!

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:59.000
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The All-Knowing"

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.060
Oh! The Fourth, eh?!

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:08.900
THE ALL-KNOWING Tune in again!
