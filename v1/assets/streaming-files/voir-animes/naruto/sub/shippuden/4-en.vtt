00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.200
Wh-What's that?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.870
Just a little more.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.230
You're pretty good.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.270
Now that's a handy Jinchuriki.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.630
But...how'd you know I was the intruder?

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.730
There are no birds like that in this desert.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.530
I see.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.500
The Jinchuriki of the Sand 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.070
You're pretty good...

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.500
Now that's a handy Jinchuriki.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.300
But...how'd you know I was the intruder?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.700
There are no birds like that in this desert.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.600
I see.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.530
Hey! What was that noise earlier?!

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.070
You're supposed to report immediately if something happens...

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.570
Wh-What...happened?

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.300
Lord Kazekage...

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.700
What do you mean something strange got into the village?!

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.700
Captain Yura was supposed to have tightened village security.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.370
Actually... we have been unable to contact Captain Yura.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.930
Come again?!

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.970
Oh, man...That Deidara had to go and turn this into a circus.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.900
Yura.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.170
You head on back.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.200
Things will get complicated if the guys from the village find you here.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.300
Yes, Lord Sasori.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.670
Get a move on, Deidara.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.830
I don't like to be kept waiting.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.900
Gaara! I'm coming in!

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.770
Where'd he go...?

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.030
Kankuro, the Kazekage is fighting up in the sky.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.900
Wh-What did you say?

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.800
Gaara...!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.300
The covert action is a failure.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.400
But now...

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.800
I don't have to bother... looking for you anymore...!

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.130
He's got the advantage, as expected...

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.170
This is a real mess.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:59.930
Over there?!

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.000
This one is?!

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.830
A transformation of one of Naruto's Shadow Clones, huh?!

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.430
I'm finished if it even grazes me...

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.570
Shinobi Battle Skills, part three...

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.200
Ninjutsu!

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.000
The speed of his seal forming...

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.770
It's way too fast!

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.400
Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.900
Where's Kakashi Sensei?

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.970
Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu!

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.000
A Shadow Clone, huh?!

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.130
Water Style! Water Dragon Missile!

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.970
What?!

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.670
Using Fire Style, Earth Style and Water Style consecutively.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.500
Ordinarily that's totally impossible.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.370
He isn't called the "Copy Ninja" for nothing...

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.700
Now I understand how amazing he is.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.970
Yeah...

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.600
This is going to be a long-drawn-out affair.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.800
But there's still plenty of time until dawn.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:08.930
Yes, there is.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.000
Things might just be settled...

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.670
more quickly than you'd expect...

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.000
Gaara...

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.300
It's almost time...

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.330
The real show's about to begin.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.600
There!

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:37.200
He uses strange explosives... And he's able to guide them, huh?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.000
I've pretty much got it now.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.300
I always knew, but...

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.330
The Sharingan is really something else, isn't it?

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.400
Yeah...

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.500
But even more than that, the speed of his seal formation...

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.930
It's so fast it's tough for us to even get near him...

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.570
Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.630
Water Style! Water Dragon Jutsu!

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.000
For the time being,

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.930
we won't have a prayer of getting the bells

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.600
unless we can do something about both his hands.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:44.000
Yeah. That Kakashi Sensei's incredibly strong for sure.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.670
He's smarter than Shikamaru.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.600
He has a better sense of smell than Kiba.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.300
His Sharingan is better than Sasuke's.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.830
His Taijutsu is better than Bushy Brow's.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.330
And he's got way more... experience than us...

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.030
But even Kakashi Sensei must have a weakness!

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.100
If we think hard about it...

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.300
Hmm. A weakness, huh...?

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.730
Oh! He does... have a weakness?!

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.770
What?!

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.030
I never thought they'd make me use my Sharingan this much...

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.600
But, oh well...

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.430
I should be able to hang on until sunrise...

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.400
I've still got...Shuriken... and Kunai Knives.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.430
Whoops! Mustn't do that.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.130
This isn't like the old days.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.070
They're too good for me to be able to fight them while reading.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.670
But I want to know what happens.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.130
It seems the main character in "Make-Out Tactics"

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.770
has some sort of incredible secret...

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.230
I can't wait to read what's next...

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.200
R-Really?

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.730
Did you really figure out Kakashi Sensei's weakness?

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:25.630
You should be able to figure it out

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.970
if you look back on his actions up until now.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.930
Quit stalling already... What's his weakness, Naruto?

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.000
Well, you see...

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.730
I get it!

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.870
I never thought he'd have a weakness like that.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.200
See?! It's clear if you think back on his actions up until now, right?

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.630
Right, right.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.900
In addition to occupying both his hands,

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.330
we might be able to seal off his Sharingan if things go well.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.730
And then if we seize the opportunity... Naruto...

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.930
Sure enough, you're the number one most unpredictable Ninja!

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.330
Still, I was so pleased with how much they've grown

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.030
that I ended up getting kind of carried away...

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:17.570
I guess this time I'll wait and see what kind of move they'll make.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.030
Now that that's settled, the first strike will decide this!

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.130
We'll make the first move!

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.130
Right! Let's go!

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:32.930
All right.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.400
They're fast, this time.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800
Gaara!

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.000
They're here.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:24.930
You're underestimating me.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.900
To think you'd attack me head-on like that.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.830
Now, Naruto!

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.900
Here we go, Kakashi Sensei!

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.570
At the end of "Make-Out Tactics...!"

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.330
Wh-What?!

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.400
As it happens, the main character...!

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.130
He's giving away the ending! N-No!

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.600
Oh, no! I still understand what he's saying.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.070
I can read his lips with my Sharingan.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.030
Oh!

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.430
A Ninja is supposed to read below what's underneath.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.230
Right, Sensei?!

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.870
You got me...

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.230
It's just like an eggshell protecting what's inside.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.170
But it's incredible that he was able to block the explosion completely.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.670
Sand Prison!

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.130
Who'd have thought you'd ensnare Kakashi

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.400
by pretending to give away the ending.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.730
That's a pretty good strategy.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.470
- You could say that. - But if I remember correctly,

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.870
Master Jiraiya's book is targeted for adults, right?

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.670
So when did you become an adult?

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.770
That doesn't count as reading.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.100
It was so boring I quit after just ten pages...

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:56.630
It seems he read ten pages.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.330
- Okay, you're guilty! - Huh?!

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.100
Naruto, for violating the regulations,

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.870
you are sentenced to clean the Academy bathrooms for three days!

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.100
No way!

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.800
Next episode: "The Kazekage Stands Tall"
