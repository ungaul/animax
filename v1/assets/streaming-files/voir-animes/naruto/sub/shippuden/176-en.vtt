WEBVTT

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.530
It seems like there are a lot fewer guards around.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.820
We could make a run for it now.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.280
Let's look for Sasuke.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.610
You go on ahead. I'm going to look for my blade.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.480
I found the key right away,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.650
but my blade is nowhere to be found.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.610
They confiscated it, right? Then look in their armory.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.690
Let's go.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.070
What? You're going to help me?

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.150
You're all right, Jugo. Unlike that Karin.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.530
Speaking of which, where'd she go?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.280
Want to look for her?

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.820
Without her around, it's a little too quiet…

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.530
What should we do?

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.230
I'm beginning to understand how the enemy is coordinating this.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.320
Now it's my turn!

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.230
I'm not so naïve…

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.730
as to allow the enemy to act.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.070
– Summoning Jutsu! – Summoning Jutsu!

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.940
No way. Don't tell me…

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.320
That's…

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.320
The past members of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.110
Among the legendary Seven Ninja Swordsmen…

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.150
they've chosen the strongest ones!

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.190
The Seven Ninja Swordsmen…

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.110
Nothing on the Ensui Platoon?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.570
They'll be here shortly.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.030
Maki of the Hidden Sand, what about you?

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.150
We're ready to roll!

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.610
All right, buy some time for Ensui's platoon.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.980
Everyone, attack together!

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.480
It's not here either.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.900
You said you're gathering all the lost Hidden Mist Blades.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.480
Why are you so obsessed?

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.860
What?

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.230
You said you'd help me. Don't tell me you're giving up?

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.400
You're the one who gives up.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.030
Except when it comes to the ninja blades.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.030
I need one thing to keep me going.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.650
Resurrecting the Seven Ninja Swordsmen

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.570
and becoming their leader is my dream.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.110
Resurrect?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.570
Yeah.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.650
Right now, the Seven Ninja Swordsmen consists

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.570
of a single brat named Chojuro.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.730
Traditionally, the ninja blade is

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.110
passed down from generation to generation.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.230
Right now, there is only one blade, known as the Hiramekarei.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.690
Nothing else.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.030
The great blade, Samehada, is in Kisame's possession,

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.320
but he's a rogue ninja.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.650
I finally got a hold of the Executioner's Blade,

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.940
only to lose it.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.320
So officially, that unit doesn't exist today.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.070
For now, anyway…

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.530
The First and Last Opponent It's no use.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.940
No matter how many times we attack, it has no effect.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.230
What do we do against guys like that?

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.150
They're the Seven Ninja Swordsmen!

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.900
The longer we keep this up, the greater our disadvantage.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.110
Don't worry so much!

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.780
The Reanimation Jutsu can be stopped

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.610
by sealing away the soul or immobilizing their body.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.730
And other than Zabuza, no one is wielding a sword.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.650
That cuts their strength in half.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.110
No.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.860
It seems they brought their swords.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.480
Not all of them have one.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.780
The mist is getting even thicker…

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.860
We can't see through this.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.610
And there's no sound with Silent Killing.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.360
We can't even hear them.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.570
We must do something about this mist,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.190
or the Allied Forces are at a disadvantage.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.320
You have a plan?

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.190
I'm preparing it now.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.690
Then I'll leave you to handle it!

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.150
Lee! Go after the Scorch Style! I'll take the Explosion Style!

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.530
Understood!

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:52.730
Captain Kakashi!

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.480
I'm ready with my Shadow Possession and Shadow Paralysis!

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.530
All right, fasten it to me.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.530
Ensui, reduce the strength of the Shadow Possession,

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.610
and stay focused on my movements.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.860
Right!

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.570
Santa Yamanaka, use the Mind Transfer Jutsu

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.820
to trade places with me.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.070
With your sensory skills,

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.730
you will be able to track and find Zabuza in this mist!

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.820
Right!

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.480
Once you perceive Zabuza, since I'll be under Shadow Possession,

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.280
guide me to a location where I can see him.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.650
Get me behind him as close as you can.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.190
When I have a clear sight of him,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.530
immediately release the Mind Transfer Jutsu

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.730
and return me to my body.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.320
I will grapple with Zabuza and step on his shadow

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.400
and get him into position.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.780
At that point, Ensui, immediately increase the power

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.110
of your Shadow Possession and Shadow Stitching Jutsu

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.570
and bind him!

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.400
Then Maki, completely immobilize Zabuza with your Cloth Paralysis Jutsu!

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.400
Yes!

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:51.860
Let's do this!
Right!

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.440
Mind Transfer Jutsu!

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.400
We're going to guard Captain Kakashi!

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.610
Right!

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.570
Anyway, there are lots of other blades.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.110
Among the Ninja Swordsmen throughout history,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.030
there were super masters besides Kisame, Zabuza and Chojuro.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.440
First…

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.610
there's the wielder of the Lightning Blade, the Fang,

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.150
a blade swathed with lightning with the ultimate cutting edge…

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.400
Ameyuri Ringo.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.190
The wielder of…

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.820
the Blunt Blade, Kabutowari, that smashes through any defense…

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.400
Jinin Akebino.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.820
The blade that stabs and pierces everything

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.190
and sews them together…

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.320
the Long Blade, the Sewing Needle.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.730
Its wielder is Kushimaru Kuriarare.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.190
The blade that adds explosive power to one's swordsmanship…

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.150
the Explosive Blade: the Splatter.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.530
And its wielder, Jinpachi Munashi.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.480
And the one who, like Kisame Hoshigaki,

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.030
wielded the Great Blade, Samehada… Fuguki Suikazan.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.980
And the one who could handle all seven blades.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.650
The one known as the second coming of the demon, my older brother…

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.530
Mangetsu Hozuki.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.980
And I am going to be the captain of the new generation

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.230
of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen, and…

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.030
Enough. You're talking too loud.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.030
Hey, I was coming to the climax.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.820
The sword you broke in two, right?

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.440
Shouldn't you just make a new sword?

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.900
You don't know a thing.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.110
That blade has a certain power.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.110
The Severing Sword, the Executioner's Blade,

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.610
cannot be chipped or nicked.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.110
No, a better way to put it is, the blade repairs itself.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.860
It cuts into humans, then absorbs their blood.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.480
It regenerates itself with the iron present in blood.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.230
All right! Found him!

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.980
Mind Transfer Jutsu, release!

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.690
Good luck, Captain Kakashi!

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.530
All right!

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.730
He hasn't noticed me.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.730
I can do this!

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.570
Splendid, Haku.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.530
I didn't expect him to jump in to save Zabuza.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.690
The boy… is already dead.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.980
Zabuza's Hidden Mist style is necessary in order to battle many.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.360
So I knew that Zabuza would be their target.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.110
To protect him, the rest can be mere shields.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.150
And Haku will protect Zabuza with his life.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.480
Even though he is simply a puppet now.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.900
It must be quite a performance out there on the battlefield.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.150
He intends to slash me along with the boy?!

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.650
Captain Kakashi!

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.290
Damn it… If we can't hear them or even see them…

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.250
Isn't Captain Kakashi here yet?!

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.920
I put a shadow on one enemy!

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.130
There hasn't been enough contact time with the second shadow!

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.210
I can't stop his movements!

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.670
Contact time?

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.290
Don't tell me Zabuza cut down Captain Kakashi?!

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.130
Give me another A-rank mission?!

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.540
No way!

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.420
Zabuza and Haku…

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.670
I can't believe everyone came out unscathed

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.830
against such strong ninja.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.290
Huh…

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.380
Well, learn more jutsu and train to become stronger.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.500
Then you can tackle A-rank missions.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.710
You're right about learning more jutsu.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.670
But I've also got to find other things that I want to protect.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.790
Haku said to me…

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.540
when a person has something precious they want to protect,

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.380
they can truly become strong

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.670
I see… So do you feel the same way?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.130
Yeah!

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.630
After watching Haku and Zabuza, I started to believe that.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.710
Hey, hey…

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.000
Kakashi Sensei, what do you think about this?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.330
About what?

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.380
I'm glad you were Naruto's first adversaries.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.500
Maki, stay behind me and

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.630
stand by with your Cloth Paralysis Jutsu!

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.580
Right!

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.540
Why?

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.790
Why can't I keep up?

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.460
Damn it!

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.790
You can't possibly defeat me the way you are now.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.580
What was that?!

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.540
You still don't realize…

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.130
Zabuza…

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.630
That time, you hesitated killing Haku

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:27.460
and you couldn't hide the unrest in your heart over Haku's death.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.830
But it's different this time.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.330
You're just a tool with no feelings.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.710
Let's put an end to a fight like this!

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.540
Hey, hey… Kakashi Sensei.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.460
What do you think about this?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.080
About what?

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.580
Well, those two were enemies…

00:15:53.080 --> 00:16:00.130
I…liked those guys.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.880
Is that weird?

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.670
No.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:15.710
I feel the same way.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.920
Ensui! Bind him!

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.960
That's my signal! Okay!

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.580
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.420
The way you died and your tears…

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.330
demonstrated your bond to each other.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.420
I have many things I want to protect as a shinobi.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.290
Zabuza and Haku…

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.000
Protecting the way they died is one of those things.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.580
Especially since I am their final enemy.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.580
Naruto… What do you think?

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.580
Now, Maki!

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:41.630
Right!

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460
Damn it!

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.250
This is…

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.500
The mist is clearing…

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.880
All right! Now we can see the enemy!

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.000
If these tags remain, they cannot be summoned.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.710
I will keep an eye on these two bodies.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.250
All right…

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.000
The Reanimation Jutsu… This is an unforgivable jutsu!

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.920
Sai, next we'll use your Sealing Jutsu from the Foundation!

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.500
You're up!

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.170
But…But I still haven't mastered that jutsu…

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.420
Isn't it a fact that you were highly regarded by Danzo?

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.500
There's no need to suppress your emotions anymore!

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.380
Well… It takes me a while to get upset too…

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.130
But this time, my boiling point was low.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.330
Copy Ninja Kakashi has copied a thousand jutsu…

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.630
And I'm going to use them to their fullest extent!

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.580
Attack!

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.080
Fang Over Fang!

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.380
Hidden Jutsu! Beetle Sphere!

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.000
Eight Trigrams Air Palm!

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.000
Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.290
Neji!

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.920
There are too many of them…

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.420
So they absorb chakra…

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.000
Gentle Fist Technique… Body Blow!

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.630
One after another… There's no end to them!

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.630
Stop whining and move!

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.580
Each one is strong and persistent!

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.540
This is attrition warfare.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:01.710
Captain Kitsuchi!

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.000
We have word from Headquarters!

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.500
Several thousand have gotten past us!

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.630
Dad!

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.420
Quiet! I know!

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.330
Here they come.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.680
Who are these two?!

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.890
They're bathed in Nine Tails' chakra!

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.730
It's incredible!

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.600
There's no mistake!

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.100
It's the Gold and Silver Brothers of the Hidden Cloud.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.980
And even Dan is with them?

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.680
Well, now that it's come to this,

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.600
I guess I'm the only one who can face him.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.310
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Brilliant Military Advisor of the Hidden Leaf"

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.390
THE BRILLIANT MILITARY ADVISOR OF THE HIDDEN LEAF What should we do?

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.020
THE BRILLIANT MILITARY ADVISOR OF THE HIDDEN LEAF

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.770
Tune in again!
