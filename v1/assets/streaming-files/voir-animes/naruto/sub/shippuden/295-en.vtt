00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.750
UNOFFICIAL LEAF VILLAGE MASCOT KONORIN Hey Ino…you here?

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.040
Yeah? What are you two doing together?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.750
Remember what Kakashi Sensei said last time?

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.170
I am giving you a secret mission

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.670
in which you shall each prepare a congratulatory gift for

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.380
Naruto and Hinata's wedding.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.170
Of course!

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.830
And? What about it?

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.790
Oh… I thought we'd discuss what to get them.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.040
Oh, sorry!

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.040
I've got something great picked out already

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.130
and I'm about to go to the store.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.000
Which store? We'll go with you!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.080
No, you aren't!

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.000
We can't get gifts from the same store.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.920
You two can think of something on your own!

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.880
Later!

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.530
What are we gonna do?

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.490
Excuse me, Miss!

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.370
I'd like to get some ice cream for dessert.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.490
What about you, Shikamaru?

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.780
None for me.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.120
You sure can eat, though…

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.870
Your appetite hasn't changed since you were a kid.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.170
But these days, I've started liking thigh meat,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.090
as well as meat that's really rare,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.250
so I think I'm going towards more grown-up tastes.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.760
So it's your taste buds?

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.840
Anyway, getting back to the subject.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.760
Maybe yuzu sorbet would've been better than ice cream…

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.060
No! I'm talking about the wedding gift for Naruto and Hinata!

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.980
Oh that.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.810
Here's your ice cream.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.020
Oh, it's here!

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.320
Judging from Ino's attitude, she'll be no help…

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.650
If this keeps going,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.860
we might be the only ones who can't find a present.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.240
What do you mean by "we"?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.830
I've already picked something out.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.960
R-Really?! What are you getting?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.420
I'm thinking about giving them this.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.960
SATOCHO DINNER GIFT CERTIFICATE Hey, this is a—!

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.630
SATOCHO DINNER GIFT CERTIFICATE Yup, a gift certificate for a dinner!

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.260
And it's not just for an average diner!

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.310
It's a gift certificate for a super-fancy teahouse

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.640
that VIPs like the Hokage go to!

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.230
Well, it is a special occasion…

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.440
What's going on?!

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.440
This is Choji… And he chose the perfect gift!

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.740
Having dinner in a restaurant you wouldn't normally be able to go to

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.410
is special and really memorable for a couple!

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.620
Not a lot of gifts would have as much impact!

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.200
And even if this was for a special occasion…

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.540
Choji's willing to part with a gift certificate

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.170
to a super-fancy restaurant, just like that?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.920
Miss, may I have another bowl of ice cream?

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.500
Are you really the Choji I know?!

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.840
It's not just your taste buds that grew up.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.970
Have you completely become an adult?

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.300
What?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.350
Here's your ice cream.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.140
It just happened to be a three-for-one special.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.810
Why is it three to a group?

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.230
Usually a romantic dinner is for two.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.900
You'd think a fancy restaurant would be aware of that!

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.610
Choji will tag along if it's three to a group!

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.120
Shikamaru? What's wrong, Shikamaru?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.490
It's nothing… Are you planning to go too?

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.870
Are you joking?

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.580
Even I know better than to tag along with some newlyweds…

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.330
R-Right? Of course you would.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.920
I was gonna ask the waitress to seat me at a different table.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.880
So, you ARE going?!

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.930
Still, this is not the time to get on Choji's case.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.810
I still haven't decided to what to get them.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.470
And I can't waste a minute on deciding.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.230
I'm thinking… something useful.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.560
A decorative item would just get in the way if it's not to their taste.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.730
Flowers or food would be gone eventually,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.110
and it would seem like a seasonal gift.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.280
Sending them something is really risky…

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.950
So that leaves…cash!

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.870
That's not a bad idea.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.240
They can get whatever they want,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.450
and it's way better than getting something they won't use

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.710
or something that's identical to someone else's gift.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.250
But wait a minute…

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.340
What if I'm the only one giving them cash?

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.050
It's not a lot, but please accept it!

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.010
Not good!

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.260
Everyone will think I was the only one too lazy

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.180
to go out and buy a gift and

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.430
just gave them cash without thinking.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.430
Shikamaru, you okay?

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.770
U-Uh, yeah… I just felt a chill.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.190
Sorry, did you get cold from watching me eat

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.020
all that ice cream?

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.610
That's not it…

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.820
I got hot from eating all that barbecue,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.860
so it was just what I needed.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.780
Besides, I'm the kinda guy who can eat ice cream

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.240
even if I'm traveling in snow country!

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.830
My appetite beats the cold every time.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.790
Damn it, no one can beat your appetite—

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.620
Choji! What did you just say?!

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.880
My appetite beats the cold?

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.670
No, before that!

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.880
What about snow country?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.920
Oh…

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.880
I can eat ice cream even if I'm traveling in snow country…

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.760
That's it!

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.810
Steam and Food Pills

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.770
A honeymoon?

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.980
Yeah… I'm gonna gift Naruto and Hinata a honeymoon.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.770
So where are you off to now?

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.860
I have to decide on a place, and go check it out.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.660
And I need to get a woman's point of view

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.160
so I can get a sense of what Hinata might like.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.370
If only Ino were here…

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.910
There she is!

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.840
H-Hey… It's been awhile… ever since that day, huh?

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.260
Y-Yeah.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.760
What are you guys up to?

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.970
Uh, stuff…We just had some lunch. And you?

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.770
I'm here to discuss the Chunin Exams

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.730
and making my rounds to people… O-Oh…that so?

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.730
What the hell?!

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.820
I thought you meant Ino was there…

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.820
You said a "woman's point of view,"

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.200
so it doesn't have to be Ino.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.490
But she's a warrior-type to the core.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.910
I can't talk to her about a wedding gift… What?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.370
A honeymoon as a wedding gift?

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.090
Talk about a silly and pathetic idea.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.340
I just know she'd say something like that.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.340
Wouldn't that apply to Ino as well?

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.390
Hey, what're you two whispering about?

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.470
Oh, it's nothing…

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.980
I think Shikamaru wants to talk to you about something.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.640
T-Talk to me?

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.440
Maybe…next time… we can go get a bite to eat.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.530
T-Talk about what?

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.490
Damn it, Choji!

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.780
I can't come out and say something like,

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.620
"It's no use talking to Temari about honeymoons."

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.870
Well… I guess have no choice…

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.000
Well, you see…

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.590
I'm seriously thinking about a honeymoon.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.960
So, if it were you, where would you like to go?

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.800
Huh?!

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.720
A-A honeymoon?!

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.760
W-What's the matter?

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840
N-Nothing.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.800
A honeymoon, huh?

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.480
W-Why would you ask me that?

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.810
Huh? Well, I just figured…

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.520
Wait a second.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.610
I can't come out and say it really doesn't matter who,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.280
I just need a woman's opinion, can I?

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.280
I figured you'd be the best one to ask.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.740
I-I'm the best one?

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.030
I-I see.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.700
O-Okay then, I'll hear you out.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.580
O-Oh…

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.590
Well, I thought a hot spring would be nice and relaxing…

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.050
Does that sound like something an old man would like?

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.090
No, a hot spring sounds great!

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.180
Really? Awesome!

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.770
Good food and hot springs… perfect, right?

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.690
Good. At least I got confirmation. So now…

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.940
Now you have to choose where, right?

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.820
Huh? Oh, yeah.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.030
Maybe we can check some out.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.110
It's still early. Why not go now?

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.530
Yeah, that's true. Then… I'm going to Amaguriama.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.780
So why don't you two go?

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.910
Huh?!

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.500
Sorry, I just have to have some dessert after eating!

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.000
You just ate!

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.000
I always save room for dessert.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.010
You just filled that room earlier!

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.340
You idiot!

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.930
Because of Choji's big mouth,

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.350
Temari's standing there red-faced and upset!

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.930
Sorry, Choji didn't mean to get you upset or anything.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.190
Since we're talking about honeymoons,

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.900
he figured there's no sense I go alone.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.860
Yeah, that's right.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.530
A honeymoon is meant for two, so you guys should go.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.700
Okay, you two. I'm off.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.820
Hey, uh…Mr. C-Choji?!

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.120
What am I supposed to do now?

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.380
I'll go with you.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.210
Huh?

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.430
How did it turn out like this?

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.810
W-What's with this strange nervousness?

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.560
Anyway, I never expected Temari to help me out

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.940
with choosing a wedding gift for Naruto and Hinata.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.860
However… Why is she so silent all of a sudden?

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.480
I can't get a read on her at all!

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.190
First, I have to get her out of her bad mood.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.110
W-Well… Since we're out…

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.530
should we stop by a couple places?

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.370
O-Oh, sure…

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.620
HIT THE TARGET

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.380
That's rare of you to miss.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.760
What?!

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.730
Sorry… This was all I could win.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.730
I'm not completely sure,

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.400
but I think she's in a good mood now.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.540
Thank goodness! It's still here!

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.920
I knew it was the perfect wedding gift.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.750
It's cute and simple.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.300
It's one of a kind!

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.970
I had to get money from my savings,

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.050
but I know Hinata will love it!

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.560
Anyway, my wedding gift to them is set!

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.520
I-Ino… Imagine seeing you here.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.270
I can say the same about you.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.520
– No way! – She isn't—!

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.820
B-By the way, have you seen Naruto lately?

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.490
No, not at all.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.820
Imagine that, Naruto getting married.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.030
He used to be crazy about you long ago.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.330
That was back when we were kids.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.910
I'm really happy he and Hinata are together.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.830
There's no mistake… She's also…

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.790
– planning on that for a wedding gift! – planning on that for a wedding gift!

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.090
I have to get this picture frame before her!

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.800
But how…?

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.430
Hey Sakura, were you planning on getting this

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.140
for Naruto and Hinata?

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.430
Huh?

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.810
That's right! I have to provoke her

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.860
and make her too proud to buy it.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.650
That's impossible, right?

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.530
You wouldn't get something that tacky, would you?

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.410
I'm not gonna fall for it.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.990
This woman's trying to diss that picture frame,

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.830
so I won't buy it.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.790
What are you talking about?

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.290
You were totally about to buy it earlier… Th-That's…

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.880
Why would you even think about buying something tacky? How stupid!

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.050
Stupid?!

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.720
I didn't say I was going to buy it!

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.300
I was just gonna move it out of the way

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.680
because it's trash.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.730
Really, you may have brute strength,

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.810
but you have no taste at all!

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.440
Brute strength?!

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.610
Talk about a lame comparison!

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.980
Excuse me!

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.940
You're annoying the other customers.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.320
See, Ino!

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.740
You're annoying the others!

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.990
You're the one who's yelling!

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.580
You started it!

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.830
This is mine!

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:33.750
Hey, that's mine!

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.460
I found it first!

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:40.210
Now, now… Please don't pull so hard, or else—!

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.420
– Shut up! – Shut up!

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.380
You've got some nerve!

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.810
Because of you, we got kicked out!

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.430
That's my line!

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.940
You have no sense of mutual compromise!

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.810
You have no regard for anyone, you have no chest,

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.020
all you have is brute strength!

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.230
Huh?!

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.940
My chest has nothing to do with this!

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.950
There is nothing you can beat me in,

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.070
so you always try to bring up something unrelated! You should stop that.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.700
I don't know the meaning of not winning.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.830
And I win hands down in femininity.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.120
Feminine?!

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.120
You? How?

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.750
Now, now… Stop your fighting, you two.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.960
Choji! Perfect timing!

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.090
Who's more feminine? Me or Sakura?!

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.930
You can't just ask something like that out of the blue…

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.140
Even your own teammate, Choji, won't pick you. How sad!

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.180
Huh?!

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.980
Choji's not on your team,

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.640
but he won't even try to flatter you. That is so sad!

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.560
H-Hey, cut it out.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.320
Hmm… Okay then…

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.320
If you want to know, why don't you put it to a test.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:47.900
– A test? – A test?

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.570
Personally, I think someone who can cook is very feminine.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.830
So maybe you should see who cooks better?

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.080
Okay, let's begin the challenge!

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.630
The one who makes the tastiest food pills wins.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.960
You just watch, Sakura.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.590
I know what you like and dislike.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.840
I just have to make something that'll make you gag.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.340
The judge will be Choji.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.970
Huh?! You're not going to eat it?!

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.180
Fine with me!

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.930
I just ate a mountain of ice cream,

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.060
but I always have room for food pills!

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.900
W-Wait!

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.940
Choji's my teammate.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.860
That gives me the edge!

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.280
You should be okay with having the advantage…

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:31.990
Don't tell me…

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.910
You weren't planning to poison them to make me sick, were you?

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.660
Like I would!

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.750
Come on, let's get started!

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.290
Okay, without further ado!

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.330
The food pill contest to see who's more feminine, begins!

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.000
Ready, fight!

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.970
Whoa, what's this?!

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.970
Instead of using a mortar and pestle,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.810
she uses her fine chakra control

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.890
to get the ingredients to the desired size.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.100
I can't wait to taste the sensation

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.850
when I put it in my mouth!

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.650
Whoa!

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.650
She's searing the ingredients with super-fire power!

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.900
Sakura is using some legendary golden honey.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.120
Ino is using cacao powder.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.780
Both seem irresistible!

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.870
Th-This is…?!

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.010
Th-This is…

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:35.930
Yummy!

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.470
So delicious!

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.970
Rich, yet not too overpowering… That indescribable something

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.680
that explodes when it hits your tongue…

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.940
That delicate aroma and taste that lingers…

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.190
It's a treasure chest of sweetness!

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.650
Choji!

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.190
So? Which is it?

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.690
Which one tastes better?

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.650
Oh, I wolfed both down, so I can't tell.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.160
But they were both really…good…

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.830
– Choji! – Choji!

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.460
Choji! Choji!

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.970
I've made a lot of friends too.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.060
Noooo!

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.690
Choji! Don't die!

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:27.850
What's happening?

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.860
Is his life flashing before his eyes?

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.820
Ino!

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.320
You did used poison, didn't you?!

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.900
You know I wouldn't!

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.910
Just who do you think I am, anyway?!

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.740
I've made…a lot of friends… This is bad!

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.240
Choji's delirium is getting worse!

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.040
What are you doing?

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.960
I have to see what's inside it before I can treat him.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.840
If there's poison in it, my tongue will go numb…

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.260
I told you, there's no poison inside!

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:56.880
Damn it!

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:00.890
It's delicious!

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.850
Uh-huh!
Why?

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.720
I really love this taste.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.560
Me too! I love this flavor!

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.020
Boy, that surprised me.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.610
I ate too many sweets… Seems my blood sugar shot up.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.030
But I'm okay now!

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.490
Is that all?

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.900
Thank goodness.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.860
Hey, Ino.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.410
Why would you go out of the way to make something I love?

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:22.950
Well…

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.620
I figured if I surprised you with a flavor you'd love, I'd win.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.870
What, really?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.830
That was my strategy too!

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.960
Huh?! You too?

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.840
No wonder I love how it tastes!

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.220
Ultimately, we saw right through each other.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.640
Okay, since we know each other so well,

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.350
there's something I want to say to you.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.520
What is it?

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.350
Don't you think we'd find something even better

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.020
if we looked for a wedding gift together?

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.900
What now?

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.820
I was thinking the same thing.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.660
TOMIYA That inn seems nice.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.830
Huh?

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.620
I'd better hurry up and choose or

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.830
I'll just keep mulling over this wedding gift.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.870
I just have to pick something!

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.670
Okay. Let's go in!

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.830
Huh?!

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.840
What's the matter?

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.300
Weren't we just going to… look around?

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.920
Yeah, but we have to go inside or we can't make a decision.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.840
No, but… I'm not mentally prepared…

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.890
What? Mentally prepared?

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.560
Is she panicking because this place too fancy?

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.980
It's okay.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.980
Temari, let's just go inside and then we can decide.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.440
I-It'll be too late once we go inside!

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.320
I might get caught up in the mood…

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.650
What's she talking about? The mood?

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.530
The mood of that inn?

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.610
What does she mean by getting caught up in it?

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.030
I don't get it!

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.160
Hey…you don't…

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.580
…have a fever, do you?

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.250
I-I'm going home!

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.670
H-Hey, wait! It's gonna get dark soon!

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.250
If you're not feeling well,

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.050
we really should book a room and rest!

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.960
Please wait!

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.760
I really…need you!

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.970
Are you sure…I'm the one?

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.770
Yeah! You're the only one!

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.020
Besides, I can't go into the women's bath.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.070
What?

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.900
Temari, I need you to go into the women's bath

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.990
and report back every detail to me.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.070
That's all. Easy, right?

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.240
So, uh… Just what is this all about anyway?

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.500
What else? I'm going to gift Naruto and Hinata

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.670
a honeymoon for their wedding gift,

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:35.960
and I need to choose the inn.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.380
Oh… So that's it.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.960
Huh? Didn't I…tell you?

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.340
This is the first I've heard about it.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.810
ICHIRAKU RAMEN

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.560
So, you're back to square one

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.810
in your search for a wedding gift?

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.940
Yeah… But I think it turned out for the best.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.570
What about you, Shikamaru?

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.860
Trying to explain everything is a drag…

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.910
22 MORE DAYS UNTIL THE WEDDING

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.960
It's Naruto's wedding! Hinata's madly in love!

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.970
I'm jealous! Fool, ya fool! The wedding gift, I gotta prepare…

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.050
For those two, something extravagant.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.430
If it's too expensive, let's split it!

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.470
This makes me wanna get married too!

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.430
I can do it! I'll be the next one up!

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.520
I'm so popular, I'm on the verge of bursting!

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.900
For real… I'm on the frontlines of romance!

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.860
Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:08.810
