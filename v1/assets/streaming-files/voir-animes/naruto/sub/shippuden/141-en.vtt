WEBVTT

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.270
It appears to be a jutsu where a seed-like clone

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.670
parasitizes a life form with chakra and feeds on its host's chakra.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.770
So that's why you didn't notice it.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.430
Most likely a ninjutsu of the Akatsuki we saw at the meeting.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.370
And what about the other one who has been following us all along?

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.170
He continues to tail us.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.470
Probably the Byakugan user from the Hidden Mist.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.430
Him?

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.000
There.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.330
It would be a stroke of luck if he falls for this.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.230
Your traps are special. It'll work.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.100
Dead or alive, make sure you gouge out his right eye.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.400
Yes, sir!

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.230
Kisame Hoshigaki, pleased to meet you after the fact.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.200
Kisame Hoshigaki, eh?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.730
Ink in your mouth…

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.000
The rumors are true. You really are an octopus brat.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.600
I’m gonna make you weep! You sharky creep!

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.600
A Tailed Beast Cloak with only seven chakra tails…

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.870
Does this mean you're going to get serious?

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.270
Did you know?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.830
Know what?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.070
Octopi eat sharks!

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.500
The sword dodged on its own!

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.770
Bee!

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.400
That sword sucked out Bee's chakra again

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.930
and has grown even bigger!

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.200
This time, the shark shall devour the octopus.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.070
That sword Samehada's got a big appetite and it's a speed-eater,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.930
but it looks like it can only devour six tails' worth of chakra at one time.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.730
If that's the situation with this version,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.030
then my next version should do the trick.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.800
Samehada has never grown this big before.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.700
Its delight is not trivial either.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.570
What'll we do, Bee?

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.130
I'll help. Enter Tailed Beast State!

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.230
Judging from the markings, Ao went this way.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.730
Let us hurry.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.770
Yes, ma'am!

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.630
Tailed Beast vs. The Tailless Tailed Beast

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.430
Take care of my body, Torune.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.670
A booby trap. It must be Danzo's.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.900
CURSE

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.300
Why am I seeing my own body?!

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.430
Gotcha.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.170
What's going on?

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.700
You are under my Mind Transfer Puppet Curse Jutsu.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.370
Damn it! Was this a curse-type Mind Transfer Jutsu

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.470
that activates itself when the object is attacked?!

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.730
Your mind is now sealed inside that puppet.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.970
And I am in possession…

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.070
of your body.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.730
Damn it. It's useless.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.670
Forget it.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.200
That is a Barrier Ninjutsu that only us Hidden Mist Black Ops,

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.800
the Shinobi Tracking Unit, can undo.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.330
My Byakugan is precious, the only one that the Mist possesses.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.000
Do not think that you'll be able to reclaim it easily.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.470
So it self-activates when the eye is at risk, eh?

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.830
A fitting jutsu coming from you guys,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.800
also known as the Undertaker Squad.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.870
I don't expect it to be easy.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.230
Taking your eye means that I, as the jutsu caster, will lose my own eye.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.130
You know that.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.830
So it's Danzo's orders?

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.970
Just what does he think of his subordinates?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.530
If the Mist's military power becomes greatly diminished because of it,

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.400
losing one of my eyes is a cheap price to pay.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.970
Though, thanks to your barrier, it's not going to happen at this rate.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.630
But there are plenty of other options.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.000
Enter Tailed Beast State, Bee!

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.700
No way, fool, ya fool!

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.030
An attack with you would be way too huge

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.700
and would destroy the area.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.170
Master Kin and Ponta are here with us, don't forget!

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.200
Besides, I finally managed to sneak off under the radar.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.800
If I let you out, it'll be like announcing that Killer Bee is here!

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.000
It's not like you to make excuses, Bee!

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.800
So what'll you do? Fight in Version 2 State?

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.770
Oh yeah.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.800
‘Cept most of my chakra got taken away during those last few exchanges,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.930
so lend me yours.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.500
If it weren't for me, you'd have lost a long time ago.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.300
Ya sure got a cheeky personality,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.630
but I'm still grateful for your hospitality, yeah!

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.270
Huh?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.130
Going into a Tailed Beast State, eh?

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.930
No, this is a Tailed Beast's power trapped in a humanoid form.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.600
It's Version 2 State!

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.400
Lariat!

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.430
Samehada is so excited it's tripping out.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.830
The chakra earlier is nothing compared to this volume and quality.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.800
I'm amazed he can control this much chakra without losing his mind.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.970
There's no way to devour this much chakra.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.130
You did it!

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.830
I can't believe I was reduced back to Version 1 State.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.430
He's still alive! Hurry and finish him!

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.770
You've sure done it.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.730
What is that?!

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.800
The stronger my opponent, the stronger I become.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.270
I do not tire.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.600
I do not fall.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.670
So his blade steals his enemy's chakra

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.670
and transfers it to its master in the form of stamina?

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:55.830
And that's why I'm called the Tailless Tailed Beast.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.230
Water Style: Super Exploding Water Shock Wave!

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.270
What do you plan to do?

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.230
I'm simply going to jump down and behead you.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.430
If I can't remove your eye,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.000
then I'll just have to take your entire head back to the Leaf with me.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.470
You're going to kill yourself?

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.900
No. I'll undo this Mind Transfer Jutsu just before the blade cuts your neck.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.800
Either way, you'll die.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:31.600
And I, back in my body, can retrace my steps here to grab your head.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.530
Fine. Just make sure you're careful.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.400
Or else you'll fail.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.170
What do you mean?

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.700
Because if you get nervous and release that jutsu an instant too soon,

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.970
I'll defend myself from your sickle!

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.530
If I'm not dead,

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.670
the tables will be turned when you come to get my head.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.870
Remember that.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.470
Saved.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.100
What happened?

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.470
I was caught in the enemy's jutsu and couldn't move my body.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.200
If you hadn't come, I would be dead.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.570
That was a very close call.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.830
I'm sorry I made you worry.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.930
Couldn't move?

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.630
It must have been a genjutsu or something.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.600
It was a type of Mind Transfer Jutsu.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.300
Your right eye…

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.030
The enemy was after the Byakugan, weren't they?

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.430
They almost succeeded in smashing it.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.700
I'm sorry, but can you untie me?

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.770
Of course.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.200
I'll also undo that jutsu protecting your right eye.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.030
Thank you, that will help.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.100
What is that?

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.470
No!

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.530
He hasn't undone the Mind Transfer Jutsu yet!

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.000
She fell for it.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.230
If the Mizukage can undo the jutsu protecting this right eye,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.400
I couldn't ask for anything better.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.830
I can destroy the Byakugan and then undo the Mind Transfer Jutsu.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.730
He must be that Sensory-Type ninja! This was his plan all along!

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.030
No, Lady Mizukage!

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.370
This should do.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.300
Lady Mizukage?

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.530
Lend me your Hiramekarei, Chojuro.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.300
Huh?

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.670
You are not Ao.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.600
I cannot undo the jutsu on that right eye.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.600
Ao knows that well.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.700
Besides, Ao would never apologize to Chojuro.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.970
You played me… you sly old vixen—

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.370
Ow!

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.430
I-I wasn't the one who said that…ma'am.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.170
Oh, you're back to normal.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.570
I'll kill him! That Sensory-Type Hidden Leaf ninja!

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.370
It's a good thing she didn't use the Hiramekarei on you, sir.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:22.600
Foo.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.100
Well?

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.330
Forgive me, sir. I have failed.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.870
It cannot be helped.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.800
The longer this battle drags on,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.430
the more chakra will be shaved from you and the greater you will weaken.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.700
And I'll grow proportionately stronger.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.830
Bee! You must take his sword away!

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.000
That sword is the key to his strength!

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.530
That's if you can pull it off my body.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.130
He merged with his sword?!

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.500
He's like a fish that became a man.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.370
Or is it a man that's half fish?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.930
That's too much explaining! He's half fish, half man!

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.130
Here I come!

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.930
At this rate, both Master Kin and Ponta will drown.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.930
First, we have to get out of the water!

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.870
You cannot escape this Water Style Jutsu.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.770
I have the advantage in this location right now.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.200
I can't see the boundary! So much water! So crazy!

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.930
Bee! Behind you!

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.400
These circumstances are hunky-dory! I won't be taken down, sorry!

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.770
This isn't the time for your lame rapping!

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.900
The water bubble is in motion

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.230
and that half-fish guy is at the center!

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.670
Pay attention!

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.300
And he's faster under water than we are!

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.970
Plus he's half fish, so he probably breathes through gills!

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.700
Just running away is gonna get us killed.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.400
So what'll we do?

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.100
Akatsuki's target is you, Bee!

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.770
Leave that enka geezer and the raccoon

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.830
and run in a different direction!

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.570
He's definitely gonna come after you.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.200
I see. That way, those two can…

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:42.270
Right! While he's pursuing you, the water will move with him.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.530
Then those two can get out of the water.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.970
All right! Now come this way!

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.400
What?!

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.500
I must capture the Eight-Tails alive,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.800
but there's no rule against killing these two!

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.300
I ain't letting that happen, ya fool!

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.870
Wha—?!

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.670
I got you!

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.900
Suction pads?!

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.400
Gotcha!

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.300
No way will you keep taking my chakra.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.130
Fool, ya fool!

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.030
You really are worthy of being called the perfect Jinchuriki.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.200
To be able to change just one part of yourself into your Tailed Beast is impressive.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.100
All right, they're out.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.670
You seem to be having trouble breathing.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.570
It was a good idea, but as long as you're touching me,

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.470
you'll continue losing chakra.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.570
I can see why Samehada can't contain his excitement.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.970
He has discovered his favorite kind of chakra.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.930
No one in the Akatsuki is as good as I am at taking prey alive.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.300
This Water Prison Shark Dance Jutsu is so much fun

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.400
because I can probe the amount of chakra to shave

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.900
until you're just on the verge of death.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.700
I must admit to failing once in a while.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.770
I guess I have to use Lariat again. I just have to time it right.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.400
Don't!

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.800
You can't beat him underwater!

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.930
That last attempt with the octopus leg put him on guard.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.730
Just make a run for it!

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.100
Use that!

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.330
Ink… A smokescreen.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.470
You are an octopus, after all.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.100
However…

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:11.870
With my body merged with Samehada, I can detect chakra through my skin.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.100
It seems you'll run out of chakra soon.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.430
Bee…

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.270
I'm coming…Bee!

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.100
The Eight-Tails turned out to be rather disappointing too.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.100
I can't chance you squirming around

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.300
and going into a Tailed Beast State again.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.100
So I'm going to cut off your legs as a precaution.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.130
He took most of my chakra too!

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.100
Damn it! Get up, Bee!

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.400
We're in a real bind!

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.070
Though, my blade doesn't cut cleanly!

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.070
What's the matter?

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.630
Don't tell me you've become attached to the Eight-Tails.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:41.300
You like his chakra that much, Samehada?

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.400
That was chakra you took from me!

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.800
Very well. Shall we exchange weapons then?

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.070
This sword…

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.430
It looks like it has a nice, sharp edge!

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:17.900
Now!

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:20.970
A pencil?!

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.770
Too bad.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.470
Definitely too bad.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.430
So that was your plan, eh?

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.370
Sorry we're late, Bee.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.970
Brother…

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.770
Raikage? How did you find us?

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.370
That mass of water you created was quite visible.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.470
And I perceived Bee and the Eight-Tails' chakra mixed inside it.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.970
You really went to town sucking up someone else's chakra

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.530
and using it for yourself.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.030
It was so obvious.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.970
Guess you found us, after all.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.230
That Samehada… It's giving the Eight-Tails more chakra!

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.330
Let's do it.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.370
Okay, Brother.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:24.670
Water Style: Super Shark Bomb—

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.900
— Double Lariat! — Double Lariat!

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.700
I must say, you two are too fast.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:51.930
Brother…

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.200
No!

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.370
Wandering around by yourself!

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:02.570
Even ya non-dominant arm does me a lot o' harm! Sound da alarm!

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.100
This is also a battle to protect you.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:46.300
Naruto… You said you would one day become Hokage.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.830
I became Kazekage.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.970
If you made the decision to shoulder the name of Kage,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.670
then you must do what is necessary as Sasuke's friend.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.970
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "As One's Friend"

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.570
I will protect you with my life.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.830
Tune in again!
