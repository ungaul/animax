00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.430
Papa's Youth

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390
Guy, why did you do such a thing?!

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.090
Papa…

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.840
Papa… How can you stay so positive and optimistic?

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.890
When does one's youth come to an end?

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.800
As long as you never turn your back against youth, it never ends.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.760
Then are you saying your youth won't come to an end when you die, Papa?!

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.760
What are you saying, Guy?!

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.640
That is when youth climaxes!

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.220
When it burns the brightest!

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.970
There's something wrong with you, Papa!

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.140
Youth doesn't matter a bit when you die!

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.090
You can believe in it until you die,

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.550
but there's no guarantee you'll win against someone strong!

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.890
Just like me…

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.010
True victory isn't about winning against someone strong.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.390
It's about defending what's important to you!

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.550
I just wanted…

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.760
to protect this youth that you always talk about!

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.680
THE FOLLOWING HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AS ACADEMY ALTERNATES: FURUSUGI TOSUI HII TOGAKURE

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.430
Deciding someone's future is something one never gets used to.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:23.010
RULE…RUN 500 LAPS… ACADEMY… ACCEPTED AS AN ALTERNATE!

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.470
THE FOLLOWING HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AS ACADEMY ALTERNATES: FURUSUGI TOSUI HII TOGAKURE MIGHT GUY

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.390
– Papa! – Guy!

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.470
Those two are at it again.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.390
Someone should report them soon.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.180
Oh!

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.890
My son's efforts have been rewarded!

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.550
I've been accepted as an alternate!

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.890
– Thank you for your support! – Thank you for your support!

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.800
Clone Jutsu!

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.140
Well, that's a start.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.430
Kakashi Hatake, let's see your clone!

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.010
What's wrong?

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.220
Step up to the front and—!

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.800
Awesome!

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.140
You are Sakumo's son, after all…

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.010
To be able to do a Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.680
Papa… There really are people who can be considered geniuses!

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.010
Next, Might Guy.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.390
Step up to the front.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.680
Y-Yes!

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.180
All right, let's see your Clone Jutsu.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.720
Y-Yes…

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.890
He can't even do ninjutsu…

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.640
Aw man, looks like he's gonna pee in his pants!

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.340
Hurry up and do it!

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.640
All right!

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.260
Clone Jutsu!

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.760
Who wants to wear that?!

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.930
Who'd wear something that ugly!

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.390
As Papa said, I do have something that shines brilliantly!

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.300
Yes… My taijutsu is already shining brilliantly.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.840
That's right. What they say doesn't matter!

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.220
I'm my own self!

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.470
I'll follow Papa, and do my best according to my self-rule!

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.840
If I can't do 500 laps, I'll do 500 handstands!

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.890
If I can't do 500 laps on my hands, I'll do 500 push-ups!

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.220
If I can't do push-ups… I'll do them on my fingers…

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.220
500…

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.140
F-Fifteen…

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.680
He couldn't do any of them!

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.590
He can't even do taijutsu!

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.970
Papa told me… Effort always…always pays off!

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.760
You fool!

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.840
I have no doubt that boy will become your lifelong rival!

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.590
So why don't you challenge him?!

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.970
That's crazy… He's a genius. It's obvious I'd lose…

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.800
And so what if you do?

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.930
I'll go with you, so let's go find this Kakashi boy.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.970
W-Wait! B-But…

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.890
O-Okay, I'll follow my self-rule.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.590
Oh? Your self-rule!

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.840
If I can't do 500 laps around the school,

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.840
I'll challenge Kakashi!

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.090
Well said, Guy! That's more like my son!

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.550
– Thank you for your support! – Thank you for your support!

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.760
496…

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.180
I can't do it…after all…

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.590
Huh? I'm not that exhausted…?

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.800
Huh? I can keep going?

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.140
The 500th lap!

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.890
I did it!

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.840
I don't have to challenge him…

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.430
If I can't do 500 laps…

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.090
I'll challenge…Kakashi…

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.470
498…

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.970
500 laps!

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.930
I did it again!

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.890
500…501…

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.680
502…503…

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.300
504…

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.890
He's making it look easy.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.970
He's totally doing it…

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.300
753…754…

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:34.840
755…756…757…

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.000
I see… So you haven't been able to challenge Kakashi yet.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.210
But you're following your self-rules, so that's that.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:57.540
Yes.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.830
You realize it's because you're doing such a good job

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.460
honing your strong points?

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.040
And now, I'm going to challenge myself

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.500
by going up and down this mountain 500 times!

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.580
That was cold!

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.790
If the genius trains just as hard…

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.830
what chance do I have to beat him?

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.500
But…I just don't want to lose in hard work and perseverance.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.580
Is that boy Kakashi?

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.130
Yes.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.460
I was wrong.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.710
There's nothing wrong with wishing…

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.540
or praying for success… as a self-rule.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.210
That boy intimidates you, doesn't he?

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.500
When I can do 5000 laps around the schoolyard…

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.710
I'll challenge Kakashi!

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.880
Well said, my son!

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.630
Do your best, my son!

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.960
The road of your youth stretches out before you!

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.630
345!

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.710
Go! Run and keep on running!

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.000
500…

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.670
Guy… Keep on going!

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.210
1507…

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.880
The springtime of youth still chases after you!

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.830
2849…

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.750
I want to challenge you!

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.000
I will not lose!

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.380
5000…laps!

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.880
Congratulations, Guy!

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.960
Papa… So this is youth.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.670
So? How about we lay our youth on the line for a hot-blooded battle?

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.880
If it's taijutsu, I won't lose to you!

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.750
It's heavy!

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.750
Leaf Hurricane!

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.920
Here I go!

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.380
Come on!

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.040
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.580
– Again! Again! Again! Again! – Again! Again! Again! Again!

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.500
Guy! Congratulations on graduating from the Academy!

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.670
But you cannot graduate from youth!

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.710
Of course! I don't care if I die as a remnant of youth!

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.170
I will stay forever in the academy we call youth!

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.460
– Thank you for your support! – Thank you for your support!

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.710
Operation Cat Rescue…successful!

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.710
Lord Hokage praised me as the master of finding cats!

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.670
Oh…

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.710
Isn't that wonderful?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.290
But, is this the climax of your youth, Papa?

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.750
Depending on how things go with the Third Great Ninja War,

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.750
there may be changes in team formations.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.330
But for now, I'm your team captain, Choza Akimichi.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.880
Since fate has brought us all together as a team…

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.080
Please forgive me!

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.920
I'll never make this mistake again!

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.880
You say that,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.670
but you keep making the same mistake over and over again.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.040
– I have no choice but to drop you. – Please, not that!

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.710
You keep asking me…

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.920
But I'm tired of hearing that from you.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.040
Please, give me another chance!

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.170
I'll take any mission. I'll work harder than ever before!

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.420
I beg you!

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.790
Please! Please!

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.420
How can he humiliate himself like that?

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.750
That's not youth.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.630
Isn't that how he raised you though?

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.380
I don't think there's a cooler shinobi out there…

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.670
…than your dad.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.540
True victory isn't about winning against someone strong.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.790
It's about defending what's important to you!

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.960
Father…

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.710
Guy, you've grown into a fine young man…

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.670
There's only one thing left that I'm able to do for you.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.750
Now pay close attention, Guy.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.420
Father… What is this?!

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.580
The Eight Inner Gates… A type of Forbidden Jutsu!

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:48.330
Father mastered such a technique? When did he…?

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.710
As a genin, I practiced every day,

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.790
and finally grasped this unique jutsu after twenty years.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.460
Twenty years!

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:02.540
To put it plainly,

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.580
this is the one and only jutsu that I can pass on to you as your father.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.630
And it shall become a most special technique to you!

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.330
Special?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.790
You have become a splendid shinobi!

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.080
But I shall impose one strict condition

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.250
upon the use of this technique.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.920
A self-rule!

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.580
A self-rule…

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.790
Father…

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.380
His chakra is spreading toward the Death Gate's Chakra Point.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.710
Father…

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.460
The Eighth Gate…of Death!

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.580
It's no good… We're surrounded.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.630
There's no way we can escape.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.750
No way…

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.040
Aren't they the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist?!

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.880
So even brats from other villages know who we are?

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.380
We've gotten pretty famous.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.500
What's this? It's slight, but the blade's gotten chipped!

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.920
I have to let it suck some blood…

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.000
…and restore it with iron.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.210
What'll we do? We can't take them on by ourselves!

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.330
I made it just in time!

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.460
Father!

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.750
You're a genin, Father!

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.960
What're doing here?!

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.380
Never mind, just run away!

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:42.920
I'll buy you some time!

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.210
Run away?!
Father!

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.710
They are jonin, plus, they're the Seven Ninja Swordsmen!

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.670
You're no match for them!

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.210
I have the Gate of Death… the Eight Inner Gates Formation!

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.710
But that's—!

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.210
I'm going by my self-rule!

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.250
Now is the time…

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.920
Open! Eight Inner Gates Formation!

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.920
…to protect something precious enough to give your life for!

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.960
Guy, are you really going to—!

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.710
I can't believe this.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.500
Red vapor…

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.460
The unique vapor of blood… from the opening of all eight gates…

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.580
But actually seeing it with my own eyes…

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.210
It's almost like the color of dead autumn leaves

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.960
that have fallen off their tree…

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.630
You're right.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.000
But they're not falling for any reason or purpose…

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.830
They become the nutrients… for fresh green leaves!

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.710
And the period they bridge,

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.630
until the new spring when fresh leaves bud…

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.670
…is the climax of youth! When it burns most crimson!

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.330
Sekizo, Evening Elephant!

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.700
What has Might Guy done?

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.280
The Eight Inner Gates Formation.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.910
A move that allows one to draw out one's maximum power

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.240
by releasing the limiters placed on it.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.830
The release of all Eight Limiters results

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.200
in power tens of times greater than that of the Five Kage.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:53.740
But…

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.620
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Eight Inner Gates Formation"

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.240
You're the first since Hashirama to make me feel this excited!

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.990
