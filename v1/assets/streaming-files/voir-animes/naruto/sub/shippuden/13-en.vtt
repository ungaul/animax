WEBVTT

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.600
Don't tell me you're...

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.300
It appears that you've remembered...

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.330
Have we met before...?

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.000
It looks like the freak beast's intelligence is at the level of a beast too...

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.000
Well... I'll make you remember soon...

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.630
Itachi...

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.200
Ah, so he is that brat... who killed his entire clan.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.870
It's been a while, Mr. Kakashi, Naruto...

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.600
A Sharingan... Just like Sasuke's!

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.930
He is the...one who's tormenting Sasuke and Naruto.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.130
You bastard...

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.030
Not just me, but Gaara too!

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.130
I will destroy you guys!

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.300
Everyone! Don't look directly at his eyes! It's dangerous!

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.030
A Meeting with Destiny 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.830
So this is the Akatsuki!

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.630
Water Style: Exploding Water Shock Wave!

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.500
He's coming!

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.470
Yes!

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.670
Here I go!

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.070
Itachi's Genjutsu is Visual Jutsu.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.700
Therefore, it's a type where one gets caught by his sight,

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.470
so it'll be okay as long as we don't make eye contact with him.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.370
Yeah, I know!

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.170
But then...

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.070
How should we fight him?

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.200
Well...

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.030
Guy, how did you fight with Itachi?

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.330
Huh?

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.730
Well...

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.270
Decipher his actions just by how he moves his body and feet.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.230
That seems pretty hard.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.230
The Uchiha clan, eh?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.670
It's been a while since I went up against a Sharingan.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.570
You don't have to be that surprised.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.270
There are a few fighting techniques to counter this Visual Jutsu.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.370
What should we do?

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.300
"If it's one against one, then you must flee."

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.530
"If it's two against one, then take the back."

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.730
Say what?

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.800
You know what "if it's one against one, then flee" means right?

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.300
There is no way you can win.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.300
But if it's two against one...

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.330
If it's two against one,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.070
even if one is caught by the Genjutsu, the other will take his back and hit him.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.900
Then the Genjutsu will cease.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.100
Even if that is impossible,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.470
if you hit your teammate, then you can end the Genjutsu.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.100
So, if there is more than one of us, then one will distract him.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.400
The rest of us will constantly attack him from the back

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.470
where the Sharingan can't see.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.070
I see.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.730
Amazing, you know a lot from old age!

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.470
Then I'll take his back-- Wait!

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.030
Neji! Lee!

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.630
So...how is it?

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.630
Doesn't it remind you?!

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.930
How can he let out this much water?

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.670
This technique requires a huge amount of Chakra.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.170
Kakashi Sensei, what do you mean by wait?!

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.730
Do you want to say my way of fighting the Sharingan is wrong?

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.770
That would work if it's an ordinary Genjutsu,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.070
but it's a bit more complicated in his case.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.970
What?

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.000
He uses Mangekyo Sharingan

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.100
which is a much stronger Visual Jutsu than an ordinary Sharingan.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.130
If you receive his Visual Jutsu,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.430
then you will experience his Genjutsu in a second.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.430
In other words, even though it may seem like a second to others,

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:14.770
the person who receives the Jutsu will feel it for hours or days.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.500
In my case, I roamed around in his Jutsu for three days,

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.270
and lost consciousness for more than a week.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.230
It's not a matter of ending or not ending the Genjutsu.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:39.900
He's troublesome... Who exactly is this guy?

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.030
Impressive Kakashi.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.070
It seems you didn't suffer my Tsukiyomi, Nightmare Realm, in vain.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.230
That is not all that I know...

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.100
After you used the Visual Jutsu, you were quite exhausted

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.970
and you ended the battle immediately and tried to leave.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.170
But Itachi...

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.070
Even for you, it is dangerous to use that "eye" too much...

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.530
We did not come here to fight.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.100
Unfortunately, anything more than this is nonsense. Let's go.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.830
In addition to using up quite a lot of Chakra,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.530
it seems it comes with some risk to your "eye" as well, Itachi.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.870
From just one match, you have analyzed it quite well.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.800
Hey Itachi.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.800
Your eyesight... How much has it weakened?

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.900
Kakashi... Could it be that you...?

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.100
Where is he?

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.000
Guy Sensei! Tenten!

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.630
A Water Clone!

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.570
You didn't even have time to recall.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.400
It seems like Itachi also has come into contact with the enemy...

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.870
Kisame is in the middle of a fight.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.670
Lee!

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.070
Leaf Rising Wind!

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.200
What?!

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.100
8 Trigrams: Air Palm!

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.930
It's programmed.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.570
Damn! I let him get away!

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.830
Where did he go?

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.370
Neji, where's the enemy's location?

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.100
In front! He's coming up.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.030
I found him!

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.470
Seriously... What troublesome brats.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.530
It's so bothersome.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.630
The Water Style Ninjutsu and that big sword...

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.470
You are...!

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.430
It seems like you have finally remembered.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.930
I do feel like we have met somewhere.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.130
You still can't remember, huh...

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:15.030
You really are good at hurting people's feelings.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.770
Until you recall...

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.200
I will take my time putting you through pain.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:52.770
I underestimated you back then. But I'm not that pathetic.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.370
It's not going to work the way it did before, you see.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:07.630
It's a huge mistake if you think I'm the same as before!

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.530
Naruto, I'll deal with him.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.600
This happened before too.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.370
Form the Manji. You guys look after Tazuna.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.570
Don't get involved in the fight.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.370
Huh?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.130
And work as a team here.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.870
Y-You mean another non-fighting teamwork?

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.130
No. This time, cover me.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.830
To be honest, I want to be cool and say, "Go on ahead," but...

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.230
Against him, even I can't contain him alone.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.030
Let's see...

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.530
It's time for a counterattack. First, I'll get him off guard.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.170
If I succeed, don't hesitate to attack.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.370
- Roger! - Roger!

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.500
Do you think you'll get me off guard that easily?

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.970
I will quickly change your mind.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.230
Gentle Fist!

00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:59.370
I see...

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:04.770
You swing that heavy sword so easily and you don't get caught off guard.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.730
If close battle does not work...

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.570
How's that?

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.270
Did you do something?

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.270
What an annoying sword.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.830
Oh yeah, that sword...!

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.400
Did you recall?

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.000
That's your weapon, huh?

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.570
You can tell by looking.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.970
But there is a big difference between knowing it

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.370
and really  knowing it.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.470
As expected Guy Sensei... Each word holds a deep meaning.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.930
Why now for god's sake? Can you quit being amazed every time?

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.600
Forget it, Tenten.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.370
Let me take back what I said.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.900
It seems like your intelligence is less than an animal.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:06.800
Here we go!

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.900
Dynamic action!

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.730
It's about time for you to come with me...

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.700
Naruto.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.470
I'll go first!

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.030
Shadow Clone?!

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.130
Rasengan!

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.270
This is also a Shadow Clone!

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.670
Sakura! Granny!

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.830
Sakura...?

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:37.900
Now!

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.700
Water Clone Jutsu!

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.630
What?!

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.230
Water Prison Jutsu!

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.000
Damn it!

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.870
Lee! Neji! Tenten!

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.000
Kakashi Sensei!

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.870
What's going on?

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:43.070
Hello kids, thanks for coming to the Kisame aquarium today.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.530
The show you've been waiting for is about to begin.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.270
The five sharks led by this aquarium's fabulous leader

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.970
Shark Boy and Brother Guy.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.970
Before that, here are some warnings.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Those in the front row should watch out for the water splash.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.800
Okay everyone; let's yell as loud as we can.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.870
Okay ready, Shark Boy!

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:06.930
Next time: "Naruto's Growth"
