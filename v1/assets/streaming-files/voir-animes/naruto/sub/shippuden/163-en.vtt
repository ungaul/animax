WEBVTT

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.610
Thank You

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.940
– Run! – Help!

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.820
Iruka, are you all right?

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.110
Mom!

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.860
Dad! Mom's…!

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.320
Why didn't you stay at the shelter?

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.570
I'll take care of Mom, so hurry up and get out of here!

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.730
No, I won't!

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.110
I don't want to leave you and Mom behind and run away!

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.360
I'll protect Mom!

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.440
Don't push your luck, you're still a kid!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.400
It's a parent's duty to protect their children!

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.610
You must avoid damage to the village!

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.530
Chase the Nine Tails outside the village walls!

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.480
Yes sir!

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.530
Buy me time so that I can execute my jutsu!

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.320
Do not slow down the attack!

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.730
Right! Let's go!

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.110
Ninja Art! Summoning!

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.230
Appear… Monkey King Enma!

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.070
The Nine Tails, huh.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.480
So the seal was broken?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.480
We're going to chase it out of the village with the Adamantine Nyoi!

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
Got it! Transform!

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.440
Let's go, Enma!

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.860
Right!

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.610
Extend!

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.230
I've chased it out of the village.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.610
Don't let up! Keep at him!

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.280
Minato… Where are you?!

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.400
I must hand it to the Fourth Hokage.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.400
You wounded me and managed to pull out the Nine Tails.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.150
However, the Nine Tails will be mine eventually.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.030
I am going to rule the world…

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.150
And there are so many ways to go about doing that.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.440
That tone… He's not joking around.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.440
Keep him occupied until the Fourth Hokage arrives!

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.650
Iruka…

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.570
Let go of me!

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.400
My dad and my mom are… still fighting!

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.110
BIND

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.820
Now listen up.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.570
You young shinobi are to stay away from Nine Tails.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.440
What do you mean by that?

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.360
This is not a battle between villages.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.110
This is domestic trouble.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.070
There is no reason for you all to risk your lives.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.030
Speak for yourself!

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.650
Calm down, Kurenai!

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.400
You're a shinobi too.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.900
We are not guaranteed a long life.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.480
But, my daughter…

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.070
At least, pass on the Will of Fire to my grandchild.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.030
Make that your oath to your father.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.530
For I do believe in you.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.780
This is terrible.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.440
He's going to do that again?

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.610
Lord Third!

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.690
Summoning Jutsu!

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.610
This is…

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.400
It's the Fourth Hokage!

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.230
I will rule the world.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.980
Kushina, forgive me.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.980
Hold down the Nine Tails for just a while!

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.480
That's going to be tough… even for me!

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.190
In order to transport something this big,

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.980
I'll need just as much chakra!

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.570
Minato…

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.480
Did he fly off with the Nine Tails?

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.280
That way!

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.150
I must put up a barrier immediately.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.730
My chakra is almost…

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.320
I can still do it, Minato.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.280
Kushina!

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.440
Did I wake you up?

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.610
I'm sorry, Naruto.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.530
Kushina…

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.610
I'm going to draw the Nine Tails with me to my death.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.150
So we can delay the revival of the Nine Tails.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.530
I'll be able to save all of you

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.730
with what little chakra I have left.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.280
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.650
FOURTH HOKAGE Kushina…

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.070
FOURTH HOKAGE It's because of you that I'm the Fourth Hokage!

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.280
You made me a man!

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.360
And you made me this baby's father!

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.320
And yet…

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.980
Minato, don't give me that look!

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.480
I'm happy that you loved me.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.860
And today…is this child's birthday.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:16.360
If I were to imagine me alive, and our future together,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.690
the three of us as a family…

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.400
I can't see us having anything but a happy life.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.530
If I were allowed just one regret,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.400
it's that I won't be able to see Naruto grow up.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.690
How I wish I could have seen that.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:45.730
Kushina, there is no need for you to die with the Nine Tails.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.190
Preserve what little chakra you have left

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.940
for a reunion with Naruto.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.440
I'll seal all of your remaining chakra inside Naruto.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.820
It will be part of an Eight Signed Seal.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.730
Then I'll take the Nine Tails with me

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.730
with the only Sealing Jutsu I can do since I'm not a Jinchuriki,

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.230
the Reaper Death Seal!

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.860
But the caster that uses that jutsu…!

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.820
And one more thing.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.650
I will only seal half of the Nine Tails.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.820
Sealing a power this immense is physically impossible.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.230
It's also strategically unwise.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.110
If you take the Nine Tails and its seal with you when you die,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.480
there won't be a Jinchuriki around when he reemerges.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.820
That will upset the balance of power between the Tailed Beasts.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.610
The Reaper Death Seal will seal half of the Nine Tails with me forever.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.150
As for the other half of the Nine Tails…

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.320
Perhaps you are the Child of Prophecy.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.440
What is it?

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.980
Sometime in the future,

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.530
the Shinobi World will face a grave crisis.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.360
The savior that will emerge during this time

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.230
is the Child of Prophecy.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.860
I will seal it inside Naruto with the Eight Signed Seal!

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.940
I know what you want to say.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.530
But remember what Master Jiraiya said about world upheaval.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.360
And the calamities that would follow.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.110
Two things were confirmed for me today.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.610
That masked man who attacked you today

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.230
is a harbinger of disaster!

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.150
And the one who will stop him is this child!

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.280
This infant whose godfather is Master Jiraiya.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.150
He will open up the future as a Jinchuriki.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.570
I don't know why, but I'm convinced of this.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.030
But Minato…!

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.530
Reaper Death Seal!

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.530
Let's put our trust in this child!

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.690
He's our son, after all!

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.440
Those signs. Don't tell me…!

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.230
Yes, it's the Reaper Death Seal.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.530
When I'm finished with the Reaper Death Seal,

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.400
I will seal your chakra inside Naruto.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.650
When he tries to control the Nine Tail's power as a Jinchuriki,

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.980
I want you to help him out.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.690
Our son…

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.230
He's our son,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.320
which is why I don't want to put such a terrible burden on him!

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.280
And also, why use the Reaper Death Seal?

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.440
If it's just so I can meet a grown-up Naruto

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.730
even if it's just for a short while,

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.530
there's no need for you to die!

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.610
I want you to stay by Naruto as he grows up and protect him.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.860
I don't get it!

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.280
To keep the balance of Tailed Beasts?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.530
For the sake of the nation and the village?

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.110
Why must Naruto be sacrificed?!

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.940
Why must you sacrifice yourself for me?!

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.690
To forsake one's nation, and one's village,

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.570
is the same as forsaking one's child.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.570
Your own homeland was destroyed, so you of all people should know…

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.070
the harsh life that awaits those without a country.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.030
Besides, our family is…

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.400
shinobi!

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.570
And finally, even if I were to live, I'm no match to you.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.530
Even though you won't have much time with him,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.690
there are some things only you as his mother can tell Naruto.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.900
Things that I can't.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.650
That's a mother's role.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.610
I'm not doing this just for you. I'm doing this for Naruto.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.530
I will gladly die for my son.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.780
It's my duty as his father.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.690
Lord Third, what's wrong?!

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.400
It's no good.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.530
I can't go further than this point

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.400
because of the barrier put up to keep Nine Tails from escaping!

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.530
Those two are planning to take care of Nine Tails themselves!

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.820
Damn you, Fourth Hokage!

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:48.820
Seal!

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.940
My body is getting numb…

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.030
I never expected such massive chakra…

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.400
Damn you!

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.320
It's the Reaper Death Seal, after all.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.110
He actually used it.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.110
But the Nine Tails is still…!

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.940
Wasn't he able to complete the seal?

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.650
It's gotten smaller, but…

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.440
All right, next is the Eight Signed Seal.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.400
I will seal the Nine Tails inside Naruto.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.440
The Ritual Altar?

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.070
Does he intend to seal me again?

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.980
Furthermore… Inside that baby?

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.400
Kushina! Are you all right?

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.650
Right now!

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.980
I said that this was the father's duty.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.860
Then all the more, since I'm his mother!

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.230
There's a child?

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.400
They shielded him.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.440
Why you—!

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.730
This is the first time I lost an argument.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.190
Okay, I understand that you're determined to do this.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.900
Thank you, Kushina.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.070
Summoning Jutsu!

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.400
Nine Tails!

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.570
What?! Lord Fourth too! What's the meaning of this?!

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.940
Gerotora, I'm going to give you the Sealing Formula's key.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.940
Take it immediately to Master Jiraiya and store it away.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.400
I see… Minato plans to make his own son the Jinchuriki

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.320
to save the village.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.360
You have my world. I confirm the key is in my possession.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.690
And now, I'm off!

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.360
That should do it.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.530
Kushina, my time is running out.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.570
I'm going start the Eight Signed Seal.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.610
I want to put some of my chakra in Naruto too.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.610
It'll be quite a while before we can see him.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.820
Let's tell him what we want to say.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.440
Naruto…

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.030
Don't be picky. Eat lots and grow strong.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.320
Make sure you bathe every day and stay warm.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.940
Also don't stay up late. You need lots of sleep.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.360
And make friends.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.360
You don't need a lot of friends.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.400
Just a few… Ones you can really, really trust.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:15.150
I wasn't very good at it,

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.570
but keep up with your studies and practice your ninjutsu hard.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.650
Remember that everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.150
So don't get too depressed if you can't do something well.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.980
Respect your teachers and upperclassmen at the Academy.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.320
Oh, and this is important.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.110
It's about the Three Prohibitions for a shinobi.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.440
Be extra careful about lending and borrowing money.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.530
Put your mission wages into your savings account.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.480
No alcohol until you're twenty.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.610
Too much can ruin your health, so drink in moderation.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.940
Another Prohibition is women.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.570
I'm a woman, so I don't know too much about this but…

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.400
All you need to remember is that

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.480
this world is made up of men and women.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.650
So it's only natural to take an interest in girls…

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.480
But just don't get hooked on bad women.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.820
Find someone just like me.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:26.780
Speaking of the Three Prohibitions, be wary of Jiraiya Sensei, you know.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.030
Naruto, from now on,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.030
you're going to face lots of pain and hardship.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.780
Be true to yourself.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.190
Have a dream and

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:47.400
have the confidence to make that dream come true!

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.570
There's so much…

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:57.570
Oh, so much more that I want to pass on to you.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.570
I wish I could stay with you longer.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.570
I love you.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.400
Minato, I'm sorry I used up your time.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.440
Oh, it's okay.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.400
Naruto, my message to you is…

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.980
I guess it's the same as your nagging mother's.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:22.570
Eight Signed Seal.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:39.190
I'm sorry for making you the Nine Tail's vessel.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.900
For putting our burden on your shoulders…

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.190
For not being able to live by your side…

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.980
For not being able to shower you with love.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.320
You don't have to apologize.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.610
It was rough in the past because I was a Jinchuriki.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.860
But I never held it against you or Dad.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:07.530
I admit I didn't really know what parental love was.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.530
After all, you and Dad weren't around.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.530
I just had a feeling.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:20.530
But I know now that you and Dad gave your lives just for me.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.530
And I realize that even more than the Nine Tails,

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.570
my vessel is filled with your love!

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.570
I'm happy!

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.480
I'm glad I'm your son, Mom and Dad!

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.650
Minato, are you listening?

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.480
Our hopes did reach our boy!

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:43.110
Naruto… Thank you for letting me be your mom.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.030
And thank you for letting Minato be your dad.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:54.440
Thank you for being born to us!

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.860
Thank you…

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.530
so very much.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:41.110
Naruto faced and defeated his true self here.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.820
Guy, why don't you try it out for yourself!

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:43.940
Don't be stupid!

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.780
I came here to help Naruto!

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.070
Are you afraid to face your true self?

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.150
What did you say?

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.360
Okay then, I'll try it out!

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.320
I have a feeling your true self isn't human!

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.900
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Battle in Paradise! Odd Beast vs. The Monster!"

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.360
Is that my true self?

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.570
Tune in again!
