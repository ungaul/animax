WEBVTT

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.300
They haven't been here yet.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.770
Not yet, huh?

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.800
We'll monitor the area here until there's movement!

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.270
I-I don't know... No way would I tell you even if I did.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.500
That's what he says. Should we kill him?

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.830
We should leave the torture to Ibiki.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.300
No signs of the Akatsuki, after all.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.830
Same here.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.900
It doesn't look like anyone's been through here for several days...

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.230
I think it's certain they haven't been here yet.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.500
What's the plan, Aoba?

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.400
There are still no requests for backup

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.130
from the units that went to the other four Collection Offices.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.170
Which means there's still been no contact with the Akatsuki, huh?

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.830
Well, I don't know about that.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.130
They might already be in the middle of a fight right now.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.370
Don't worry.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.970
It'd be reassuring if Asuma's unit

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.170
were to make contact with the Akatsuki.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.330
You guys know of his strength better than anyone, right?

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.200
That's right.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.630
Yeah, and Shikamaru's with him, too.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.770
All right! Let's head out and work out another strategy.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.470
Let's go!

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.400
Let's sort out all the information we have right now.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.570
The Akatsuki have headed for one of the five Collection Offices.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.600
There have been no requests for backup from the other four.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.930
And they haven't been to this Collection Office, yet.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.600
That means...

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.530
Right.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.400
There's a chance

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.500
they might still be heading for this Collection Office.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.370
That's about the size of it. We'll lie in wait and grab them.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.200
These are all the possible patterns of action for the enemy at this stage.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.570
All of you take up positions and wait as devised earlier!

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.870
Yes, sir!

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.970
Where'd the Akatsuki go?

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.170
Climbing Silver

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.170
Took you long enough, Kakuzu!

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.870
Too slow.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.370
We got one to start.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.630
That hurts... What's with you jerks?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.700
What's the meaning of this? We pierced his vital spots.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.600
Don't push it in deeper like that!

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.230
Hey, that hurts!

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.400
Is this guy...immortal?

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.400
Isn't it obvious? So...who're you guys?

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.130
That mark.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.200
If I remember correctly, it's from the Guardian Shinobi or something...

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.600
Are you kidding me?

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.730
Do I have to go back inside that smelly Collection Office again?

00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.900
Chiriku...

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.370
We're Hidden Leaf Shinobi.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.970
We've been ordered to either capture or eliminate you Akatsuki.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.330
Akatsuki operate in teams of two.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.970
Our intention was to take down one of you first

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.930
and then capture the other.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.070
But you're pretty tough, as was expected.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.200
So this is the Akatsuki, huh? What insane ability.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.470
My Shadow Sewing probably won't...

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.370
You jerks went after us in the wrong order.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.230
Where's the other one?

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.870
The Jutsu's broken!

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.830
Kotetsu, Izumo, get back!

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.600
Sure enough, the guy in the middle...

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.770
This is a first, you being interested in money, Hidan.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.100
Kakuzu...

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.170
You stay out of this.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.030
I'm going to use these guys for my ritual.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.170
I'll give you the money.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.570
Kakuzu...and Hidan, huh?

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.170
Very well... But don't get careless. You'll die.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.830
I told you. Don't give me that.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.400
If they could kill me, I'd want them to.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.670
Well... I guess it's impossible, huh?!

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.230
What's he going to do with that diagram?

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.130
I'll charge him.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.330
Shikamaru, exploit an opening

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.530
and restrain the immortal guy with your Shadow Sewing.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.130
It doesn't have to be for long.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.670
I'll cut his head off immediately and stop his movements.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.670
That's too risky. This isn't like you.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.270
I should go with you.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.900
Don't you get it?!

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.070
That's the best thing we can do right now!

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.870
I've never seen Asuma look like this before.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.430
These guys are way stronger than me.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.030
Izumo, Kotetsu, you guys back up Shikamaru

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.770
while keeping an eye on the other Akatsuki guy.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.830
If we know what they're capable of, then all the more reason

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.530
we should pull out for now and plan a strategy.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.930
They won't let us get away that easily.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.400
If we try to escape without putting up a fight,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.970
we'll be completely wiped out...

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.970
If that happens, the Hidden Leaf

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.200
will be in even greater danger.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.370
It's like sending in an advance unit to break through enemy lines.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.530
Sometimes you have to be able to make a move like that.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.870
I thought you didn't like moves like that. Just like me...

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.270
Sacrifice is required in order to protect the king

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.330
when your opponent is extremely skilled.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.770
Don't tell me he's going to sacrifice himself.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.500
One of them has great physical strength with unknown abilities.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.830
One of them is immortal.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.900
Indeed, we don't stand much of a chance.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.670
Even so, I can't believe Asuma would use himself as a sacrificial piece.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.270
Shogi? What a pain...

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.230
I know you're lazy.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.830
And I also know that you're good at

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.630
planning strategies for avoiding trouble.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.630
In Shogi, you can create a variety of situations

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.530
by utilizing the individual characteristics of the various pieces.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.800
It's the perfect game for a person like you

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.970
who's good at coming up with strategies.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:32.730
You should be able to figure out

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.030
most of the rules if you read this book.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:36.700
The rest you'll pick up as you play.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:41.030
It's a pain, but I should have it down in ten minutes.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.930
I-I lost...

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.870
You don't have to go easy on me... Seriously.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.330
But I can't believe you'd go with the Climbing Silver.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.730
It was in this book.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.530
It said to use an advance unit to break through enemy lines.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.930
Are you that upset you lost?

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.730
No. Using advance units as sacrificial pieces

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.500
to break through enemy lines, huh?

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.730
It seems like the rational kind of idea you would come up with...

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.900
But I don't really like it.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.130
It's just a game.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.200
I guess. But the Climbing Silver piece,

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.670
while inflicting a lot of damage and undermining the enemy line,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.070
ends up becoming a sacrificial piece.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.200
Certainly taking each other's pieces is a natural part of the game.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.930
But to consider throwing away your pieces to be by-the-book...

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.170
I guess I'm not quite satisfied with that.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.900
I'm not as rational as you say I am.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.330
Shall we play again?

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.400
This time I'll take it nice and slow,

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.270
and I won't use the Climbing Silver.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.270
Breaking through enemy lines...

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.630
Which means these enemies are so powerful,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.270
he thinks using sacrificial pieces is inevitable, huh?

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.970
Indeed, we Chunin would not be pieces

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.800
that could put pressure on these guys.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.670
Furthermore, Asuma would be at an overwhelming disadvantage

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.970
if he had to fight while protecting us.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.400
We could very well be completely wiped out as Asuma said.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.930
What's the best move?

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.300
They are major pieces, no doubt about it.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.100
Bait is necessary to capture a major piece.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.730
We need bait that's big enough to make them think

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.170
it's an unavoidable price to pay for the capture of a major piece.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.370
We're not good enough... to be bait.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.700
If we have to fight with the pieces we have available to us now...

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.030
The Climbing Silver doesn't suit you.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.500
I won't be a mere sacrificial piece. I've got you with me, after all.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.470
How pathetic...

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.300
I can't be the bait and I can't put pressure on the enemy.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.630
But I'll divert the major pieces like crazy.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.330
Are you done with your little strategy session?

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.770
Getting cut up like that hurts like heck, you jerks.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.900
Divine justice will be handed down to you jerks

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.230
who know nothing of the pain of others.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.280
You've got a nice weapon there!

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.650
Asuma!

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.450
Damn it! Reach!

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.780
I'm finished if I get hit by that.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.550
I'll break you over and over again.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.880
Shikamaru... That's fine.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.750
He has to fight while watching out for your Shadow Sewing.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.520
I have the advantage.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.720
Damn it!

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.420
Indeed, my Shadow Sewing attack is creating

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.820
an advantageous battle for Asuma.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.650
Essentially, we're not mistaken...

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.950
But there's no point to having an advantage in this fight.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.350
He's immortal,

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.680
and we have a limit to our Chakra and our lives.

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.680
The real battle won't begin until I grab him.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.380
I don't have the time to think now.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.020
I don't think so!

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:22.620
Oh no!

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.020
That stance!

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.420
How's Chiriku's Jutsu?

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.280
Naturally, Chiriku's is much more impressive than mine, though.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.780
Damn it!

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.420
Hidan! Don't underestimate them.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.980
Keep quiet!

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.120
Just shut up and watch, Kakuzu.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.880
Nice!

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.520
As one would expect, the two of them are in synch.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.320
It appears he really is going to stay out of this.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.080
Even so, we can't trust him to do that.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.550
You almost got him just now, Shikamaru.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.520
More importantly...

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.080
Could you back me up?

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.550
You guys are too desperate.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.380
Atheists always try to escape death with the most efficient approach.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.120
It's totally obvious!

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.050
You play around too much when you fight.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.480
Now!

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.680
This time you've got nowhere to run.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.620
Then I won't dodge!

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.720
Immortal jerk!

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.450
I guess I'll take care of the small fries first.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.220
Oh no!

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.950
I'm your opponent!

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:14.520
Captain Asuma!

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.750
If combo and pinpoint attacks won't hit...

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.880
Burning Ash!

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.650
He stopped his movements?

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.670
What's happening?

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.200
He's the one who was nailed by the Jutsu?

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.130
Why's the captain...?!

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.030
Don't tell me...this is...!

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.000
Hey, did you figure something out, Shikamaru?

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.200
I don't know what kind of approach he used.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.400
But his and Asuma's body might be connected

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.170
with some kind of mechanism.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:56.130
Say what?!

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.130
Connected? What does that mean?!

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.000
Next time: "The Judgment"
