WEBVTT

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.440
It was like a dream...

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.320
The Uchiha and the Senju formed an alliance.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.020
There would no longer be any casualties,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.570
nor would any more children have to die.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.980
And so, we began building our village.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.360
Later, we would ally with the Land of Fire,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.360
and the creation of a peaceful state

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.070
where nation and village stood on equal footing also commenced.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.700
In any case, it was like a dream.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.370
My True Dream

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.460
SHINOBI ACADEMY

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.790
Do you remember how we used to talk here when we were kids?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.790
Yeah...

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.250
Let's build our settlement here!

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.000
Huh?

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.170
And make it so kids won't have to kill each other!

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.830
We'll create a school where kids can train and grow up stronger!

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.080
Assign missions that fit an individual's abilities and strengths!

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.250
Have superiors who can properly assign ranks to commissions!

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.420
It will be a place

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.000
where kids don't have to be sent into harsh battlefronts.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.210
You're pretty much the only one spouting such nonsense.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.250
Well then, what about you?

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.920
It doesn't sound bad at all.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.710
Then it's decided!

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.210
Yeah... If that settlement gets built here,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.250
then I could watch over my little brother,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.790
and protect him in this place where you can see to no end!

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.210
I thought we were just talking about our dream.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.080
They say where there's a will, there's a way...

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.500
And yet, I...

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.710
That dream is now becoming reality.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.250
The leader of shinobi who protects the Land of Fire from the shadows.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.170
The Fire Shadow, or Hokage. Well?

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.370
What's that supposed to be?

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.370
The Land of Fire requests that we select someone

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.080
who will represent the Village.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.710
I'm considering naming you to be our leader... the Hokage.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.290
You no longer have any siblings left...

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.290
But I'd like you to think of all of the village shinobi as your siblings.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.710
I want you to protect them with all your might.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.870
Even though I couldn't protect my own Uchiha brethren?

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.370
Kawarama...

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.250
Itama!

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.420
Itama!

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.870
W-What happened?

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.080
My little brother...died.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.170
I come to the river because I feel like

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.710
all the haziness in my heart gets washed away as I stare at the water.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.250
So that's what happened...

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.960
Your name's Madara, right?

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.750
I wonder if you're like me...

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.830
Do you have siblings?

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.580
I'm one of five.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.960
Well, there used to be five of us.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.080
So...you don't have any more siblings?

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.000
No... I have one younger brother left.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.960
And I'll protect him, no matter what!

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.500
What about you?

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.420
I have one brother left too.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.000
And I intend to protect him too, no matter what.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.000
Flying Raijin Slice!

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.250
Izuna!

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.670
There's no time to get weak right now!

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.370
In addition to the Uchiha and Senju,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.080
it seems the Sarutobi and the Shimura Clans also want to join.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.000
Are you kidding? Are you serious?!

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.830
And there are many others!

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.250
This village is going to keep on expanding!

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.210
We're going to need to come up with a name for the village too...

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.330
Any thoughts?

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.040
How about... The Village...Hidden in the Leaves?

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.920
It's too simple... It's not imaginative.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.330
You called it exactly as you saw it.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.500
How's it different from "Hokage"?!

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.960
And you still have that habit of getting depressed easily!

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.710
It took a long time, but it felt like

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.210
we were back to being the friends we once were.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.750
So you're saying the role of the Hokage

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.120
is to stay in the village and protect everyone?

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.250
There's that... But he'll be even more significant.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.370
As village-building picks up speed, the Hokage will get busier too.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.710
That's why I want to have your likeness

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.040
carved into this cliff at our feet.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.460
As a symbol of our village's protector!

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.120
You've got to be kidding!

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.790
Although...your face is a bit too stern...

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.120
so it will have to be softened here and there.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.170
Well, it beats that sad mug of yours!

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.460
Is it that sad?

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.170
Yeah... It's beyond sad.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.870
Is that so?

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.920
There you are!

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.460
What are you dawdling here for?

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.290
The Feudal Lords from the Land of Fire will be here soon for the conference!

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.540
It's Tobirama...

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.250
For Hokage?!

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.830
That's not your choice!

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.370
To propose Madara as a candidate for leader is fine...

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.960
But the final decision will be made with the top officials,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.460
after consulting with the Land of Fire and the people of the village!

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.580
Things are different from Father's era!

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.250
But...

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.000
Besides, Madara Uchiha being chosen as the leader won't happen.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.960
Everyone knows...

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.170
You are the one who founded this settlement, Big Brother.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.750
Even those from the Uchiha say as much.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.170
Furthermore, haven't you heard the rumors about them?

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.000
The stronger their hate,

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.790
the stronger their Visual Prowess manifests itself.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.540
The Sharingan is such a power.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.960
They're unpredictable.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.080
For the future of the village...

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.040
Stop talking like that, Tobirama!

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.250
I just felt someone's presence.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.500
Tobirama, you would know.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.920
No... I'm not infusing chakra right now.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.040
Don't change the subject, Big Brother!

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.080
From now on, things will be run democratically.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.790
Any objections?

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.080
No... That's fine.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.080
And so... I became the First Hokage.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.620
I became the First Hokage...

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.660
From the Era of Warring States...

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.660
where shinobi clans fought and killed each other...

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:22.280
the Uchiha and Senju joined together to create the ideal shinobi village...

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.070
A shinobi village born from the hope for peace...

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.200
That is the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.530
And I became its First Hokage.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.360
This is the stone tablet that has been passed down the Uchiha for generations.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.740
It's never been shown to an outsider before.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.950
The special text requires Visual Prowess to decipher.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.200
This is what I'm able to decipher so far...

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.360
"One god seeking stability split into light and shadow.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.700
"And it is these opposites together that give rise

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.490
"to all things in this universe."

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.530
This is a universal truth.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.530
In short, it states that true happiness can be found

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.280
when two contrary powers cooperate together.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.860
However, it could be interpreted differently.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.410
Hashirama...

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.280
Do you think I don't know what's going on?

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.240
Leave Tobirama to me. I can't do this without you.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.990
Help me as the Hokage's right hand... and as a brother!

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.570
The people will eventually recognize your merits!

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.910
And then, I'll name you Second Hokage.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.030
After you, I suspect Tobirama will probably become the Hokage.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.820
When he does, the Uchiha will be eventually eliminated.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.700
Knowing this,

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.950
I've reached out to other Uchiha about leaving the village.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.160
But it seems no one is willing to follow me.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.240
Madara...

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.280
I couldn't protect my younger brother...

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.030
And it seems I won't be able to keep the promise I made him...

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.450
that I would protect the clan.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.610
I'm not even trusted by the clan I want to protect.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.280
That's not true!

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.570
Everyone is...

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.990
Perhaps that time, the ultimatum I should have given you was

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.910
"to kill your younger brother."

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.530
You call me your brother.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.700
But which of us would you kill for the sake of the village?

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.530
I'd like to think that I know you pretty well.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.570
I've had enough.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.740
I'm going to leave the village.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.490
I've found a different path to take.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.410
It became clear to me because we showed each other our guts...

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.780
Cooperation is merely a quiet form of conflict.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:52.570
You're wrong!

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.450
I won't let it be like that.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.660
Hashirama, it's what you make of reality.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.700
Let's stop being slaves to it.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.240
It's healthier to view this world as merely a sideshow...

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.910
Have you been listening to me, Madara?!

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.280
You are the only one who's an even match for me.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:17.320
I'm looking forward to the battles we'll fight...

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.030
up until the time I achieve my true dream.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.990
What is your true dream?

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.910
I thought everything we've aimed for is here in this village!

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.490
You just can't see it...

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.030
What's beyond this... The dreams of the far future.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.990
Then tell me about your dreams of the far future.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.320
If it's connected to this village's dreams,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.490
I need your strength as a leader, as a senior member.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.530
And...as a friend.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.360
There is no connection.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.490
And you'll never reach it.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.860
Chasing after me is useless.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.320
You, of all people, should know.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.740
No one is capable of catching me from behind.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.570
Upon saying those words, Madara left the village.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.700
We had come this far together.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.320
And now, Madara was gone from the village we had created together.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.820
But in the world,

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:56.030
everyone respected and copied our village system of Allied Ninja Clans

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.110
which had been created

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.860
by the former warring rivals, the Uchiha and Senju, joining forces.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.030
Villages like the Village Hidden in the Leaves

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.530
which began in the Land of Fire, and its one leader system,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.280
LAND OF FIRE spread like wildfire across the Great Nations.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.660
In the Land of Lightning,

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.320
LAND OF LIGHTNING Hidden Cloud Village was formed with its leader named Raikage.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:20.200
In the Land of Earth,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.700
LAND OF EARTH Hidden Stone Village was formed with its leader named Tsuchikage.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.950
LAND OF WATER The Land of Water had the Hidden Mist with their Mizukage.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.660
And in the Land of Wind,

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.570
LAND OF WIND the Hidden Sand was formed and they named their leader, Kazekage.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.820
Not only the Great Nations,

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.860
but even the smaller nations adopted this system.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.950
Madara's and my dream had come true.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:54.660
Shinobi children learned and played instead of battling.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.410
And they started living long enough to even know the taste of alcohol.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:05.110
But, as if he wanted to destroy his previous dream...

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.860
Madara came back to attack the Leaf Village.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.360
Will you destroy everything that we've accomplished until now, Madara?

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.200
Nothing will come of us battling each other.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.820
This fight will only... hurt the village and shinobi!

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.740
It is disrespect toward our siblings and our comrades!

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.570
You know nothing...

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.030
I don't want to kill you!

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.320
Are you implying that you could kill me at any moment?

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.950
No! I'm saying we are friends...

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.200
I've already...reached it!

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.410
Then so be it!

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:47.950
Sage Art!

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.740
Wood Style...

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.070
Shinsu Senju Veritable 1000-Armed Kan'on!

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.070
Here I come, Madara!

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.660
Come, Hashirama!

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.360
Chojo Kebutsu! Artifacts of the Buddha!

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.570
He stripped off the Susano'o!

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.820
Here I come!

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.610
10th Edict on Enlightenment!

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.410
Madara!

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.910
Hashirama!

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.790
I am the shinobi who created these circumstances.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.710
And I believe that shinobi are those who endure for a purpose.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.110
Those who endure...

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.100
Now, Sasuke... What will you do?

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.480
Will you crush the village? Or...?

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:01.030
