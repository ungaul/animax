WEBVTT

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.070
There you go.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.630
Where'd this one come from so early in the morning?

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.430
Th-This is Takamaru, the fastest messenger in all the Hidden Sand!

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.030
Break!

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.070
What's this...?!

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.470
It's a level-one emergency message!

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.370
Contact the Cipher Corps immediately!

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.970
It's sure been a long time since I've been on a mission...

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.530
I'm so excited!

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.430
Naruto, accept the mission without complaint,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.430
no matter what we're ordered to do.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.500
I know!

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.170
I hope so...

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.030
Move it, move it!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
What was that?

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.830
Watch it, you! Be more careful!

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.200
So the Cipher Corps was summoned, huh...?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.600
Then what the bird from earlier brought must've been...

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.630
You said there's a level-one emergency message?

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.230
Are you sure?

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.930
Yes. It's right here...

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.200
It's from the Sand, huh...?

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.930
Break!

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.430
That message coming here means...

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.430
No doubt something's happened in the Sand!

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.430
Okay!

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.300
I'll get right to deciphering it!

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.030
Team Kakashi, Deployed 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.970
Who'd have thought you could keep up with Crow's speed...

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.100
It looked like the fly was about to land, you see.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.000
I remember now.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.230
This Jinchuriki guy had some siblings.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.200
And I heard that one of them uses Puppets...

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.330
This is probably that guy...

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.000
I think his name was Kantaro... I mean, Kanpachi, or something...?

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.530
It's Kankuro!

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.100
I'm telling you I'm  your opponent.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.400
And you quit gawking and get out of here.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.500
You're in the way.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.870
You're right... I'll be going, then.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.070
Hey, hold it!

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.130
Don't make me repeat myself...

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.670
I'm  your opponent...

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.330
It looks like I'll have to take care of this guy

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.870
and then go after the other one...

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.600
You're sure unlucky...

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.430
My man Sasori just might be the worst possible opponent for you.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.630
There might still be some traps remaining...

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.170
Be careful...

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.830
Preparations for mobilization of the tracking unit have been completed.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.630
All right, go after Kankuro immediately.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.270
Even if you find the enemy, avoid battle as best you can.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.730
Our only goal is to find the enemy hideout.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.500
- Yes, sir! - Yes,sir!

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.600
We'll send out the Kazekage rescue team as soon as we find their hideout.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.800
You'd better come back with some information!

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.700
Get going!
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.400
Kankuro... Make sure you don't do anything reckless...

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.200
I'll show you my Puppet Show!

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.270
There! There!

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.470
You're pretty good... However...

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.400
You didn't notice that the Black Ant was gone, did you?

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.170
Here goes!

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.200
Puppet Show!

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.300
Puppet Show Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.500
The show's over.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.530
Whaaat?!

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.300
A guard for gold bullion transport convoy?!

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.100
Huh? You got a problem?!

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.200
That's totally a C-rank mission!

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.970
I'll just have to say no thanks to a mission like that...

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.600
And here I just told him not to complain.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.400
Please don't act so selfish...

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.530
I'm the one she's going to get mad at...

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.470
I knew he'd react like this... Good grief...

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.800
Ohh, just as you thought...

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.030
Naruto, you haven't matured mentally at all, have you...?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.330
Naruto...

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.330
I gave you an easier mission since this is more or less a comeback for you...

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.770
I didn't ask for this!

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.270
I-I'm sorry, Master! I'll give him a good scolding later...

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.400
Y-You moron! You can talk like that

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.470
because you don't know how frightening she can be... Cha!

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.530
The details of the mission are written here.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.530
Right!

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.070
Geez, man...

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.330
The old man Third Hokage was much more understanding ...

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.430
Huh? Did you say something?!

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.500
Hey! Knock it off!

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.370
Th-There's trouble...Fifth Hokage!

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.830
What's all the commotion...?

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.470
We just received an emergency message from the Sand...

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.900
The Sand...?!

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.270
Did you say an emergency message?!

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.200
This is what we have deciphered...

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.030
What?!

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.470
Sand?!

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.800
A sand clone...?

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.300
Oh...my god...

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.970
It can't be...

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.000
Hey... What happened...?

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.770
The Kazekage of the Hidden Sand has been taken

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.330
by members of the organization called the Akatsuki.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.100
Gaara...

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.000
Those guys again, huh...?

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.130
We have more information concerning the Akatsuki.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.600
And so the Hidden Sand has officially requested our help...

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.170
Lady Tsunade, don't tell me you're going to have Team Kakashi...?!

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.500
This is a time of emergency.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.570
I can't be wasting time on personnel selection.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.430
And besides, we've got someone here

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.970
who's actually fought against the Akatsuki...

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.600
I understand that, but...

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.730
I will now issue Team Kakashi a new mission.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.330
Go to the Village Hidden in the Sand immediately,

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.970
find out what's going on and report back to the Leaf...

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.270
After that, you will follow the orders of the Hidden Sand

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.730
and provide them with back-up!

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.570
How...?

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.330
How...?!

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.070
How can he read my movements like this...?

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.200
And on top of that, he's hardly moved at all the whole time...

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.230
What's the matter? Are you already finished...?

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.600
Like hell I am!

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.600
Poisoned Mist Inferno... Consecutive Needle Combo!

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.970
Are you finished?

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.700
No way... How is he not affected by being in the Poisoned Mist?!

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.670
Making people wait any longer than this goes against my policy...

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.400
I think it's just about my turn now!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.400
Salamander has an iron wall defense...

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.630
It can withstand a direct hit from a few thousand tons of rocks...

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.000
You won't be able to inflict even a scratch on me.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.830
It's safe to say the defensive strength of that puppet

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.400
is indeed of the highest level.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.900
However... There's always a weakness.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.170
It's futile!

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.230
N-No way...

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.830
He figured out Salamander's weakness in one glance...?

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.800
No matter how strong the puppet may be,

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:30.000
the movable parts of the joints are weaker than the other parts.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.500
Now then, shall we go for the finale?

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.000
I usually don't believe in stuff like this, but...

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.400
I've kind of got a bad feeling about this...

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.270
How...?

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.630
How can he read my hidden weapon attack schemes...?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.100
You've got solid talent...

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.770
However, you picked the wrong opponent.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:34.500
Your puppets with the hidden poison weapons...

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.030
I can see through them all...

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.670
Crow! Black Ant! Salamander!

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.400
This is the first time

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.330
my hidden weapon attacks have been read like this...

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.200
You look puzzled...

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.400
You're wondering how I figured out your attacks, huh?

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.100
Of course I did.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.300
Crow...

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.300
Black Ant... Salamander...

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:11.630
The one who created these three puppets is none other...than me!

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.900
That scroll...?!

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.170
You idiot! Hurry up and show it to me!

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.770
What...?

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.500
The Kazekage of the Hidden Sand has been...

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.770
Looks like this isn't the time to be sleeping like this!

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.970
I ended up making someone wait a bit...

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.600
But I never thought my opponent would be

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.600
one of my adorable juniors using hand-me-downs.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.270
I haven't had such a fun fight in quite some time.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:38.070
Then, you're...the celebrated master craftsman of the puppet unit,

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.070
Sasori of the Red Sand?!

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.770
I'm honored that a kid like you knows my name.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.170
You left the Sand over twenty years ago.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.370
What're you doing here?!

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.230
What's the point of asking such a thing before you die?

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:17.100
My body's getting numb... Don't tell me he also uses poison...

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.430
But when?

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.470
I know! At that moment!

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.430
The poison's circulating, huh...? You're finished!

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:53.100
You're just going to suffer. But if you want to live that badly...

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.800
I won't finish you off!

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:01.170
However, that poison will kill you in less than three days.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.370
Gaara...

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.670
Damn it...!

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.500
There he is! He's over there!

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.170
He's collapsed! And his puppets are smashed...

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.730
Okay, we're off now!

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.030
We'll be back, Master.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:36.600
Right...

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.870
Naruto, good luck!

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.370
Thanks.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.270
Hey!

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.400
Are you off on a mission now, Naruto?

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.470
That's right!

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.400
Oh, more importantly.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.570
Tsunade, I've got some information for you.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.170
- The Kazekage of the Hidden Sand... - I know.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.100
I'm just about to send them off to the Sand now.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.270
Right, right.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.170
You know about the Akatsuki and Naruto, don't you...?

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.730
It's an emergency situation you see...

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.030
I just made the best choice I could.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.270
Oh, come on...

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.300
Naruto, come here for a second.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:28.170
Hm?

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:35.930
Listen up, Naruto. Don't get reckless against the Akatsuki.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.070
They've got business with me.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.800
So this time I'll go to them!

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.100
You have indeed gotten stronger...

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.070
But if you don't keep cool, you'll just be asking for trouble.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.830
Losing your cool right away is a bad habit of yours.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.830
Naruto... I think you know...

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.100
But don't use that power.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.570
I know...

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.000
Kakashi...

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.100
Keep an eye on Naruto and make sure he doesn't do anything too reckless.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.000
I'm counting on you. Okay?

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:24.500
Okay.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.100
Kakashi Sensei, Sakura, let's get a move on!

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.030
H-Hey, wait up!

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.530
We're off.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.600
Oh boy...

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.370
Are you worried?

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.700
No, I'm not...

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:49.770
He's no longer a weak Shinobi I need to worry about...

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.800
And the same goes for Sakura.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.770
Growth is sure a mysterious thing.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.500
Hang on, Gaara!

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.900
What's the matter, Kankuro?

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.670
Actually, my makeup remover doesn't really agree with my skin.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.200
At a time like that, you need this makeup remover gauze.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.330
It's gentle on the skin as the microfibers help remove the dirt

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.070
from inside your pores.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.330
Ooh, the Kumadori is coming right off.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.970
And not only that, if you buy now,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.200
you'll get one more for free along with a handy storage case.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.330
Whoa, this is serious. I'd better hurry right to the Sand shop.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.570
Next time: "The Jinchuriki's Tears"
