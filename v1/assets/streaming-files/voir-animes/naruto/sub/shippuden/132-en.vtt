WEBVTT

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.130
I'm a Jinchuriki too.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.700
The Akatsuki is after the Jinchuriki.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.230
So actually, I am involved.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.800
The Akatsuki will always capture a Jinchuriki alive.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.170
That means your master may not be dead.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.070
Huh?!

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.170
Are you serious?!

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.070
Never mind Sasuke. You need to save your master first.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.100
Are you really sure about this?!

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.530
Really, really sure?

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.130
Didn't I tell you?!

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.800
Our master wouldn't die so easily!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.500
I'll help you rescue your master,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.930
and I'll give you whatever information we have on the Akatsuki.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.000
Hey blondie, you're quick to understand!

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.370
Come with us and tell us about Sasuke!

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.670
Naruto...

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.970
Leave it to me, Sakura.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.430
What's your name?

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.000
Naruto?

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.330
This Naruto guy defeated Pain all by himself?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.300
That's right. He's become extremely strong.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.970
I think he's stronger than Sasuke right now.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.530
I don't care about that.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.800
My main concern is this Five Kage Summit.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.470
What are we going to do?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.400
The Leaf Village is no more.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.730
And if this Danzo, our target, is going to the Five Kage Summit,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.500
shouldn't we be heading there too?

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.230
W-What? Am I wrong?

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.900
We, Taka, will take the Hokage's head at the Five Kage Summit.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.000
We're changing our destination.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.600
Sounds like a plan.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.170
So, where is this Five Kage Summit taking place?

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.300
This is becoming a really bothersome situation.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.130
Zetsu!

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.570
My clone will guide you.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.430
Okay, follow me!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.000
Can we trust them?

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.200
We'll wait and see for now.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.930
If I sense anything suspicious,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.530
I'll get rid of them with my Amaterasu.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.670
There's something I've been meaning to test out anyway.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.200
All is going as planned.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.430
Not everything.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.500
Nagato's Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth was supposed to be used for my benefit.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.300
I never expected he would use it for something other than that.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.500
To betray me...

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.870
Even if Sasuke should become stronger than Nagato,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.200
it is meaningless if he cannot be controlled.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.170
It will be awhile

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.270
before I consider letting him synchronize with the Gedo Statue.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.330
We need to keep an eye on him.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.930
So you had contingent plans in case Nagato died?

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.430
Somewhat.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.270
However, it's certainly not what I had in mind.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.300
Naruto Uzumaki...

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.670
He managed to put a small dent in my plan.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.170
What next then? Make our move?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.930
We're done moving ahead cautiously.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.400
Let us push forward on "Project Tsuki no Me."

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.330
Five Kage Summit's Eve

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.970
This should do.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.070
All right, let's hear about Sasuke.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.730
Tell us what you know.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.800
Anything and everything about him.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.200
Well? Start talking!

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.100
I can't do it.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.100
I can't sell Sasuke out.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.800
Quit playing around!

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.830
You can't take it back now, after all that's been done.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.930
Still, Sasuke is also a ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.330
He is a comrade!

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.470
We would risk our lives to save him. That's the Hidden Leaf way.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.200
Naruto... This is a once in a lifetime request.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.870
Please... Please bring Sasuke back.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.670
Well?! Say something!

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.330
To be a ninja is to confront hatred.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.200
Each and every one of us battles hatred.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.570
However, if there is justice in vengeance,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.270
then justice will only breed more vengeance.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.300
And trigger a cycle of hatred.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.070
I know I'm being selfish.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.530
But I can't sell out Sasuke.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.030
Why you... I understand your desire for revenge.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.670
But if you let your hatred rule and you kill Sasuke,

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.170
this time, my comrades may not put up with it!

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.030
Eye for an eye!

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.130
The vicious cycle will start all over again!

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.800
The people we want to protect will kill each other off one after another!

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.630
Your Sasuke is the one who started it all!

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.130
I don't give a damn what you say!

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.830
We're going to kill Sasuke!

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.030
Then where do you suggest we take our hatred?

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.200
How would you take responsibility for that?

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.930
Beat me up until your heart's content.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.530
That's about all I can offer...

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.700
You sure know how to spit convenient words, don't you?!

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.400
Let's test your theory.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.030
See if it would really make me feel better, huh?!

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.230
How's that?! And that! And that!

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.430
Take that!

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.370
How far did they have to go to gather intel?

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.230
We're in foreign territory. I hope they're not doing anything stupid.

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:43.830
But all this damage to Hidden Leaf Village...

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.230
Who could've stopped such a powerful foe?

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.470
Taking on the Akatsuki all by himself...

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.470
I never thought Naruto would come this far.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.630
He's a true hero. He deserves to become our Hokage.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.330
- Yeah! - Definitely.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.270
That story is true.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.930
Apparently Sasuke Uchiha had the Akatsuki robe on.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.600
I see. So Sasuke is really...

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.570
Sakura, I'm sorry.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.730
I have Anko being followed by Dajim and Tera, both skilled men.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.870
Perhaps now is the time to dispose of her.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.200
This is a crucial time.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.230
I want to avoid any mishaps that could worsen the situation.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:13.000
Increase our troops. Get Kabuto before Anko does.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:19.400
That man might know about my connection to Orochimaru.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.300
Kabuto has the research data from Orochimaru's human experiments.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.470
We must get that data without fail.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.970
I'm certain it will be useful for my right eye and left arm.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.670
Foo and Torune, you two stay here.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.200
Terai, I'll rely on you to deal with Kabuto.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.030
Now go!
Yes sir!

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.070
Now, I must leave for the Five Kage Summit Conference.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.870
Except in special cases,

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.500
we are only permitted to bring a maximum of two retainers to the summit.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.700
You are the top two in the Foundation.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.500
I have decided that you shall accompany me.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.900
Masks are forbidden. Remove them.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.400
What level of arms are we allowed for your protection?

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.430
Do not concern yourself with any limitations.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.930
I'll leave it to your judgment, Foo.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.570
Yes sir.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600
Torune...

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.530
Make sure your subordinates watch Naruto.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.670
I doubt that Sai would do anything to betray the Foundation.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.200
But it's a precaution.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.070
Yes sir.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.670
They are to make certain

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.800
that the Nine-Tails does not leave the village.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.370
You bastard.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.770
Let me make this clear!

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.830
No amount of pummeling is going to make me feel better!

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.030
I won't stop until you start talking about Sasuke!

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.370
Don't interfere.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.330
He asked for this.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.830
Sai... Stay out of this.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.630
Naruto...

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.230
You don't have to get beaten up for Sasuke's sake.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.970
Shut up. It's my choice.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.930
I used to really hate Sasuke.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.630
But we ended up on the same team and we had a great time.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.130
Sasuke is my friend.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.700
A precious bond that I forged after so long.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.130
Sasuke...keeps hurting you over and over again.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:08.770
If I were you...

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.570
If you get in the way, we'll beat you up too.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.000
Enough already, Karui.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.200
Beating them up won't get us anywhere.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.570
You should know that.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.130
He promised to help us rescue Lord Killer Bee.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:42.630
What?! Where's your usual skepticism about promises being honored?

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.930
This isn't like you at all!

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.430
Naruto...

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.570
No matter what we do, he refuses to sell out his friend.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.230
He may be a foe, but I like guys like him.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.800
A man shouldn't be loose with words.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.830
However much you thrash him, he won't betray Sasuke.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.070
He's the type who means what he says.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.800
Captain Samui.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.300
Omoi, Karui.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.770
How goes the intel-gathering?

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.370
I hope you haven't gotten into trouble.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.170
Never mind that.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.100
We've learned that Lord Killer Bee may be alive!

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.330
Let's go and save him!

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.130
First, we have to find the Akatsuki hideout!

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.770
And then what?

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.170
Just the three of us will take on a foe

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.770
who managed to capture Lord Killer Bee himself?

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.000
Besides, we don't even know how many hideouts the Akatsuki has.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.700
Where do we start?

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.430
We need to gather intel, and then analyze it.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.870
That comes first!

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.570
We cannot repeat what happened back then with Yugito.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.830
We'll take the intel we've gathered directly to Lord Raikage!

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.130
There is too much information to sort out.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.700
T-Take me with you.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.500
I want to help you guys save your Jinchuriki.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.500
Naruto!

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:10.700
And I...have something I want to discuss with the Raikage.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.000
Lord Raikage? You've got to be kidding!

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.870
Karui...

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.970
So this child is Naruto.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.100
Naruto Uzumaki...the one everyone in this village is talking about.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.800
We don't know enough about you.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.100
And with Lord Raikage on the road under minimal guard,

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.730
there's no way I can have you meet him.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.500
Karui, Omoi. Let's get going!

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.630
We have permission to inspect the intel on Sasuke and the Akatsuki.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.470
It'll take time to transfer the notes and I need your help.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.600
Sai... What is it?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.300
Take me to Kakashi Sensei and Captain Yamato.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.030
Okay. Here...

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.300
I'm going to get the medicine box. I'll be right back.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.430
What's...with that glum look?

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:12.870
Kakashi Sensei.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.200
I see.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.530
Naruto did that, did he?

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.770
Kakashi Sensei.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.800
What is so precious about this bond with Sasuke

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.100
that only hurts Naruto and Sakura?

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.700
Why do those two keep putting up with the pain it causes?

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.730
Sai... You're assigned to keep an eye on Naruto, right?

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.270
W-Well that's... It's all right. I'm aware of it.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.030
Stepping in to save Naruto isn't part of your duty.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.500
You've probably begun to realize it too, Sai.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.400
You should let Sakura take a look at that.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.600
No, it's okay.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.370
If she sees me like this, it'll just cause more trouble.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.230
Besides, I heal fast.

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:10.930
Sai...

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.070
What you did earlier... Thanks.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:18.600
No problem.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.270
Boy, they really worked you over.

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:23.670
Oww!

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.570
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.530
You'd better take some time to recuperate.

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.070
I'm going to see the Raikage!

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.200
What are you saying?!

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.500
The Five Kage Summit is about to convene!

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.700
It is agreed that every Hidden Village will exercise restraint

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.970
in leaving their lands and conducting radical missions!

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.830
What will you do by seeing him?

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.630
I'm going to convince him to forgive Sasuke!

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.170
Right now, you don't even have the necklace that seals the Tailed Beast!

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.770
A Jinchuriki like you must not leave the village!

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.230
It was bad enough that

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.900
as many as eight tails transformed during that last battle!

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.200
We were lucky that the Seal activated in time

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.470
to suppress the Nine-Tails, but who knows about the next time?

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.830
Besides, I'm in charge of the village reconstruction.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.100
I cannot stay by you all the time!

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.930
I met the Fourth Hokage.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.330
That last time, it was the Fourth Hokage

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.070
who stopped my Nine-Tails transformation.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.430
W-What does he mean?

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.130
The Fourth Hokage passed away a long...

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:27.070
There are still many mysteries to the Sealing Jutsu, the Reaper Death Seal.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.330
He probably sealed his own mental energy into the sealing spell.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.430
That's when the Fourth Hokage told me...

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.030
A guy wearing the Akatsuki mask

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.530
instigated the Nine-Tails incident 16 years ago.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.570
And he was so strong,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.600
even the Fourth Hokage was almost no match for him!

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.370
On top of that, he said this guy was the mastermind

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.470
that was probably using Pain.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:58.330
If Sasuke has joined the Akatsuki, then he's also being used.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.270
This is just what Lord Jiraiya feared.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.800
That incident 16 years ago...

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.200
To think he was behind it.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.900
He possessed the Sharingan.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.600
He belonged to the Uchiha clan and left the village harboring great hatred.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.930
And only he, Madara, is capable of summoning the Nine-Tails.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.300
Anything is possible if it involves Madara.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.900
So he's still alive.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.270
Madara...

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.730
That vision and chakra more ominous than mine...

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.630
It's just like Madara Uchiha from long ago.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.770
Who's Madara?

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.000
A man who was defeated by the First Hokage.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.370
The former leader of the Uchiha Clan of Hidden Leaf Village.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.100
The higher-ups must be informed of this.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:19:59.730
Sai!
Yes?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.200
Report this to the Hokage.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:04.800
R-Right.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.870
Naruto. What did the Fourth Hokage say to you?

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.000
Fathers like to tell their sons all sorts of things, right?

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.800
He said...he believed in me!

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.030
Good!

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.670
Naruto, you will go to the Raikage!

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:48.730
Huh?

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.530
With Yamato and I as your escorts.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.370
What?!

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.270
This is a bad idea!

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.530
What? Can't listen to what I have to say, Tenzo?

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.500
Hey! You're not supposed to call me by that name, remember?!

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.870
Now, now...

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.030
Naruto, are you serious about going to meet the Raikage?

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.130
Of course. I'm going to ask him to forgive Sasuke.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.700
That being said, without knowing where the Raikage is...

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.000
But you're good at stuff like this, right?

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:51.700
I'm counting on you!

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.670
Huh? Jeez, you sure make it sound so easy.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.630
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Enter the Five Kage!"

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.300
Let's start the mission.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.570
Tune in again!
