WEBVTT

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.530
Playing with those building blocks,

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.570
it's a given I was able to complete it, at my level now.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.400
You're expected to do something like that.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.780
The next one won't be easy, that's a fact.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.650
Oh… So this is connected to that room where I scrambled with Nine Tails.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.610
Take a good look.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.610
This time, it's a statue of the Eight Tails.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.440
This is a drag every time!

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.440
Here's the entrance to another room.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.610
For the final Tailed Beast training!

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.070
Now stop complaining!

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.570
I'm gonna teach you the most powerful jutsu for a Jinchuriki.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.230
What do you say? Preparations okay?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.900
Right! I have to know how to control stuff.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.570
So? What do I do first?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.320
Transform into a Tailed Beast in Tailed Beast mode!

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.400
This is number one. Now it's your turn!

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.400
Hurry and get it done.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.070
Isn't that dangerous?

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.480
Transforming into a Tailed Beast is sorta scary.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.530
You can do it now, fool, ya fool.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.820
'Cuz you can draw out pure Tailed Beast chakra.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.480
It's not gonna run wild, ya fool!

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.150
Well then…

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.190
Visualize your Tailed Beast, ya fool!

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.030
Can't, huh? Too bad.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.530
Well, it's not like you're pals with the Nine Tails…

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.440
Anyway, Tailed Beast Transformation is a dismal failure.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.940
So how are you going to teach him the Tailed Beast Bomb?

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.820
That's the first trick a Jinchuriki can use

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.320
after going into Tailed Beast State, Bee.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.360
Man, I'm dead tired.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.940
So I used the Nine-Tails' chakra all for nothing?

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.980
By the way…shouldn't you tell him that this Tailed Beast mode is risky?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.190
Bee, the risk for you and Naruto is fundamentally different.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.570
Look, I'll explain. Let me out.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.480
I hand over the baton for the mumble jumble

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.780
Saves me from the verbal fumble… Hey! Naruto!

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.230
I'm the Eight Tails, not Bee.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.480
Now listen carefully to what I tell you!

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.980
Man, this is so complicated.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.570
But you don't talk in rhymes, so it's easier to understand.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.150
First, I'll go over the risk when you switch to Tailed Beast chakra mode.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.480
Risk?

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.110
There's a risk to this mode?!

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.780
Big time!

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.400
It's very important, so be quiet and listen.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.440
Y-Yeah…

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.820
Secrets of the Reanimation Jutsu

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.280
The risk when you switch to Tailed Beast chakra mode…

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400
That's…!

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.570
Yes?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.610
NARUTO NINE-TAILS' CHAKRA OWN CHAKRA Basically, when you're in Tailed Beast chakra mode,

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.320
NARUTO NINE-TAILS' CHAKRA OWN CHAKRA your own personal Naruto chakra is being taken by the Nine Tails!

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.480
Because you momentarily shelve your own chakra

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.480
in order to use the Nine Tails' chakra.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.860
OWN CHAKRA So of course, if your own chakra is emptied out completely…

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.440
ZERO you're a goner.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.570
Huh?! But how come Mr. Eight Tails is okay?!

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.030
Even if you take over the Nine Tails' chakra,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.860
you haven't really tamed him.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.320
Bee and I were like that in the past.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.900
We competed for each other's chakra.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.320
Oh and, you shouldn't use Shadow Clones

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.400
when you're in Tailed Beast chakra mode.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.480
Shadow Clones made from your own chakra will be taken.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.280
They'll be gone in an instant, and you'll die.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.570
But my chakra takes the Nine Tails' chakra that's been leaking

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.530
and reconstitutes it or whatever… so I have lots.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.650
Fool! Don't underestimate the Nine Tails!

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.320
He'll wipe out your chakra!

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.190
Restoring your stolen chakra takes time!

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.320
So be careful!

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.190
If you get carried away and use only the Nine Tails' chakra in battle,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.190
you'll end up dead.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.980
W-Wha…?

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.280
By rights, you and the Tailed Beast should negotiate how you both use chakra.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.400
But Nine Tails isn't the type to do that.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.030
Also, there's a limit to the chakra you managed to tug out of the Nine Tails.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.940
So much risk…

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.070
And yet, I can't use a Jinchuriki's ultimate jutsu?

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.190
Well, forget about Tailed Beast Bomb.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.900
You should just concentrate on polishing up your special moves.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.570
Tailed Beast Bomb? What kind of jutsu is that?

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.480
Oh, it's simple.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.440
You take your chakra and change its form…

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.780
gather it up and compress it… Then just spew it out.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.400
Like that time…

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.400
It's almost like vomiting.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.980
I wanna try it in this mode!

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.860
Like this?!

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.480
It's impossible without Tailed Beast Transformation.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.400
Anyway, I've explained it all to you.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.570
I'm gonna switch with Bee.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.480
Oh well, too bad. It can't be helped.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.820
You just have to do your special move in Tailed Beast chakra mode, is all…

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.150
Rasengan requires Shadow Clone Jutsu, so it's not suited to this mode.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.110
Chakra release and rotation…

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.280
plus change in chakra form and compression…

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.030
That's a two-person move.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.730
Tailed Beast chakra…

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.820
Your own hands and feet, that's the sensation.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.360
And the real ones, are just an illusion.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.530
I see…

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.150
Maybe like this?

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.150
Not bad at all.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.190
Try that special move of yours. That move you already have.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.150
All right!

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.940
Rasengan!

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.650
Huh?!

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400
This is…!

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.480
Change in chakra form with rotation and compression…

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.730
That jutsu!

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.440
It's exactly like the Tailed Beast Bomb, fool, ya fool!

00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.900
Hey! Naruto!

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.480
Who taught you that jutsu, ya dimwit?!

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.610
Huh?! Well, it was Pervy Sage…

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.400
I mean, Jiraiya Sensei.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.190
But the Fourth Hokage invented it.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.480
Fourth Hokage…?

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.150
What a coincidence. Or maybe fate?

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.440
Truly not a shame!

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.860
Rasengan!

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.480
The method is exactly the same as Tailed Beast Bomb.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:26.900
It's exactly the same!

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.110
Created with the Tailed Beast Bomb in mind!

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.690
That's the Rasengan!

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.860
It's like he entrusted you with the Tailed Beast Bomb.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.230
You couldn't have been luckier.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.150
It's easy when you're in Tailed Beast mode.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.110
Change in Chakra Form as a human is impossible.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.230
If you add rotation, it makes it more plausible.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:55.400
Yeah, but… I can't do it as well as my usual Rasengan.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.480
Tailed Beast chakra is a combination of

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.480
positive blue chakra and negative red chakra.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.110
Their ratio is key.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.690
During compression, if you change the red to blue ratio to 2:8,

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.030
it will become a ball!

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.610
Try it!

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.860
Okay!

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.610
You haven't got it yet.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.150
Your red is at 9.5 and blue is 0.5!

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.610
It looks easy, but it's hard.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.530
All of a sudden, there's talk of positive and negative,

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.400
red and blue chakra, and numbers…

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.440
I don't understand this stuff!

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.400
Besides, this Rasengan is heavy.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.400
I have to use both hands or it'll break apart.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.230
I can't be bothered with all those details.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.730
I'm the type that learns by doing things.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.730
So as for this Tailed Beast Rasengan,

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.150
I'm gonna keep doing it and doing it…

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.480
Until I get it right!

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.860
It's impossible in human form… it's a tougher toil.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.320
Rest a bit.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.780
The wounds on your hands are a type of jutsu recoil.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.440
I told you, I can't worry about the details.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.280
Octopops, you said the ratio should be 8:2.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.530
Keep watching me and tell me when I get it…

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.980
I want to remember what that feels like!

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.900
You sure are a persistent guy.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.400
Very well. I take back what I said.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.730
Looks like that woman is still alive.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.400
Lord Orochimaru's Curse Mark has adapted to this woman…

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.400
His chakra flows through her body now.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.480
She can't be killed yet.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.480
No, get rid of her now.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.230
This woman knows where the real entrance to our hideout is.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.440
I need to extract Lord Orochimaru's chakra while she is alive

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.280
and collect it.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.150
You might as well call my body Lord Orochimaru's.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.530
It's crucial in order to increase my own strength.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.780
Then my power to bind the Reanimation Jutsu will increase.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.030
And another crucial thing is…

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.980
This jutsu requires a live human body.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.400
That is why this woman is being kept alive.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.440
Increasing our battle strength…

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.530
Doesn't that further your cause? Or am I wrong?

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.440
Today's friend is tomorrow's foe. That may be so.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.280
Your benefit could turn into my disadvantage.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.530
You still don't trust me, do you?

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.440
What do you want from me?

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.070
Prove to me right now

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.440
that the Reanimation Jutsu really requires living bodies.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.320
And…tell me all of its secrets.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.440
Including how to stop it!

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.530
And if I refuse?

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.440
You will never acquire what you desire and

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.360
what you desire will become something else…

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.480
It will be your life!

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.570
It's not wise to take on someone who uses Rinnegan right now.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.980
Well, I still have a hand to play.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.480
No need to rush it.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.070
Fine… But I don't have any sacrifices here.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.110
As I said, this woman cannot be used.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.820
Those people are…?

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.610
Danzo's dogs.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.440
They've been under a Sharingan-based genjutsu

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.940
from the time of their capture.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.570
You don't go easy, do you?

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.070
All right, I got things ready for you.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.440
I killed this one.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.610
Now use this other one and do the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.780
Let me say this first.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.530
This is categorized as a type of Summoning Jutsu.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.230
I summon the soul of the dead person from the afterlife to this plane.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.860
To achieve that, I need a portion of the one I want to revive.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.530
A fixed portion of flesh.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.530
A portion that contains personal identification material.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.530
Without it, the Reanimation Jutsu will not work.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.650
Furthermore, if the soul is not in the afterlife…

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:14.320
Namely, if the soul has been sealed somewhere else,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.940
they cannot be revived.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.440
In the past,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.110
Lord Orochimaru tried to bring back the Fourth Hokage and failed.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.730
That was because the god of death had already taken the Hokage's soul

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.650
with the sealing jutsu, the Reaper Deal Seal.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.400
And the Third Hokage also used the same jutsu

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.570
during the destruction of Hidden Leaf Village.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.190
The First and Second Hokage were taken along too…

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.320
So that means…

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.400
Reanimation Jutsu can't be used on the First through Fourth Hokage?

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.030
That's right…

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.610
I've brought many back to life…

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.030
But it wasn't easy to harvest their personal information material.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.610
It's basically just grave robbing.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.440
It's hard to identify decaying bodies…

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.320
I had a lot of failures.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.610
So this is the jutsu formula?

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.400
This is how you turn a living person into a vessel for the dead one's soul.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.570
Then the Reanimation Jutsu is complete.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.400
Th-This is…?!

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.980
You can call this jutsu

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.610
the most powerful jutsu in the shinobi world.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.940
The Second Hokage devised it and Lord Orochimaru perfected it.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.190
It's their greatest legacy to the world!

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.820
I control his personality with this tag.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.860
And once I assign his orders…

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.400
All the abilities he had in life will be restored to this decaying man.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.980
And he will become my puppet who obeys my orders and cannot die.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.730
Naturally, even rare abilities like the Rinnegan of the Six Paths

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.110
and Itachi's Sharigan.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.820
But I could not find Shisui Uchiha's body anywhere.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.070
Jiraiya's body is deep in the ocean

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.570
where the pressure is too strong for anyone to venture in.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.400
As for weapons like Danzo's right eye and Pain of the Six Paths,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.360
I don't have all the materials with their personal information.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.570
Don't get carried away.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:53.860
Well, no matter.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.440
We have more than enough pawns.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.230
A jutsu this ideal has to have risks.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.730
The most amazing thing about this jutsu is that…

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.480
there is no risk for the jutsu user.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.650
What?

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.820
It's true.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:16.780
The Reanimation Jutsu has no risk. Well, it does have one.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.570
Because it is such an amazing, powerful jutsu,

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.980
the name of its wielder will spread to every corner of the world.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.230
In name, I will be more famous than Madara Uchiha.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.280
But an academic like me has no desire for fame.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.900
I'll just become a target.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.440
Don't get ahead of yourself!

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.280
There is a reaction to every action.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.320
Stay focused.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.980
I appreciate your advice.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.190
If this jutsu has a risk,

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.400
it's that I've given you information about it.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.570
Well, I must be going.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.980
Academics are better suited to be in gloomy places.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.230
Hold it!

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.530
You didn't tell me how to stop the Reanimation Jutsu yet.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.030
Oh! That's right.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.820
I almost forgot.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.400
Killing the jutsu user won't stop this jutsu.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.110
So what do you do?

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.440
It's quite easy really.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.980
You manipulate me, the one who controls the Reanimation Jutsu…

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.480
into breaking the jutsu by weaving the signs…dog, horse and tiger.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.320
With your Sharingan, for instance.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.820
Otherwise, you can seal away

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.980
the souls of those under the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.150
That's fine and good, if it's true.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.480
I'm not brave enough to lie to you.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.280
Anyway, this conversation is over.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.400
I've told you how to stop it.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.610
I'm going.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.110
As long as I have that other jutsu along with the Reanimation Jutsu,

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.690
I am invincible.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:00.110
In time, I will unravel the truth of the Sage of Six Paths.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.440
Is White Zetsu's spore tailing him?

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.480
Of course.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.860
Then Black Zetsu, you can start preparations for that other thing.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.940
Understood.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.150
I would have missed this without Muta Aburame's intel.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.230
A large army is approaching underground!

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.610
We're going to widen our scope!

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.400
They're going to try to pass right under us!

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.070
Are they planning to take the rear of the Allied Force?

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.150
Use Earth Style and dig them up!

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.150
Notify Kitsuchi immediately.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.690
Intel Unit!

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.320
Get word about it to Kitsuchi immediately!

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.980
INTEL UNIT SQUAD 1 It's coming!

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.570
All right!

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.690
New intel. INTEL UNIT SQUAD 2

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.820
Finally. INTEL UNIT SQUAD 2

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.820
MAIN BATTLE REGIMENT, SECOND COMPANY CAPTAIN KITSUCHI

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:58.480
Enemy, roughly 20,000. Coordinates: 25 by 30, underground! MAIN BATTLE REGIMENT, SECOND COMPANY CAPTAIN KITSUCHI

00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:59.820
So that's how they're coming.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.730
Reinforcements…

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.900
The Reanimation Jutsu…

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.650
It's more refined than the one the Second Hokage Tobirama used.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.480
To control this many souls at one time…

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:21.820
It's quite a feat.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.110
Kiba! Shino!

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.190
That was fast, Kiba.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.570
I was told to join you here!

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.730
Is the enemy near?

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.530
– Earth Style! Erupt! – Earth Style! Erupt!

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:41.070
So this is neither heaven nor hell.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.400
You shouldn't be here…

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.610
Mister Kakashi, please stop us again!

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.610
I'm already dead. I died human!

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.230
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "An Old Nemesis Returns"

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.230
Yeah, I know. AN OLD NEMESIS RETURNS

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:04.570
AN OLD NEMESIS RETURNS

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:09.360
Tune in again!
