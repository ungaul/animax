WEBVTT

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.400
MAIN BATTLE REGIMENT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF: GAARA

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.690
So…Who's our captain? FIRST COMPANY: MID-RANGE BATTLE UNIT

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.610
That spacey looking guy over there.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.940
FIRST COMPANY CAPTAIN: DARUI

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.230
I-I'm starting to feel nervous. SECOND COMPANY: CLOSE-RANGE BATTLE UNIT

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.230
In war, stay calm… and composed!

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.940
Hold on…my dad's Captain?!

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.780
It's finally time! SECOND COMPANY CAPTAIN: KITSUCHI

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.280
With Kurotsuchi beside me, I'll turn the tide of battle! SECOND COMPANY CAPTAIN: KITSUCHI

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.820
Are you all right, Guy Sensei?

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.730
The fighting hasn't started! What did you do? THIRD COMPANY: INTERMEDIATE-RANGE BATTLE UNIT

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.030
THIRD COMPANY CAPTAIN: HATAKE KAKASHI

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.900
I'd better eat while I still can! FOURTH COMPANY: LONG-RANGE BATTLE UNIT

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.280
Gaara is the captain of our Fourth Company,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.820
but he's also the commander-in-chief.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.940
As his deputy, you're essentially the captain of the Fourth Company.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.900
Stay sharp!

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.440
What a bothersome assignment!

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.480
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND FOURTH COMPANY CAPTAIN: GAARA

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.400
Maybe I'll make a name for myself in this war and become the Hokage! FIFTH COMPANY: SPECIAL BATTLE UNIT

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.780
You fool… Don't make light of war!

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.530
We have to avoid showing off.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.570
You don't have to worry about that, Shino…

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.570
FIFTH COMPANY CAPTAIN: MIFUNE

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.190
Now then, Gaara.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.530
You are the commander-in-chief.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.360
Please address everyone when you're ready.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.820
For My Friend

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.400
They're on the move!

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.860
And there's a large amount of them.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.230
Join up with the main forces and inform them of this!

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.480
I will remain here and investigate the hideout!

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.570
It's too dangerous by yourself!

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.230
Quiet! Just go!

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.570
I'm aware of the risks!

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.400
But if we don't get word to them,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400
our comrades will be in greater danger!

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.480
Zabuza…

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.190
I know… This isn't the next plane.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.650
I'm totally conscious, yet my body is moving on its own.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.570
This is the Forbidden Jutsu… the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.610
Someone summoned us back to this world.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.230
It means we're going to be fighting from now on.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.780
Someone's taking advantage of dead people, eh…

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.230
I don't like being used by any such person!

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.570
You will be our Commando Unit.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.940
Go by air!

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.070
Sasori and Deidara will lay traps and conduct enemy raids.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.440
Chukichi of the Hidden Mist and the Leaf Foundation Ninja,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.900
your job will be sensory intel and support.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.780
What is…this?

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.980
You guys are with the Akatsuki.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.980
Let me make this clear. If you try to control us…

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.480
If Akatsuki has to rely on a wimp like that to order us around,

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.530
they sure have fallen on hard times.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.570
Not only that, the only survivor is Zetsu and Tobi,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.440
the one who replaced me…

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.940
You're quite brash for being dead my good man.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.570
And you used to insist that eternal beauty is art… Hmmm!

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.150
And it's all because of that humongous

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.070
weak spot stuck on your chest, hmm!

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.400
Deidara, do you want me to kill you?

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.480
I'm already dead. And so are you, hmm.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.320
Is this really going to work?

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.940
There are too many reanimated shinobi

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.690
and it's difficult to control them all.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.610
Right now, I'm just focusing on the mobilization.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.730
Ultimately, I will direct everything.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.980
When the fighting begins, I will erase their personalities

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.610
and turn them into killing machines.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.480
There's no need to worry.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.690
Of course, it will depend on their characteristics.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.730
Sometimes, it's better not to change them.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.400
Leaving their sentiments intact will cause the enemy turmoil…

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.650
We'll aim for that weakness.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.860
Aren't you Master Dan?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.820
Yes… What we share in common is that we're dead.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.110
We have been resurrected by a Forbidden Jutsu…

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.610
summoned to inhabit the bodies of living sacrifices.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.440
What is going on anyway?

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.610
I have a bad feeling…

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.360
Aren't you taking Two-toned Zetsu?

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.280
I'm leaving Zetsu to keep an eye on Sasuke.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.780
I wouldn't put it past you to look for the chance

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.480
to take him away during the battle.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.480
I'm having the 100,000 White Zetsu travel underground…

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.820
Such a large army would only attract attention.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.400
Then we shall set out too.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.110
Now then, first…

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.320
Forgive us, Captain Anko!

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.190
Please stay alive!

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.360
This sensation… is it Orochimaru?!

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.820
No, it's not!

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.110
– Multiple Striking Shadow Snakes! – Multiple Striking Shadow Snakes!

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:31.940
Just because you have a Curse Mark,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.230
you think you're like Lord Orochimaru, Anko Mitarashi!

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.690
I could say the same about you!

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.570
Have you taken over as the leader, Kabuto Yakushi?!

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.530
Taijutsu from a bookworm will not work on me!

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.440
Wha—?!

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.570
I have no intention of fighting you with taijutsu.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.150
I'm a bookworm.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.110
Poison? Me? With all antibodies that I have?

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.650
So who is the lord now?

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.980
The antibody that Lord Orochimaru developed

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.730
will not work against this poison.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.530
It's…over…there…

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.440
Kabuto was right.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.570
At two o'clock…I see three.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.360
What's wrong?

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.900
Muta! Ranka!

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.440
You two, hurry on!

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.110
I will stall them!

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.480
The intel!

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.860
Get the intel to Headquarters!

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.360
Can a young man manage as the Commander-in-Chief?

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.780
Lord Gaara is not your average young man!

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.440
How dare you make such ignorant assumptions!

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.820
How am I supposed to know?

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.190
Until recently, we were on opposite sides!

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.440
Right back at you!

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.690
It's not like we trust you either!

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.940
So watch what you say!

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.360
To be honest, I feel the same way.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.280
Right!

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.150
Huh? What did you just say, Hoheto?

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.190
Even if Orochimaru deceived them,

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.190
the Sand were behind the plot to crush the Hidden Leaf.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.070
If it weren't for them, Lord Hiruzen would still…

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:01.360
Look… We were lucky enough to be named to the Commando Unit…

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.440
Things are just about to start…

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.150
I know that! I'm a shinobi too!

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.900
I'm not about to oppose what

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.440
our nation and village have decided…

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.650
That was just my personal opinion!

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.110
You Hidden Leaf don't have the right…

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.400
A rogue ninja from the Hidden Leaf attacked Lord Killer Bee,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.730
as well as the Five Hokage at their summit!

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.860
Are you willing to take responsibility

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.530
for the loss of Lord Raikage's left hand?

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.530
What?!

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.570
No one completely trusts each other yet.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.440
It can't be helped.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.690
After years on opposing sides,

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.150
you can't expect them to bond in a day or two.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.230
Especially the Sand and the Stone.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.280
– Why you—! – You jerk!

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.820
That's why the Hidden Stone are…

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.530
Hey you from the Hidden Mist!

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.610
What did you just say?

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.980
Since you overheard me, what the heck.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:59.440
I said that the Hidden Stone are ruffians who ignore protocol!

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:00.940
What did you say?

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.570
We have not forgotten the Hidden Stone's treachery

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.730
in the Tragedy of Yosuga Pass!

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.610
Yosuga Pass?

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.320
You're bringing up ancient history.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.480
We agreed to this unit's formation to honor Ganryu,

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.190
who wished for peace from his solitary prison.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.940
But the Mist and Stone can never become allies!

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.320
You Leaf bastard!

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.730
Want to do something about it, Hidden Cloud?!

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.320
You're gonna betray us again anyway, right, Hidden Stone?

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.940
Are the Mist just all talk?

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.980
If you have a complaint, say it with your fists!

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.650
You're the one who needs to watch what he says!

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.940
What?!

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:57.570
Wanna fight?

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.320
Sure! You Sand killed my father!

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.650
I'd be glad to kill you right here!

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.860
Hey, stop!

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.610
Huh?!

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.980
In the name of gain and profit for one's nation and village…

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.690
Shinobi have hated and hurt each other for many years,

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.480
from the First to the Third Great Ninja Wars.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.820
That hatred cried out for power, and thus, I was born.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.860
In the past, I too was hatred and power…

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.440
I was a Jinchuriki.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.570
And I hated this world and the humans in it

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.190
and thought about destroying them.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.530
This is exactly what the Akatsuki is trying to do now.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.610
However…a single shinobi from the Hidden Leaf stopped me.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:25.150
I know how you feel so well… I know it hurts.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.570
Gaara…

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.820
Naruto…

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.980
Putting us through all this trouble!

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.820
He cried for me, his enemy!

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.030
We wounded each other in battle but he called me his friend!

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.230
He saved me!

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.650
We were enemies, but we were both Jinchuriki…

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.980
When we share and experience the same pain,

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.570
there can be no bad blood!

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.570
No one is an enemy here!

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.320
Because we all bear the pain of having been hurt by the Akatsuki.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.570
The Sand…

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.900
The Stone…

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.440
The Leaf…

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.190
The Mist…

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:00.940
The Cloud are no more!

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.070
Now, there is only…

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.440
…shinobi!

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.070
If you still cannot forgive the Sand,

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.480
after this war is over, you can have my head!

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:26.940
The look in everyone's faces has changed.

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:32.650
The enemy is now after my friend who saved me!

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.190
If he falls into enemy hands, this world is finished!

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.650
I want to protect my friend!

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.190
And I want to protect this world!

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.570
But I am much too young,

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.530
too inexperienced to protect this world!

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.110
So I beg you all to lend me your strength!

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.980
You got it, Lord Gaara!

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.610
Sorry about that… No… I was wrong too.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.900
Sorry… I said too much.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.230
I apologize too.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.780
Ganryu! How did you?

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.230
It's time for all shinobi who have

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.730
felt the same pain to come together.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.610
I was told that my help would be welcome,

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.320
if I held no grudges.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.400
It means this war is so important that

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.570
they'll accept help from even someone like me.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.860
We are all one shinobi…

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.230
Yeah. Let's be one and beat some Akatsuki!

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.400
Damn right!

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:47.570
Uh-uh!

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.900
The more passionate they are,

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.900
the stronger the bond that is forged…

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.650
Right, Gaara?

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.530
You have to hand it to Lord Gaara!

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.110
Lord Gaara!

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.440
You've become a fine man… Gaara!

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.110
So now, we're all comrades.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:15.070
It's a nuisance, but I guess we have to learn all their scents!

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.610
The reputation of the Inuzuka nose is on the line.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.530
All who feel as I do! Follow me!

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.190
I did it!

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.400
Not bad.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.070
Next up is the final lesson.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.900
Sad, but true, it's hard to proceed…

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.530
But we must move forward with the deed.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:09.820
BACKUP MEDICAL UNIT SENSORY UNIT COMMANDO UNIT

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.480
The Fourth Great Ninja War…

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.230
We will win!

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.900
That goes without saying!

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.030
We will!

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.730
We will unite as one and fight until our last breath…

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.690
for the sake of our friend and this world!

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.610
We're already in enemy territory.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.610
Omoi! Go set Paper Bomb traps.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.610
Sai, you'll be on aerial surveillance.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.900
Ittan, use Earth Style to make a trench.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.610
Tango, set up a Chakra Communication antenna!

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.400
Zaji and Hoheto! You two will be on sensory and watch duty.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.940
