00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.870
Are you all right, Lord Shikamaru?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.880
I thought I might have heard you groaning.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.130
I've been having strange dreams lately.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.800
Don't tell me… Is it some memory from the past?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.970
You too?

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.180
The memories one wishes to forget most tend to stick like glue.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.560
It must be old age.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.980
I'm only 19!

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.440
Have you noticed?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.280
Even since we came here, there's been no wind.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.060
Recklessness

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.530
Yes, it's totally still.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.580
I don't have a good feeling about this at all.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.250
Hope she's faking her death smoothly.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.090
To be killed with her own jutsu…

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.420
Talk about luck.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.930
Anyone foolish enough to get killed during an initiation test…

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.720
wouldn't have been any good.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.770
You don't have to worry about Soku.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.320
What is it?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.860
Intel on Gengo, the guy that controls this village.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.950
Looks like it was collected by ANBU. Want to read it?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.790
It's smart to know about one's target.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.620
Let us see then.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.880
This is…blank!

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.710
It means they couldn't learn a single thing.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.390
Just this one sheet?

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.810
Ten shinobi lost their lives for that.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.480
It just doesn't make sense.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.980
Let me have that.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.190
I think it will be more useful in the fire.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.540
Oh, the dead have returned.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.000
Looks like you pulled it off.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.800
Pretending to be dead is like, creepy.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.090
Otherwise, you would have become a shinobi of this land.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.600
You should be happy… Now you can move around freely.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.980
So? Did you learn anything?

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.980
Regarding Gengo, we have, like, nothing.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.770
And no one knows anything about the inside of the castle.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.740
It seems the man known as Gengo rarely appears before others.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.280
I learned one thing though.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.370
That castle is known as Fushu Castle.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.700
Fushu?

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.750
As in prisoners of war…

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.160
A derogatory term used by the mainstream for savage tribes

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.750
along the border.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.710
Like, I can't believe anyone would name their own castle such a name.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.720
What of Sai?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.510
Nothing at all.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.970
Tsk… Well, it seems this Gengo is a very cautious man.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.390
He's worth looking into.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.520
Okay, why don't we go have some yakiniku…

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.900
Hey Pops! You call this yakiniku?

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.490
You can leave if you got any complaints!

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.780
I didn't say I wasn't gonna eat it!

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.740
Everyone's short of supplies.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.120
That's way better than nothing!

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.830
Like, there are guys from all over the place.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.880
People without money are probably lured here by these requests.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.840
How long since you opened up shop?

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.970
About the same time Gengo came, so around ten years.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.260
This village was doing worse back then.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.770
This Gengo fellow is an outsider too?

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.690
He and his gang showed up out of the blue,

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.190
and kicked out the domineering Feudal Lord.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.650
Feudal Lords are all useless.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.360
And did living conditions improve?

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.490
Well, what do you think? Take a look around!

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.240
They're all Gengo's followers.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.540
They boss everyone around.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.290
It was great that he kicked out the Feudal Lord…

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.710
but after that, he just took over.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.960
I've seen that face somewhere…

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.260
I was just thinking the same thing.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.650
There's no mistake.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.280
That is Minoichi, a former member of the ANBU.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.660
I totally thought he'd died somewhere.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.740
I don't remember anyone like him.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.290
Well, no wonder. This was during the last Great War.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.840
He killed everyone in his unit and went into hiding.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.880
Damn it, I can't stand the sight of him.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.630
So, like, what's he doing here, acting so high and mighty?

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.720
Well, we'll have to ask him that directly.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.820
Wh-Who are you guys?!

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.660
You can't run away anymore, Mr. Minoichi.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.120
I-I don't know that name!

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.620
Don't play dumb with me!

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.670
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.920
Clearly, you remember it…

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.340
If you're from Hidden Leaf Village,

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.970
you know just what this jutsu can do, don't you?!

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.430
S-Stop!

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.560
You've moved up in the world,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.560
considering you killed all your comrades.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.400
Don't think you can get away from shinobi law!

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.810
I-I'm not a shinobi anymore!

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.480
I'm a revolutionary!

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.690
A revolutionary?

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.740
All of you living your idle lives in the stagnant world of shinobi

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.240
couldn't possible understand our noble intentions!

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.330
Enough of your stupid arguments!

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.910
Or do you want me to kill you right here?

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:43.910
S-Stop!

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.500
Now answer me!

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.800
Tell me all you know about this guy, Gengo!

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.510
Start talking!

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.970
Lord Shikamaru!

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.860
Revolutionaries…earn that title when they have had their eyes opened by

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.910
Lord Gengo's divine will.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.620
That's pretty lofty talk.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.750
This land does not need lowly men like Feudal Lords.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.540
We will create the ideal society for the shinobi.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.840
That's the true revolution envisioned by Lord Gengo.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.430
Lord Sai of the Hidden Leaf is supposedly being held captive here.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.890
Will you tell us where he is?

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.770
You're Ro, aren't you?

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.820
Who cares about shinobi law?!

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.190
I've had enough of dying for the sake of Feudal Lords!

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.610
I'll do anything to protect myself!

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.070
Tsk… At last, you revealed your true self.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.830
A coward like you would understand how I feel, right, Ro?

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.960
D-Don't!

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.880
What're you talking about?!

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.710
Don't you know what he did?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.600
That pressure point paralyzes the whole body.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.430
He'll be out for a while.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.310
Ro!

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.650
Are you okay, Ro?!

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.770
Ro!

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.730
You're up.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.480
Like, you had me worried.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.570
I was…dreaming.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.900
It's okay if you don't wanna talk about it.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.950
It's funny how the memories one wishes to forget most

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.370
tend to stick like glue.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.620
It was back when I was still a genin.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.340
My unit was ambushed by the enemy and…annihilated.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.260
I was the lone survivor,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.140
so I buried myself under the corpses of my comrades…

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.770
and I suppressed my chakra for days, pretending to be dead.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.310
Thanks to the jutsu I mastered during that time,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.150
I was picked up by the ANBU.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.610
But this jutsu is a cursed power…

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.820
acquired from the slaughter of my comrades.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.160
The same thing happened to me…

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.160
The revolutionaries are like, gathering in the square.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.290
They're planning something.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.250
Let's go.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.930
But we can't go looking like this.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.140
We need like, two more.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.360
Ro, is the chakra disguise ready?

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.110
I've already traced the clothing's owner.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.200
Soku, we're counting on you if anything happens.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.160
Soku, are you listening?

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.830
Hey, you!

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.050
Fix that collar!

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.640
Lord Gengo is going to address us!

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.350
Shape up!

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.060
I'm sorry.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.180
If you're not doing anything, help with the preparations!

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.270
Understood?

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.770
Perfect timing, wasn't it?

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.770
It almost seems too perfect…

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.070
But we can't pass up this opportunity if Gengo's gonna appear.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.790
From this spot, we can get Gengo, no matter where he tries to hide.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.170
Soku, stay alert. You've been spacing out.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.550
What Minoichi was saying… Huh?

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.260
Kick out the Feudal Lords and create the ideal world for shinobi.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.890
It's not a bad idea.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.810
What are you saying?

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.390
I like, just can't accept this system

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.230
with useless Feudal Lords at the top.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.900
Don't deny ever thinking that too, Ro!

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.240
I get where you're coming from.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.070
But focus on the mission right now.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.200
Distraction leads to mistakes.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.040
Like I need to be reminded.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.220
The stage is undefended…

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.100
Either this Gengo is really confident,

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.140
or really stupid.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.270
He's finally going to appear.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.150
Let's expose this guy for what he really is!

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:58.290
First, I thank everyone who has come together here.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.790
Everyone…

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.550
The day is near for true revolution!

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.220
We'll have a better chance of catching Gengo with Shadow Stitching

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.140
if we move up closer.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.560
Follow me.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.770
Tonight, I've planned something special.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:27.650
Allow me to introduce someone who tried to obstruct our true revolution!

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.130
Sai!

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.300
Everyone…What shall this man's fate be?

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.680
Death!

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.220
A sacrifice for our revolution!

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.230
Your wishes have been heard.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.520
With the red blood of this man,

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.900
the true revolution for justice will take another leap forward!

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.490
Are you going to ignore Lord Sai?!

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.000
We're helpless against that crowd.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.000
I'm gonna use this.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.830
EXPLOSION EXPLOSION A diversion?

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.880
Ten years have passed quickly since I rose up in this land.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.920
Many comrades have joined me and this land has started to flourish.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.840
However…!

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.810
not a single one of our hopes has yet been realized.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.770
I want ask the citizens of the Land of Silence!

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.740
This land under the rule of the Feudal Lord…

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.490
and this land now— which is the better world to live in?

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.780
Feudal Lords who have nowhere near

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.620
our strength or intelligence have ruled over the shinobi.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.120
But that dark age is a thing of the past.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.380
We, the revolutionaries, will protect this land!

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.130
The wish of the revolutionaries is to push forward

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.550
to make this land rich and prosperous!

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.090
Damn it!

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.890
The ones who should rule this land are not the Feudal Lords…

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.970
but we who possess the power of shinobi!

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:20.890
Hey, Ro!

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.140
– This is no time to daydream! – The shinobi is the key…

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.980
– Snap out of it! – to make this land safe and just.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.150
Lord Shikamaru!

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.650
– I was… – It's been ten years since EXPLOSION

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.780
I'm gonna rescue Sai.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.780
When you see me go around the back, lay it on real thick.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.910
Got it?!

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.990
Understood!

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.910
Why must shinobi be treated differently?

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.500
Why must we be discriminated against?

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.630
Damn it!

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.720
He's using some weird trick!

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.180
Shinobi locked in the old ways, content with their lot

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.520
content with discrimination, content to be controlled, destroyed us!

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.140
Now hear me!

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.900
People of the Land of Silence awaiting the dawn…

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:13.070
The sunlight of a new era shines on the Land of Silence!

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.870
So, you've shown yourself, rat.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.210
Your performance is over!

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.540
Protect Lord Gengo!

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.630
Lord Gengo, please take cover!

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.340
Sai, I've come to get you.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.510
You'd better not be dead.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.330
Cut it out, Sai!

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.290
I'm here to save you.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.880
I've woken up.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.800
You will soon understand too, Shikamaru.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.390
Sai, you!

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.970
Gengo, is this your doing?

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:31.560
How a shinobi of your stature would be bound by old-fashioned laws,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.730
is beyond my comprehension.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.360
Shut up! Shut up!

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.620
Why do you suppress your memories?

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.160
Are you afraid to face them?

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.040
You're not fooling me with your pretentious talk!

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.420
Soku, do it!

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.970
Too bad.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.640
Don't you dare do anything to my comrades!

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.560
Do anything to them? Of course, not.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.940
I happen to like shinobi with abilities.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.820
And of course, you happen to be one of them,

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.330
genius of the Hidden Leaf, Shikamaru Nara.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.880
It's no use.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.720
Shikamaru, you must wake up too.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.380
Stop messing around!

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:48.350
I just hate getting woken up when I'm fast asleep!

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.520
Farewell…

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.920
To be continued

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.050
Shikamaru, it's useless to hide.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:45.760
I can't use my shadows,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.670
my field of vision has been taken away… Calm down.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.050
There's still a chance an opportunity will present itself.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.010
I could break through the enemy camp with a Climbing Silver,

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.220
but a flying knight might fall prey to a pawn.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.140
Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:03.360
"Shikamaru's Story, A Cloud Drifting in the Silent Dark, Part 4: A Cloud of Suspicion"

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.940
I've no intention of becoming a sacrificial pawn!

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:28.840
Tune in again!
