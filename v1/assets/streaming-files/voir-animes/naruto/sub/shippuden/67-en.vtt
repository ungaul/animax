WEBVTT

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.700
STABILIZE

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.500
If I focus on the Rasengan,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.770
the Change in Chakra Nature becomes unstable.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.930
However, if I focus on the Change in Chakra Nature,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.400
the Rasengan doesn't turn out well.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.770
I'm so pathetic...

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.500
It's because I believe...

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.770
you're the only Shinobi who can go beyond the Fourth Hokage.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.300
That's what I believe.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.700
Here Kakashi Sensei has such high hopes for me...

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.230
And I'm not fulfilling his hopes at all...

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.730
What should we do? Should we stop for now?

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.170
If that's what he wants to do...

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.530
I... I...

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.000
Damn it!

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.400
I don't have time to just sit around!

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.430
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.930
Be careful, guys!

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.030
There's another one turning into the Nine-Tails!

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.230
Captain Yamato, help!

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.730
Tenzou, it's the Nine-Tails again!

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.530
Damn it!

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.670
You okay?

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.670
It's been one full day since you started training

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.030
to add the wind Change in Chakra Nature to the Rasengan...

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.000
And you're using around 200 Shadow Clones.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.170
It would take one person 4,800 hours to complete that training...

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.870
I guess it's still not nearly enough.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.000
But in this training, the Chakra control is too hard,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.800
and 200 Shadow Clones is my limit...

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.330
I get the feeling... I'll never be able to do this.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.870
It takes a ton of concentration

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.230
to form the Rasengan in the first place.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.870
It's too much to try to create a Change in Chakra Nature

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.870
on top of that.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.430
You're unusually negative. It's not like you.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.030
Is that the Naruto Uzumaki I know so well?

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.230
Sai... You'll catch a cold.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.600
How's Naruto doing?

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.800
Adding a Change in Chakra Nature to the Rasengan

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.030
seems harder than imagined.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.570
Naruto isn't all that intelligent to begin with, after all...

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.930
That's why Kakashi Sensei is having him learn this way...

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.200
Yeah, training only Naruto can do...

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.600
Training results are doubled with two clones,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.930
and multiplied by a hundred with a hundred clones...

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.470
But...there's a limit.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.570
It's impossible to advance with just effort and fortitude

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.270
when one is trying to incorporate

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.070
a Change in Chakra Nature into a Jutsu...

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.230
To say nothing of the fact that

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.370
the Rasengan is a Jutsu invented by the Fourth Hokage.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.500
It might not be possible for Naruto to add

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.270
a Change in Chakra Nature to such a Jutsu...

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.470
That's right. Naruto's an idiot, after all...

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.700
What?

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.200
He's clumsy and tactless.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.000
There's no way he could do something as delicate as

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.330
incorporating a Change in Chakra Nature into the Rasengan.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.870
And yet Kakashi Sensei and Captain Yamato have been

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.670
sticking it out with him all this time...

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.730
And here in the village,

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.830
they have formed units to fight against the Akatsuki.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.270
It's just...a waste of manpower.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.270
I don't understand what the Hokage can expect

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.270
from a hopeless guy like Naruto...

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.800
I'll pound you if you say anything else.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.370
What do you know about Naruto?!

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.270
Yes, Naruto is indeed a real idiot!

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.030
He's clumsy, a goof and a birdbrain!

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.430
But no one does the unexpected more than him!

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.300
He's saved us countless times!

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.500
Every time someone expects him to fail,

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.970
he proves them wrong!

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.400
That's who Naruto Uzumaki is!

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.770
If you're any kind of teammate, you'll keep that in mind!

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.430
What're you grinning about?

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.730
I'll pound you.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.470
Please, don't do that.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.000
But sometimes knowledge found in books really can be useful.

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.970
The "Understanding Other People's Feelings" series...?

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.870
"Words Reveal True Feelings..."

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.230
Sai, you...

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.730
I know that you believe in Naruto.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.100
Naruto will never let you down, Sakura.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.270
What...? You tricked me...!

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.300
It would be too much for Naruto to bear if he kept eating those awful mud balls

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.670
and didn't have any results to show for his training.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.130
What do you mean by mud balls?!

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.370
I simply prioritized effectiveness ahead of taste!

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.200
Before reading into the true feelings of others...

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.500
you should learn how not to talk about your own!

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.400
It'll be fine! Naruto will pull it off!

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.830
For crying out loud...

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.070
Naruto...

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.500
Hang in there!

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.300
But I don't think it'll work this time...

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.500
You have to do it anyway.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.000
Then could you look to the left while looking to the right

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.100
if someone told you to?!

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.030
Indeed...

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.730
That is impossible.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.570
I see... That's what this is about...

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.770
Then I guess it's not outside the realm of possibility.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.630
Huh?!

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.430
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.430
By looking to the left...

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.370
while looking to the right...

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.630
This is what you mean, right?

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.530
I get it!

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.800
Did he figure something out?

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.400
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.600
You went to the trouble of calling us back here

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.730
just to seal the Two-Tails?

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.370
It will take three days. Prepare yourselves.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.530
Three days...?

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.870
This'll take forever, man. It's raining over here.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.600
Hidan... I don't want to hear that from you.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.370
I was this close to killing all those Hidden Leaf idiots.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.570
And here I was just about to make those atheists realize

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.330
the existence of the Way of Jashin!

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.430
The Hidden Leaf aren't atheists.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.870
They consider their predecessors as gods

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.170
and act based on the philosophy of the will of fire.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.630
Well, I suppose we could call something like that

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.670
a justification to fight.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:24.930
Huh...?!

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.070
You jerk! Are you insulting me? Huh?!

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.530
No... I've no intention of insulting

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.370
your reason for fighting in particular.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.030
I'm in the same boat as you, after all.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.070
It doesn't matter what the reason for war is.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.670
Religion. Philosophy. Resources.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.270
Land. Grudges. Love.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.100
A whim...

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.530
No matter how stupid they may be,

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.770
they're all reasons worth getting into war over.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.030
There will always be war.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.970
The reason can be dealt with later...

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.630
Our Instinct is to seek out battles.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.430
Nobody's listening to your long-winded speech!

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.900
I've got my own way of doing things.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.800
I've got my own goals.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.430
I've no intention of giving up everything for this organization!

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.500
As long as you're affiliated with the Akatsuki organization,

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.830
you will collaborate with our goal.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.670
Once the Akatsuki's goal is attained,

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.500
your goals will also be realized.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.470
Heh, you can act cool all you want,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.230
but that doesn't change the fact that

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.430
all the Akatsuki wants to do is make money!

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.430
You're the same as Kakuzu...

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.170
That's the type of reason for fighting I hate the most.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:45.870
You're right...

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.800
Our immediate goal is indeed money.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:53.370
But the Akatsuki's true goal lies elsewhere.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.300
It will cost a large amount of money to realize that goal.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.430
I'm the second newest member after Tobi,

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.670
so I haven't heard any of the details from you.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.730
You just plan stuff behind my back...

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.400
Heh... Are you sulking?

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.000
Then I guess it's about time I told you.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.400
The Akatsuki's ultimate goal can be accomplished in steps.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.430
And there are three steps in total...

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.830
The first step is money.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.570
And the second step is to use that money

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.700
to create the first war contract organization

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.800
in the history of the Shinobi world.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.070
Come on!

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.570
That's the same thing the other Shinobi villages are doing.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.430
That's just completing missions and receiving payment.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.630
You want to become the leader

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.070
of some tiny village that no land will hire?

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400
How stupid...

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.300
A village in service of the land...?

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.900
You've got it all wrong...

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.500
What?

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.170
I'll explain it to you sequentially.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:06.100
LAND OF EARTH LAND OF SNOW LAND OF FIRE LAND OF WIND LAND OF WATER In lands with powerful Ninja villages, the Shinobi business assumes

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.130
a significant role in the income of these lands.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.500
You could say these Shinobi villages earn large amounts of money and

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.530
support the economy of the lands by fighting battles

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.030
both within and beyond their borders.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.430
In other words, a certain amount of war is necessary

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.770
for a land to obtain stable profit.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.430
But in this day and age, although there are small battles,

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.830
the great wars of the past are gone.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.970
The lands downsize the villages

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.700
and many Shinobi have nowhere to go.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.700
Shinobi exist to fight.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.570
That is why they are rewarded for risking their lives

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.230
for the sake of their land.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.370
The Five Great Nations are fine...

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.370
Both the lands and their villages are large and trusted.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.700
They receive several missions from other lands

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:54.900
and are quite stable.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.400
But it doesn't work that way for the smaller lands.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.800
It costs a lot to maintain a Shinobi village,

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:06.400
and those costs remain more or less the same in both war and peacetime.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.530
That being said,

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.600
if a village is downsized too drastically,

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.770
they can't survive if a war suddenly breaks out.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.170
So we will mobilize the necessary amount of Shinobi

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:22.300
only when needed without allegiance to a land...

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.470
and create an organization that, only with the necessary forces,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.870
will take on wars from small villages and land for money...

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.930
In the beginning, we'll fight any war for a small cost

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.970
and gain control of the war trade.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.700
Then we'll use the Tailed Beasts to create wars

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.130
as big or small as the market requires.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.370
And eventually...

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.870
we'll control, and have a monopoly on all wars!

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.330
In the wake of this,

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.570
the Shinobi village system of the Great Lands will collapse...

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.730
and they'll have no choice but to use the Akatsuki...

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.700
And then we'll reach our true goal, which lies ahead...

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.600
The third step of our goal...

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.400
We will...

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.230
...take over the world.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.000
I see...

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.700
Umm... about Kurenai...

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.170
Contact the relevant parties about the funeral.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.130
I'll tell Kurenai... No... I'll do it.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.900
I'll tell her.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.530
I have a message for her from Captain Asuma...

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:28.630
Yes!

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.970
Yeah! I'm kind of getting the hang of it!

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:42.830
I see... So that's what your idea was, huh?

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.530
You formed the Rasengan by using a clone

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:52.330
to handle the Change in Chakra Form while you released the Chakra.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.700
Right! I just needed a third clone

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.530
to handle the wind Change in Chakra Nature.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.300
If I can't look left and right by myself...

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.570
then I just needed to create clones

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.400
to look left and right and divide up the responsibility!

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.830
So my Shadow Clone stunt earlier gave you a hint, huh?

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.330
That being said, only Naruto has both the Chakra

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.870
and the skill with Shadow Clones for that method to work.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.170
I couldn't do it like that.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.070
I bet even the Fourth Hokage couldn't.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.370
But he...

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.030
Just what I'd expect

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.600
from the Ninja with the most unpredictability, Naruto.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.000
I'm not sure how to say it...

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.400
I've really started to take a liking to you!

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.870
YIKES!

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.230
Don't say gross stuff out of the blue like that, you jerk!

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.670
The Jutsu I went to the trouble of creating

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.930
got messed up because you freaked me out!

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.300
Uhh, I didn't mean it like that... Whoa, stay back!

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.900
I don't know quite how to say it...

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.000
Well... No!

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:01.800
For crying out loud...

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.270
What're those two doing...?

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:06.530
I have a message for you.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.070
Just a minute...

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.270
What's going on?

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.000
Kakashi Senpai!

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.330
We must stop the training for now and head back to the village!

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.000
What?!

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.400
What the heck is going on?!

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.200
Asuma Sarutobi...

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.300
...is dead.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.670
You okay, Konohamaru...?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.330
Uncle Asuma... Why...?!

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.270
Asuma...

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.200
Choji, do you know where Shikamaru is?

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.400
It looks like he isn't here yet... That's strange.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.530
And here his mom said he went out

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:55.800
after stopping by the house...

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.970
Where the heck did he go at an important time like this...?!

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.470
Next time: "Team 10"
