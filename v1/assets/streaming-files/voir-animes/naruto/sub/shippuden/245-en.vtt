WEBVTT

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.350
I'm Always Watching

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.850
What the heck...

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.270
Minato Sensei tells us to assemble and he's the one who's late!

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.770
Give me a break... You're one to talk!

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.600
What did you say?
Eh?

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.650
Come on, you two... Want to do this?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.980
Hey! Did you just scoff at me?

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.350
What of it?
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.020
You're all here, I see.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.980
Minato Sensei! Do we have a new mission?!

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.440
Not today.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.400
What is that?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.980
They're applications.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.400
I recommended you three for promotion to Chunin.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.900
Minato Sensei... You're awesome!

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.980
Hey...

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.560
Don't jump the gun.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.480
Huh?

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.980
You have to take the Chunin Exam first.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.100
What...

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.270
There are three parts to the exam

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.350
and each one is quite difficult.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.400
Oh... Are you kidding me?

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.940
You'll never pass since you can't even make it

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.440
to a rendezvous on time.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.600
What did you say?!

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.270
Hey, you two!

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.650
Anyway...

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.770
You've worked together

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.980
and earned the right to take the Chunin Exam.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.230
That's why I recommended you.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.100
However, it's not compulsory.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.480
Whether you take the exam or not is entirely up to you.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.270
I wouldn't miss it...!

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.850
CHUNIN EXAM PART ONE

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.600
Aw man!

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.690
This is a Chunin Exam,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.100
so I was expecting stuff like ninjutsu and taijutsu...

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.520
But this is a written test... the kind I'm weakest in!

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.310
Finished already?

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.440
Yes.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.270
Th-That Kakashi...!

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.560
Aw man, I'm done for...

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.480
Huh?!

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.270
I'M ALWAYS WATCHING YOU -RIN

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.400
Rin...

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.980
RIN NOHARA There it is!

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.100
I did it!

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.600
KAKASHI HATAKE

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.770
Well...

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.400
What did you expect?

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.650
That was just a written test!

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.400
Just wait and see! I'll find my name!

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.350
END OF LIST

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.150
I guess not...

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.770
Obito!

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.270
Look! There!

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.310
THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN ACCEPTED DUE TO A VACANCY OBITO UCHIHA

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.020
I did it!

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.600
A vacancy, huh... That's so like you.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.730
What?!

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.810
Come on, you two.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.060
You don't have time to celebrate!

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.310
If you passed, go to your assigned classroom!

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.980
We'll explain the second part of the exam.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.480
Part Two will commence three days from now.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.060
This will test your physical skills.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.600
Use everything you learned about taijutsu and ninjutsu...

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.270
to get through this exam!

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.230
All right! I got this!

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.270
However, this test pits your team against others.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.270
Huh? It's not an individual competition?!

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.060
Kakashi! You'd better not drag us down!

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.650
Right back at you.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.270
What?!

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.520
Will you two stop it?!

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.310
Especially...don't be late.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.100
I know!

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.900
CHUNIN EXAM PART TWO TEAM COMPETITION

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.650
Kakashi Hatake is also participating in the test, right?

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.940
Yes, he's on the next team.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.600
Ah, I'm looking forward to this.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.230
KAKASHI OBITO RIN GUY EBISU GENMA IBIKI HAYATE TOKARA

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.810
Team Minato, you have five minutes left.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.060
Will he make it?!

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.270
Yes! I'm sure he'll be here in a minute.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.480
If time runs out, you'll be automatically disqualified.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.190
I knew it! Didn't I tell you?!

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.770
You're too easy on him, Rin.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.900
That's why he'll never break this habit of being late!

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.850
He'll be here.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.730
Something must've happened to delay him.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.400
He'll make it in time.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.350
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.440
HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.270
Here, have some candy.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.150
3:00 pm.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.400
It's time to begin.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.650
Damn it, all because of him!

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.400
I know he'll...

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.150
I'm sorry I'm late!

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.770
See! I told you Obito would make it, no matter what!

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.940
Hurry, before we're disqualified!

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.440
Oh, boy!

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.230
We will now begin part two, the team competition...

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.600
Preliminary qualifier!

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.520
Begin!

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.230
Fire Style! Fireball—

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.310
CHUNIN EXAM PART THREE INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.190
I'm going to have you pay me back in full for the last time.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.400
The "last time"?

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:35.650
What?!

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.520
Don't tell me you don't remember?!

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:38.440
Who are you?

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.100
What did I do to earn your wrath?!

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.100
Why you—!

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.440
Don't take me for a fool!

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.600
Do your best, Obito!

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.310
All right... Just watch me!

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.650
Begin!

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:55.940
Huh?!

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.940
The winner is Might Guy!

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.600
What is he doing?

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.060
Do your best!

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.020
Go...!

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:23.520
Kakashi!

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.270
Stop!

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.770
The winner is Kakashi Hatake!

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:41.770
He did it!

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.480
You passed the Chunin Exam on your first try.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.850
Kakashi, you're amazing! Isn't he, Obito?

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.400
Humph.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.060
Obito...

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.100
So this is where you were.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.350
O-Oh, it's you, Rin.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.980
It's only natural that Kakashi passed.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.940
But we can too, I know it!

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.310
Let's practice hard for next year!

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.850
But it's hard to get motivated after watching Kakashi...

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.520
What are you saying?!

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.020
You're going to be Hokage, right?

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:01.520
I'm always watching you!

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:05.560
Yeah!

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.150
Obito?

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.700
I did it!

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.400
I'm a Chunin now!

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.780
Congratulations!

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.900
Meet me later at the park under the cherry tree.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.360
Today for sure...

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.860
I'm going to tell Rin how I feel about her!

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.280
Sorry I'm late...

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.450
– No... – Everyone!

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:15.820
Everyone?

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.650
Why? Uh, Why...

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.860
Why is everyone here?!

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.200
I asked them to come to discuss the gift.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.280
Huh? What gift?!

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.360
Well, Kakashi is being promoted to Jonin.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.950
So, we're going to... give him a present.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.740
CLASS PROJECT GIFT FOR KAKASHI'S PROMOTION TO JONIN (TOP SECRET MISSION)

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.530
Kakashi's a Jonin?

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.900
Oh? Didn't you know, Obito?

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.320
It's something to be proud of as his classmates.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.820
Yeah...

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.150
What do you think Kakashi would like?

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.700
Well... Since we're talking about him,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.570
it should be something useful.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.780
Now we'll do combat training.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.490
It might just be training,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.030
but if you're not alert, it can be fatal. Understood?

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.070
– Yes! – Yes!

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.070
Well...I guess that's it!

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:04.490
Show me your left hand!

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.530
Hey, it's nothing...

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.570
It's just a scrape.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.530
A little spit will take care of it.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.610
Whatever! Just show me!

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.650
I messed up...

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.070
I got some sand in my eyes and...

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.240
A scar or two on a man is a badge of courage!

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.650
I was just thinking how I needed that.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.320
So this wound's... Ouch!

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.400
Don't act tough and hide your wounds.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.450
I'm always watching you.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.400
You promised me that you would become Hokage, Obito.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.650
Listen, I want to stop this war too.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.700
I really want to save the world.

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:15.490
So I decided to stick by your side and watch over you.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.450
You told me saving you

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.110
was the same as saving the world, remember?

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.200
Yeah...

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.700
Since I'm keeping an eye on you,

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.900
you can't hide anything from me anymore.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.450
Okay! Okay!

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.280
Go for it, Obito!

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.030
Become Hokage and show me how you'll save the world.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.360
That's another promise!

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.570
Let's go!

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.650
You...

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.860
You told Kakashi Sensei you would throw away

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.570
all your memories and feelings about your comrades.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.780
But when you became the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.280
and were about to be taken over by it...

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.490
Didn't you try to suppress the Ten Tails

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.700
because you didn't want that?

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.570
The reason why you beat the Ten Tails and could control it

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.530
was because you stood firm on not throwing away the past

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.450
and stayed yourself, right?

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.820
You just couldn't throw out the memories of

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:35.240
my dad, Kakashi Sensei or this Rin person, could you?

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.650
That's how you could stay Obito

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.950
even after you became the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.400
Am I wrong?

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:57.110
But dragging everyone with you onto your path

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.700
and continuing on it won't be allowed!

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.030
I'm bringing you back as Obito Uchiha...

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.240
as a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf...

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.700
and you're going to atone for your sins.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.700
You tried to run away from every single thing.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.570
The only thing that awaits you...

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:21.650
is your personal nightmare.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.280
Solitude!

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.780
So why keep living in reality?

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.780
Now come join us, Naruto!

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.610
I bet this Rin person would say this if she were still alive...

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.320
Don't act tough and hide your wounds.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.780
I'm always watching.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.490
You're no one else but you, damn it!

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:51.860
Don't run away!

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.070
Come join us...

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.740
Obito!

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.880
I will never go over to your side!

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.670
I have no regrets with my path up until now.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.590
I told you I saw everything.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.800
Then don't keep imagining yourself as Hokage!

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.750
The person Rin wanted to watch over isn't the current you...

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.800
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Promise That Was Kept"

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.050
It was Obito Uchiha!

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:07.130
THE PROMISE THAT WAS KEPT Tune in again!
