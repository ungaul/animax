WEBVTT

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.370
I can't believe it.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.200
I know. I never knew that Lord Tsuchikage could be so crazy.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.830
Damn it... I'm going to strain my back again!

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.870
Are you sure about this?

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.410
Wouldn't it be better to go by sea?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.950
Also, we don't have to fly so high, do we?

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.200
Don't be ridiculous, Akatsuchi!

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.780
That giant snake might sense us again!

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.410
We're almost there.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.280
ASSEMBLE! ALLIED SHINOBI FORCES!

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.370
The world flipped over again.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.330
What's happening on this island anyway?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.370
Captain Yamato went to check what's going on outside,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.910
but he hasn't come back.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.530
Don't you think something happened?

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.780
We're already looking into that.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.200
You don't have to worry about it.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.200
My mission here is done!

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.370
I'm going back to the Hidden Leaf Village

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.330
to wait for Sasuke!

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.870
He and I...made an oath.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.370
Not yet?

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.080
Not yet. Just sit still.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.200
The next time you use your eyes,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.620
you'll see a completely different world.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.580
This is going to be fun!

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.580
I could care less about your war.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.910
The one who will destroy the Hidden Leaf will be me.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.410
Anko, please rest a little. You've been working nonstop.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.280
War is at our doorstep.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.660
So we have to gather as much intel as possible.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.240
Especially if our intel can save our comrades.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.330
They're here!

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.160
You're kidding, right?!

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.830
The white snake that crawled in earlier...

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.330
That chakra...is Kabuto's.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.660
This is the hideout, after all.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.080
I sent my insects to investigate.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.830
They've sensed significant signs of life underground.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.280
Tokuma, down below! Towards four o'clock!

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.830
Your Hyuga Byakugan will be able to perceive what's down there!

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.530
Please, Tokuma!

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.580
Byakugan!

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.200
Th-This is...

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.870
What do you see, Tokuma?!

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.950
Ranka! Prepare to contact Headquarters!

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.830
So many of them...

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.280
How come the animals get to go outside, but I can't?!

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.280
Impatient Naruto... Haste makes waste...

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.620
You still haven't mastered Tailed Beast Chakra control.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.660
So your training, I shall personally patrol...

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.200
When we we're done,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.200
Tailed Beast Chakra will feel like an extension of you...

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.950
They'll feel like your arms and legs, it's true...

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.240
Yeaaahh!

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.910
Whoa...

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.490
With your Tailed Beast Chakra... Catch them!

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.580
Stack 'em up like building blocks...

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.280
Using your chakra and the Tailed Beast's...

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.370
Balance those rocks!

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.410
He took the bait! Nice work, Bee!

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.330
Try it out.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.160
All right. I have to use the Nine Tails' chakra, right?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.330
I have to stack up these rocks so that they don't tumble, right?

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.450
All right! I'll do it!

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.830
Don't be reckless there. Your control is fair.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.910
But you don't have fine-tuned control.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.490
He pulverized the rock. Is it too hard to grasp?

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.620
Damn it!

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.280
One more time!

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.410
Gently...this time...

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.330
More gently... Put spirit in...leave power out.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.780
All right!

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.370
Don't get all satisfied with just one... Or you'll never get done!

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.450
The first one is always easy...

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.160
The next one is key and it won't go so breezy.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.330
Great, Bee! This will buy us plenty of time.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.200
The time has come.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.620
It seems that old Fence Sitter brought them here safely.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.410
We'll hide Turtle Island along with Bee and the Nine Tails

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.120
at the rear of our headquarters.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.910
Any objections, Princess Tsunade?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.410
Fine.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.410
I will go and welcome Lord Tsuchikage.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.200
Don't fall. Stay put...stay put.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.080
– That was so close! – Damn it!

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.370
– Turtle Island just shook. – One more time!

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.200
Does that mean we've reached our destination?

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.660
We're finally here, old man!

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.280
Ouch! My back!

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.200
That's because you overdid it!

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.280
Welcome back, Lord Tsuchikage.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.410
So what is the situation?

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.950
Both the Eight and Nine Tails are fine.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.080
But the Wood User that was guarding the Nine Tails was taken.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.370
Taken? Not taken down?

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.240
Then the enemy will learn everything about us!

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.370
At any rate, I'll go over the details inside!

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.830
Will you hurry up and start making Zetsu stronger?

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.830
Before that, extracting intel from Yamato takes priority.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.660
But please don't kill him.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.370
If you want Zetsu and the others to get stronger.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.370
I could use the jutsu of the Ningendo's Rinnegan...

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.030
and easily extract the intel.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.030
But that would kill him.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.870
So it's better to keep him alive to make Zetsu stronger?

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.160
Yes.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.450
Poison, huh?

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.280
So that's how he's suppressing the power of the Wood Style.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.330
Damn that Kabuto.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.330
He has researched the cells of the First Hashirama quite thoroughly.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.280
It's a drug I made to curtail Hashirama's power.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.660
Don't worry, I won't use it on the Zetsu.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.280
Without a doubt, he cultivated all those Zetsu

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.990
from Hashirama's cells.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.830
If he were to use this poison on them...

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.530
That Orochimaru...

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.990
He really looked deep into our organization.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.080
I can't move. Damn it!

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.740
I can't even execute my own decisions like this!

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.580
At this rate... Damn it!

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.370
Forgive me, everyone!

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.450
We don't need the power of the Rinnegan.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.200
With my truth serum...

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.240
and your Sharingan, we can glean all the intel we want.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.530
If we learn who the enemy is,

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.120
we can strike them by sending out their worst enemy.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.580
There's no need to waste chakra.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.700
SEALED

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.580
Huh?!

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.280
That's the Hidden Leaf's!

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.700
It must be new intel!

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.160
Retrieve it!

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.080
The X marks the enemy's hideout.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.620
It's known as the Mountain Graveyard.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.660
If we go by land, we'll pass through

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.530
the Hidden Steam Village and the Hidden Frost Village.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.620
Advise both nations that possess the Steam and the Frost villages to evacuate!

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.870
According to reports by the Infiltration and Recon Unit,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.700
the enemy is roughly 100,000 strong.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.370
When one considers mobilizing a regiment of that size,

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.410
I think only a fraction of them will come by sea.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.490
We'll be in a bind if they surround us.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.120
Then it'll all comes down to who makes the first move!

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.240
Convene the Ambush Unit immediately!

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:33.160
Have the main regiment run through their formations!

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.410
Yes sir!

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.450
Make sure the Medical Unit is well supplied

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.280
with medical ninja tools!

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.870
Shikaku, help the Intel Unit check their chain of communication.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.370
Roger.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.200
Contact Ao and the Sensory Unit. Have them hurry!

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.530
Y-Yes.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.200
Tsuchikage, these were finished while you were away.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.280
Oh! So they're done!

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.910
Take it.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.700
SHINOBI Headbands for the Allied Shinobi Forces, eh?

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.780
Nice work!

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.200
I came up with the design.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.120
Former enemies who once battled each other

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.330
are now one shinobi force!

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.160
Furthermore, shinobi and samurai have joined together.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.240
The time is near!

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.530
– Next! – Yes!

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.740
I am Kankuro of the Sand,

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.200
appointed captain of the Ambush Unit.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.410
Kankuro, you say?

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.950
What should be your nickname?

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.780
Huh?!

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.950
Is that wise?

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.660
Naming someone so young the captain...

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.280
What if...what if...

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.200
Because of his inexperience, he messes up and panics

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.700
and forces me to become the acting captain…

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.990
Oh man, what'll I do?!

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.780
The headbands have been distributed!

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.240
Medical supplies have been checked!

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.740
Provisions have been checked!

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.700
Who is in charge of the livestock?!

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.620
A pig's escaped!

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.160
The Captain is here! Everyone, fall in!

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.030
My name is Shizune and I have been named to lead this unit.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.080
Good to meet you all.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.240
First, there is something I want all of you to remember.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.580
This one is not food!

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.660
You're Inoichi, right?

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.370
And you are?

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.580
I'm Tenga! I've heard so much about you!

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.160
Please let me put you on videotape and...

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.280
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.410
I heard... What a rough time you had, Aoba.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.080
Yes, Yamato was...

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.620
But put that out of your mind now.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.700
We, the Intel Unit, will oversee

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.530
all communication between units.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.240
Intel must be transmitted accurately and quickly!

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.450
In order to do that, we must maintain calm at all times,

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.370
no matter what we hear!

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.280
Understand?!

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:36.370
– Yes! – Yes!

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.240
A war, huh?

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:44.080
Your name was Cee, right? Is this your first war?!

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.370
Yes...

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.950
We are the "eyes" of the Allied Shinobi Force.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.370
Our unit's performance can greatly change the tide of battle.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.700
Stay focused and alert.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.240
I understand, Captain Ao!

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.370
Everyone, don't let down your guard!

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.330
– Yes sir! – Yes sir!

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.120
I heard they were going to split us up into five units.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
So I figured they'd group us by village.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.410
That's not going to happen. This is a war.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.240
He's right.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.490
This is no time to be competing with other villages!

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.160
Yeah...

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.240
The main regiment is made up of five units,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.280
each specializing in warfare.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.830
The First Company: Mid-Range Battle Unit

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.030
comprised of shinobi who excel in mid-distance combat.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.160
Made up mostly of shinobi who are weapons users.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.370
The Second Company: Close-Range Battle Unit

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.080
specializes in close combat.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.200
The shinobi of this unit will be fighting on the front lines.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.370
The Third Company: Intermediate-Range Battle Unit

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.910
will be stationed to provide support up close and at mid-range.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.450
To be part of this unit, one must have speed and physical strength.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.240
This is the Fourth Company: Long-Range Battle Unit.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.870
We will provide the link with the Intel Unit to support the front lines.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.240
In addition, we must act as the shield

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.830
for the support units behind the lines.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.120
And finally, the Fifth Company: Special-Range Battle Unit

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.370
with their specialized ninjutsu and attack tactics!

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.490
A Special Unit?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.830
Yes... In war, anything can happen.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.450
Even if we're broken up into units,

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.660
it's wishful thinking to believe that

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.370
each team will operate without a hitch.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.530
Depending on the situation, some units will find themselves in good battlefield position,

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.330
while others will be at a disadvantage.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.370
This is where we'll rely on the shinobi

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.240
who possess secret ninjutsu.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.700
Can't say that all preparations have been made,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.080
but considering roughly 80,000 shinobi have been organized

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.660
into units this quickly...

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.370
You've got to hand it to the brains behind the Hidden Leaf, Shikaku Nara.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.200
You'd better not embarrass your dad.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.330
So the war is about to begin.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.700
Captains!

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.660
The captain of the First Company,

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.910
known as the Raikage's right-hand man,

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.370
Darui of the Hidden Cloud.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.280
The captain of the Second Company, Kitsuchi of the Hidden Rock.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.280
The captain of The Third Company is Kakashi.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.830
The captain of The Fifth Company is General Mifune

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.030
of the Land of Iron.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.120
And… the captain of our Fourth Company,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.280
and the Commander-in-Chief of all the battle units...

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.200
Gaara the Kazekage.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.530
It's time.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.990
Summoning! Reanimation!

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.200
First, the former members of the Akatsuki...

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:19.240
Itachi, Sasori, Deidara, Kakuzu and Nagato.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.240
Then the former Jinchuriki...

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.780
Yugito the Two Tails, Yagura the Three Tails,

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.200
Roshi the Four Tails, Han the Five Tails,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.030
Utakata the Six Tails and Fuu the Seven Tails.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.740
And the former Five Kage...

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.530
The Second Tsuchikage, the Third Raikage, the Fourth Kazekage...

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.330
And Explosion Style Gari, the Demon of the Mist, Zabuza...

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:47.240
Ice Style Haku, Hanzo of the Salamander...

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.830
Granny Chiyo of the Sand, Kimimaro of the Kaguya Clan...

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.410
And from the Hidden Leaf... Asuma Sarutobi, Dan, Hizashi Hyuga...

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.410
and a host of others who had some skill.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.450
And that's not all.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.580
I used Yamato who has cells from Hashirama.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.410
He adapted quite nicely.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:20.370
100,000 White Zetsu empowered by the best ninja of all time.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.280
Magnificent!

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.330
Let's go.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.580
The Fourth Great Ninja War...

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.200
Begins!

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.660
That look in his eyes...

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.410
It's the same look that everyone gives me.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:21.400
No, it's stronger than that, but it's not for me.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.030
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Meeting"

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.370
He pisses me off!

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:34.580
MEETING

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.660
ROCK LEE'S SILLY CHRONICLES PART 5

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.330
My bodysuit shrank!

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.120
I don't have anything to wear today!

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.370
Oh, that's right!

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.030
Using a breathing technique passed down through the ages,

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.450
I can control the elasticity of my muscles!

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.700
All right!

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:00.120
– Fight! Fight! Fight! – Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.010
AAHHHH!

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.160
Tune in again!
