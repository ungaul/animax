WEBVTT

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.870
Who would have thought that both you and I would die so early?

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.470
Although not as early as your mother.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.930
Father, I've always wanted to ask you something.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.630
Why did someone like you, who was known as the White Fang of the Leaf

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.200
choose to ignore the village code

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.830
and abandon a crucial mission in order to save his comrades?

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.300
If you had not done so,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.570
no one would have condemned you and you wouldn't have become so miserable.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.900
I felt so bitter.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.570
I see... You took it pretty hard, didn't you?

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.530
Yeah.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.400
But you know, Father...

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.200
Whatever the outcome, I know you did your best.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.270
I can see that now and I understand you.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.070
You broke the code to save everyone. And I'm proud of you for it.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.870
Thank you.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.630
What is that?!

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.330
What is that light?!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.130
Ma? Where am I?

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.130
- Whoa! - What's going on, Guy Sensei?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.870
I see!

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.130
Lord Fukasaku was definitely dead!

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.670
And yet... What just happened?!

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.600
I-Impossible! How can such a thing occur?!

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.700
What's going on?

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.330
Iruka Sensei!

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.500
- You're alive! - You too, Sensei!

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.900
Ebisu Sensei, are you hurt?

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.000
This is nothing.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.530
Konohamaru saved me.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.700
But never mind my injury. What is this phenomenon?

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.130
Yes...

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.970
What in the world?!

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.030
It seems Naruto has settled things.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.990
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.080
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.500
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.420
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.220
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.520
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.730
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.360
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:41.990
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.990
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.160
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.380
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.880
koete Someday...

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.150
Hero of the Hidden Leaf

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.380
What? What just happened?!

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.550
The villagers are coming back to life, one after another.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.750
What?! You mean...

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.150
I'll stay here and look after them for a while.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.710
Just until they can take better care of themselves.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.410
It's the least I can do.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.850
I'm still in time to revive those I've killed since arriving in the Leaf Village.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.810
It's the least I can do for them.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.350
What's this?

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.680
Seems it was too soon for you to come here.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.410
There must be something you're still meant to do.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.350
Father... I'm glad we got to talk.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.250
Thank you for forgiving me.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.810
Now I can move on in peace.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.650
I'll finally be able to see your mother.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.180
- Pa! - Yes.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.650
Kakashi too, eh?

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.180
What's going on?

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.350
Thank goodness! I'm so glad, Kakashi Sensei!

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.580
I will explain everything.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.650
You...

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:22.480
War inflicts death, injury, and pain to both sides.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.910
The death of someone dear is hard to accept.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.610
We convince ourselves there's no way they could die.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.380
It especially can't be helped with your generation.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.650
You don't know war.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:47.180
You may try to find meaning in death, but there is only pain.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.010
An unbearable hatred...

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.880
Senseless deaths...

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.850
Eternal hatred... And pain that does not heal.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.380
That's what war is.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:08.480
Naruto... This is what you will be facing in time.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.050
Regarding that book, and you...

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.210
It feels like someone set it up.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:25.050
Or... Perhaps this is the real work of a god.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.610
It seems my work ends here, Naruto.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.580
I believe you can bring true peace.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.710
You're taking this one with you too?

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:18.180
Yes... Tendo Pain was created from Yahiko's body.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.210
He is very precious to us.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.350
So he was...Yahiko.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.750
So what are you going to do?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.210
I hate to think that you're returning to the Akatsuki.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.050
I'm leaving the Akatsuki.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.210
Yahiko and Nagato meant everything to me.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.110
Yahiko's dream...

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.250
And Nagato's dream...

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.680
If both of their dreams have been passed on to you,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.310
then you now embody their dreams.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.380
Nagato put his faith in you. So will I.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.080
We, the Hidden Rain, will pursue their dreams with you.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:19.310
If I can't find the answer, perhaps I'll entrust you to find it!

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:25.380
I think I shall believe in you... Naruto Uzumaki.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:38.750
The name Naruto, the guts to never give up, and pain.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.510
That's what I inherited from my teacher and sibling disciple!

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.610
This time...

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.550
I pray that you will be the blossom of hope that never wilts.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.510
Just you watch, Master!

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.950
MASTER TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.810
Good job.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.850
Kakashi Sensei... Just lean on me.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.350
He's gotten heavy.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.210
Hmm?

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.680
Welcome back!

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.510
We knew you could do it!

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.250
They've all been awaiting your return.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.950
My dream is to surpass the Hokage!

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.810
And make everyone in the village acknowledge me!

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.110
Naruto... You did well.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.010
Welcome back!

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.310
Naruto!

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.580
Wh-What's going on?

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:34.280
I relayed every detail of the events that occurred.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.910
Hey! What was the enemy like?

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.550
Are you hurt?

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.110
Oww! Don't push!

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.580
I'm so glad, Naruto.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.310
Hey! Cut it out!

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:02.080
Sakura... You're so reckless, you idiot!

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.080
Thank you.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.650
Way to go, Naruto.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.710
Yes! That's what youth is!

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.480
I can't believe he pulled it off all by himself.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.980
Uh-huh... I could almost fall for him.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.210
- Huh?! - Huh?!

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.650
Ain't he something, that Naruto.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.780
That's my classmate!

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.410
He really outclassed us.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.610
Shut up. We'll make it up starting now!

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.950
Let's join them, Iruka Sensei!

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.850
No, I'm fine right here.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.310
- But... - Now, now...

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.950
Naruto is amazing, isn't he?

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:09.610
At first, everyone thought he was such a nuisance, including myself.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.650
We feared his destiny, so we kept him at arm's length

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.080
and didn't bother with him.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.080
That fox kid shouldn't become a ninja!

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.680
What is the Third Hokage thinking?!

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.650
That Team Kakashi...

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.980
I heard they defeated the terrorist Zabuza!

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.950
Sounds like the Nine-Tails kid had a part in it...

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.110
No way... I heard he was a loser.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.380
I bet it was Kakashi's doing.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.880
I hear that Nine-Tails kid made it to the Finals of the Chunin Exam.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.580
Are you serious?! He's more skilled than I thought.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.310
Humph! I just hope the fox demon doesn't go on a rampage.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.980
Oh!

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.180
That's that fox kid?

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.110
I can't believe he won against a Hyuga.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.710
That was an awesome match!

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:17.050
I never expected such a battle from the fox kid.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.050
He's quite a boy.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.610
However, he never ever gave up.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.150
And he stayed true to his Ninja Way.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.110
And slowly, but surely we couldn't help but acknowledge him.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.680
D-Da...

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.410
Damn it!

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.680
I heard he protected the village from the Sand Jinchuruki!

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.880
Who did?

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:12.150
Naruto Uzumaki. You know, the one...

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.880
I'm so glad the Fifth Hokage has been decided!

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.710
We can breathe a little easier now.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.710
Thanks to Lord Jiraiya and Naruto!

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.150
Is it true they fought Orochimaru?

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.310
I heard they couldn't bring Sasuke Uchiha back.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:12.280
I hope Naruto isn't too depressed.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:18.210
A group named the Akatsuki is after the Jinchuriki.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.880
Which means Naruto will also be targeted.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.480
Will he be okay?

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.250
Lord Jiraiya will look out for Naruto.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.310
I heard that Naruto rescued the Sand's Kagekaze from the Akatsuki!

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.280
Wouldn't it be great if this results in an alliance between the Leaf and Sand?

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.680
The Akatsuki has killed Lord Jiraiya!

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.480
Is Naruto all right?!

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.380
Naruto has Lord Jiraiya's determination!

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.150
He hasn't lost heart!

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.980
He'll keep on going, like always!

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.950
Today, everyone trusts Naruto implicitly.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.950
They worry about him, have high hopes for him and pray for him.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.910
He truly changed the hearts of many people.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.380
It's because he did his best.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.610
Iruka... Yes, Lord Hokage?

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:34.710
I agree with you to a point, but he is just like you.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.980
He never knew parental love

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.780
and because of that incident, people avoided him.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:46.880
So in order to get attention, he resorted to mischief.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.310
In whatever shape or form,

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.980
he desperately wanted to validate his existence and his worth.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:06.910
The Fourth Hokage wanted the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.980
He placed the seal and died hoping for that.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.980
Third Hokage... Fourth Hokage...

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.910
There is a hero right before our eyes.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:16.350
When the fireworks suddenly explode in the air...
fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.850
I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face...
muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:31.070
sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly...

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:46.920
It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you...
kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:53.300
Because I always remember you, in situations like this...
kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto

00:21:53.660 --> 00:22:00.430
I can't help but think about the times we spent together.
mata omoidashiteshimau yo

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:09.900
I'm ready to forget you...
mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:14.030
It just tears at my heart too much.
konna ni mo kanashikute

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:21.200
I wonder... why did we meet each other?

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:24.960
doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes...

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:33.250
me wo tojireba It's like you are here.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:33.250
ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:40.610
Me, as Naruto's homeroom teacher? Please let me think about this.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.980
As you can see, everyone is troubled by Naruto's mischief.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.310
No one wants to take him.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.410
But sir...

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.810
One cannot become a ninja unless they graduate from the academy!

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.310
If Naruto cannot get a teacher,

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.080
then I have no choice but to have him leave the academy.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:00.850
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Rookie Instructor Iruka"

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.080
That child, of all things.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.050
Tune in again!
