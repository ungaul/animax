WEBVTT

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.530
What is that? What is going on?!

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.400
Naruto is fighting Pain right now!

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:13.800
Naruto?!

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.700
Fighting?! By himself?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.000
Yes. We are told not to interfere.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.730
Then all we can do is have faith in Naruto.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.970
Naruto...

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.130
There's no mistake! It's definitely Naruto!

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.930
He's fighting alone!

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.930
No, Lady Hinata!

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.600
But Naruto is risking his life for our village!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.930
If you enter such a battle, you will only get in his way

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.170
and put him at risk!

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.970
Naruto...

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.910
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.000
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.420
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.340
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.140
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.440
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.650
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.280
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:02.910
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.910
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.080
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:18.300
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.800
koete Someday...

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.400
Nine-Tails, Captured!

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.700
Damn it... He even took out Chief Toad and the others!

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.000
Hey! We must hurry and launch the genjutsu.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.700
Performing a duet before everyone is so embarrassing.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.900
Quit complaining and do it!

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.470
I know already!

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.230
This genjutsu requires an enormous amount of Sage Jutsu Chakra.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.970
In other words,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.570
it will take a little time before the jutsu activates.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.830
I'm gonna go for that five-second interval!

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.870
As soon as you take in enough Sage Jutsu Chakra,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.030
start the genjutsu!

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.130
Remember... You only have one Shadow Clone left

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.370
to take in Sage Jutsu Chakra for you, Naruto-boy.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.430
Once that's gone, it'll be impossible to fight

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.070
while taking in Sage Jutsu Chakra, as it requires you not to move.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.600
And your Sage Mode will run out in five minutes.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.200
Using Shadow Clones to help you maintain stillness

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.430
and take in Sage Jutsu Chakra was a good idea.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.770
But why didn't you make more of them?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.330
It's like trying to look to the right and to the left at the same time.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.530
We've divided the task,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.670
but taking in Sage Jutsu Chakra is extremely difficult.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.230
At Naruto-boy's current level, two Shadow Clones was his limit.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.130
On top of that, I can only produce three Shadow Clones for battle.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.870
Any more would interfere with those taking in Sage Jutsu Chakra.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.730
I see... Either way, prolonging things isn't to our advantage.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.500
You are strong indeed.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.170
This is the farthest Pain has ever been pushed.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.130
However... Universal Pull.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.900
That's enough.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.200
Forgive us, Naruto-boy! Just hang in there!

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.770
Naruto...

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.830
Don't worry. I won't kill you.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.670
You are a precious Jinchuriki.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.400
Hah, it doesn't hurt at all!

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.600
Don't underestimate my Sage Mode!

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.600
Now it's my turn to...

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.070
You are right. That is a problem.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.030
What's happening? I'm losing power...

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.930
I get it! This guy is sucking out my Sage Jutsu Chakra!

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.070
Capture of the Nine-Tails, accomplished.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.670
Just a bit longer and we'll be able to use genjutsu.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.430
Hang in there, Naruto-boy!

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.170
You don't have me...yet.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.030
Quite tenacious, aren't you?

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.930
So that's how it is.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.500
Well, it's just perfect since I can't move.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.500
So you've finally resigned yourself.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.000
You know, Nature Energy is really hard to control.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.870
What is this?

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.900
I see... That Pain underwent a petrified frog transformation

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.700
from absorbing too much of Naruto-boy's Sage Jutsu Chakra!

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.300
Sage Jutsu Chakra has its risks, after all.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.270
Now, it's just you...

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.830
Well...not quite.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.270
What do you mean?

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.730
These Pains are puppets.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.300
There is another manipulating these Pains.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.870
The real Pain.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.000
The real Pain?!

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.000
All right, we're ready.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.530
Let's do it, Ma!

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.330
Gotcha!

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.030
Pa!

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.330
Geezer Sage!

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.300
I've had enough of that genjutsu.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.500
Shikamaru!

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.200
Ino! You're alive!

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.370
Yes...

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.330
But...Lady Shizune...

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.870
What?! You mean...

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.630
Aw dammit!

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.630
Oww...!

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.730
Every bone in my body is broken!

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.570
I see... Is that what happened?

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.700
If we had been more diligent, this would never have...

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.930
We can't let Lady Shizune's death be in vain.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.930
We'll unravel the mystery she tried to solve,

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.600
and find the real Pain.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.000
You can whine after all this is over!

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.900
Shikamaru... Can't you say it to her nicer?

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.770
No, he is right, Shikaku.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
The way to make ourselves useful

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.200
is to find the location of the real Pain as soon as possible.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.400
Inoichi, you're a skillful jutsu user.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.970
Are you able to pick up the enemy's chakra

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.430
and trace his whereabouts?

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.130
I already tried.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.070
But the enemy is constantly changing their chakra frequency.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.800
A trace back is impossible.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.030
Pain is quite adept.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.330
Pa!

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.830
Bastard!

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.070
Universal Pull.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.870
Has this tamed you a little, Nine-Tails?

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.400
What are you?!

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.330
Just what do you want?!

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.300
Why are you doing all of this?!

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.070
Why, you ask?

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.730
Things always happen without warning.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.970
And the reason becomes apparent afterwards.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.500
This situation...

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.600
Perhaps I will explain to you.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.600
Use Katsuyu as a medium and gather every piece of data available

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.500
from those who have encountered Pain.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.630
The dead may have left some information as well.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.970
Even if we have to haul dead bodies, find out all we can!

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.530
Haul dead bodies...

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:19.000
Wait... I think I know where to find the real Pain!

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.370
What do you mean?

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.200
Did you figure something out?

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.470
Yeah...

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:28.000
Back when I looked into the mind of the Hidden Rain ninja

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.100
who was captured by Lord Jiraiya...

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.430
His duty was to deliver bodies with his partner.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.030
It's a knack I got from years of experience.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.230
This one's a woman.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:47.030
The highest tower in the village where we always deliver these bodies...

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.730
Deliver bodies?

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.930
Yes... Your earlier remark triggered my memory.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.130
Now listen...

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.600
First of all, it's basic knowledge that one who transmits chakra signals

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.300
must be as close to the receiver as possible.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:01.500
And...

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.330
Of the several towers that exist in Hidden Rain Village,

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.770
this man was delivering bodies to the tallest tower.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.700
It was rumored in Hidden Rain Village

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.070
that Pain could be found in the tallest tower.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:20.830
Actually... Rumor has it that Lord Pain lives up there.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.270
And the woman who appeared as Pain...

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.870
She was the same body as the woman

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.200
who was delivered to the tallest tower.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.330
So this tower was the laboratory where those black rod-like Chakra Receivers

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.470
were implanted into corpses to create the Pains.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.570
And how is that connected to the real Pain's whereabouts?

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.500
The best spot to send out chakra signals...

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:56.000
It had to be the tallest tower with the widest and farthest reach.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.670
I see... That means...

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:05.100
the real Pain is in the highest spot close to Leaf Village.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.870
All right! So we'll search every single spot

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.400
that is at a high altitude!

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:20.230
You asked me why I am doing all of this.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.130
Even if I told you why, I doubt that would change anything.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.270
But what if we tried to have a discussion once more?

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.670
I have nothing to discuss with you.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:38.100
My goal is something even Jiraiya Sensei was unable to achieve.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.870
As I mentioned earlier...

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.500
Creating peace, and bringing about justice.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.730
Peace? Justice?

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:50.170
Yeah, right...

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.100
Don't give me that crap!

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.970
My master! My sensei!

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.130
My friends! My village!

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.970
After everything you've done,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.670
don't you dare talk about peace and justice!

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.970
Then tell me what your goal is?

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.670
I'm gonna kill you!

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.400
And bring peace back to the Ninja World!

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.630
I see... That is noble of you.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.830
That is justice indeed. However...

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.100
My family...

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.270
My friends...

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.230
My village...

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.930
They suffered the same fate as this village,

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.770
by you Hidden Leaf Ninjas.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.100
How is it fair to only allow you people to preach about peace and justice?

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.270
What are you talking about?!

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.170
The Land of Fire and the Hidden Leaf had grown too big.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.530
To protect its national interests,

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.400
it forced feudal clans to wage war against each other,

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.230
and profited from it.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.330
Otherwise, the nation and the people of the villages would have starved.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.670
However, our little nation and its villages became the battlefields

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.570
for the Great Nation's war.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.800
And each time, our nation was ravaged and laid to waste.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.900
After all the fighting subsided,

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.530
things stabilized in the Great Nation.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.630
And our little nation was left to suffer the pain and misery.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.570
You and I seek the same thing.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.300
We are trying to establish the peace that Jiraiya Sensei so desired.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.700
You and I are not different at all.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.770
We each act according to our own sense of justice.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.670
The justice I delivered to the Leaf Village

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.930
is no different from what you are trying to do to me.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.630
The pain of losing something dear to you is the same.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.230
And both of us know that pain all too well.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.800
You have your justice...

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.230
And I have mine.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.600
We are both ordinary men,

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.070
driven to seek vengeance under the banner of justice.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.070
However, if there is justice in vengeance,

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.000
then justice will only breed more vengeance.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.730
And trigger a cycle of hatred.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.000
We are living in the middle of such a phenomenon right now.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.670
We know what the past has been and

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.100
we can predict what the future will be.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.170
That is history as we know it.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.130
So we cannot help but believe that

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.230
human beings are incapable of understanding each other.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:54.470
The world of the ninja is ruled by hatred.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.400
However...

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:07.700
even I can see there's too much hate in our Ninja World.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.770
Hate?

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.370
And I've wanted to do something about this hatred,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.600
yet I'm not sure what must be done.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.100
But I have faith that there will come a time

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.900
when people can truly understand one another.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.430
It all sounds kinda complicated.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:34.770
And if I can't find the answer, perhaps I will entrust you to find it.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.700
Yes, sir! I can't turn you down, can I, Pervy Sage?

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:47.470
How would you confront this hatred, in order to create peace?

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.730
I want to hear your answer.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.670
I don't have an answer...

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.500
to something like that.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:21.270
I formed the Akatsuki in order to stop this cycle of hatred.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.300
I can put an end to it.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.070
For that...I need the power of your Nine-Tails.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.330
I will use the power of every Tailed Beast

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.400
to create a Tailed Beast Weapon,

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.830
many times more potent than the power that destroyed this village.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.830
A power enough to wipe out an entire nation instantly.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.230
A Tailed Beast Weapon?!

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.730
The world will know real pain.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.500
The fear instilled by that pain would prevent wars.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.000
And the world will be on the road to stability and peace.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.970
But that kind of peace...

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.300
It's nothing but a fake!

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.570
Humans are not the most intelligent of creatures.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.830
This is the only way that peace can be achieved.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.270
And after several decades,

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.700
that pain too will eventually fade with time.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.730
It will no longer be a deterrent

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.000
and humanity will begin to battle once more.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:17.930
This time, they themselves will use the Tailed Beast Weapon

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.270
against one another and reconfirm what true pain is.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:26.170
And then peace will be restored again, for a time.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.270
In the course of this endless cycle of hatred...

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.900
Pain will give rise to momentary peace.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:36.730
That is my dream.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.330
Nagato... Try not to push yourself.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.770
You've already spent so much chakra.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.000
Peace is right within our grasp.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.870
I'm here because I want to be.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.900
Always crying... Always giving up before even trying...

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.430
Taking the wrong paths so many times...

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.000
That's who I was.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.330
But your smile is what saved me, Naruto.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.270
That's why I'm not afraid to protect you.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.330
Even if...

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.630
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Confessions"

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.870
I will protect Naruto!

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.030
NARUTO THEATRE

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:10.530
Hinata!

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:11.570
Oh, Sakura.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.570
What's the deal with the new ending?

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.130
Huh? What do you mean?

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.530
How can you oust me, the heroine,

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.770
and have the ending to yourself?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.070
I-I don't know anything about...

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.600
This is what I'm talking about!

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.330
Don't tell me you bribed the staff?

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.100
I-I wouldn't do such a thing!

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.170
And "bicycles"? If you're a ninja, run!

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.070
Give it up, Sakura.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:34.870
Naruto!

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.230
There are fans of Hinata on the staff of Naruto.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.330
I'm told they went out of control this time around.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.700
What's that supposed to mean?!

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.430
And just listen to this song!

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.530
Throughout it they keep repeating "bicycle"!

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.330
Even the brightest animators have no choice

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.600
but to put her on a bicycle!

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.570
Oh, that makes sense...

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.130
That's not the point!

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.670
Hey, staff people! Make an ending credit with me in it!

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.670
You hear me?! Cha!

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:09.030
Tune in again!
