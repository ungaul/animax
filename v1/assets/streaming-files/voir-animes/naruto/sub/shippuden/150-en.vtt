WEBVTT

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.330
High-Level Shinobi

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.700
That Danzo…

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030
He destroyed Shisui's eye before he died.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.070
You've been…

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.770
my goal.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.770
I had nothing, but I built bonds with Team 7.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.230
With you and Sakura.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.270
I'll end it with this!

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.930
What?! He's after Naruto?!

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.200
I have to make it!

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.530
You'll never stop… being a burden.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.170
Sasuke, you…

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.530
Why?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.770
Why did you protect me?

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.030
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.200
You loser.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.400
Why…did you…?

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.900
Mind your own business!

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.830
Like… I care.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.130
I…used to hate you.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.730
Sasuke…

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.330
You better not die.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.600
Sasuke…

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.330
Sasuke!

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.300
Hey!

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.700
Are you hurt, Scaredy Cat?

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.500
Over here!

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.170
You're the one messing up our teamwork!

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.270
You're always showing off!

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.670
Speak for yourself, loser!

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.970
If you don't want to owe me,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.000
you should just become stronger than me.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.830
Hey, are you hurt, Scaredy Cat?

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.270
Here you go! Thanks for waiting!

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.530
Imagine that, the three of you treating me.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.030
I wouldn't be surprised if it snowed.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.530
– It totally worked! – It totally worked!

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.300
Chidori!

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.430
Even if I have to beat you to a pulp and drag you,

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.800
I'll bring you back!

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.800
I wanted to be strong and cool like you.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.370
That's why I kept chasing after you.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.130
I'm really glad I met you.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.170
Naruto…

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.230
You can't change me, no matter what you say to me now.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.700
I'm going to kill each and every person in the Leaf,

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.500
including you!

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.600
And I'll get revenge for the Uchiha Clan!

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.030
Is that really the only way?

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.570
Yes.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.830
So your only choices are to kill me and

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.870
become the hero who saved the village,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.900
or to be killed by me and become known as just a loser!

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.000
Sasuke…

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.830
I don't believe that.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:20.430
I'm not going to be the loser, or the hero who killed you!

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.100
Neither one's gonna happen!

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.200
I…

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.970
Whoa!

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.470
You!

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.400
When did you—?

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.800
I've been tagging along for quite a while.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:09.170
Tobi told me to make sure you didn't notice me.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.600
But, since you were in a crisis…

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.970
I should summon him soon.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.070
It doesn't seem like he's going to retreat quietly.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.430
Naruto… I told you to go back to the village.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.170
Now…

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.870
it's all clear.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.100
I'd better collect the Rinnegan before the war begins.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.200
Sasuke's in a bind. What do you want to do?

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.570
"It's all clear"?

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.030
What do you mean, Naruto?

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.670
What's going on, Sasuke?

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.170
I told you to go home and rest.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.600
Madara…

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.570
The Nine-Tails, huh?

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.670
It seems you cannot suppress the urge to fight

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.870
when you two get together.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:53.170
I'll arrange a proper place for you to hunt the Nine-Tails.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.800
For now, we retreat.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.030
I'll fight in your stead.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.170
Since we need the Nine-Tails Jinchuriki anyway.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.000
Madara as well as Zetsu?

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.170
They're sticking close to Sasuke.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.100
This is going to be tough all by myself.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.130
What should I do?

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.570
Zetsu… You can't capture Naruto.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.600
The Nine-Tails will be too much for a non-combat type like you.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.870
I'm going to let Sasuke get the Nine-Tails.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.330
It's for my enjoyment as well.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.970
Oh, is that so?

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.100
But I'm concerned about Kisame.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.270
So go to him.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.800
And rendezvous with Black Zetsu.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.100
Okay, okay, I understand.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:52.900
Naruto!

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.470
I'm all right.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.030
But I need to make sure I say something to Sasuke.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.330
Let's go, Sasuke.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.400
Wait.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.670
Sasuke… Do you remember?

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.030
Do you remember what you said to me long ago in the Final Valley?

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.170
The thing about high-level shinobi.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.770
When two shinobi are of a high enough level,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.730
they can read each other's thoughts

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.870
through no more than a trade of blows.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.100
They don't need to say a word.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.200
You're naïve, Naruto.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.700
So tell me…

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.530
Were you able to read what was inside of my heart?

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.500
Clashing face-to-face.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.430
Just now, we learned things from just trading blows with each other.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.630
It means we've become high-level shinobi.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.000
You and me.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.930
Sasuke…

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.230
Were you able to read…

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.900
what was inside of my heart?

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.000
And you saw it, didn't you?

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.900
That if you and I fight…

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.500
we will both die.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.900
Sasuke…

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.770
If you attack the Hidden Leaf, I will have to fight you.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.670
Save your hatred until then.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.230
At that time, throw all of your hatred at me.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.830
The only one who can handle all that hatred… is me.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.730
Only I can fulfill that duty!

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.300
And on that day,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.770
I'll bear the burden of your hate and die with you!

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.330
What is it with you, Naruto?

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.930
Just what the hell do you want?!

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.000
Why are you so fixated on me?!

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.800
Because you're my friend!

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.300
Sasuke…

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.230
I knew from the moment we first met that it was going to take more

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.100
than just ordinary means to understand you.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.130
Exchanging fists is how we understand each other.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.570
That's for sure.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.030
Like I said just now…

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.130
It means we've become high-level shinobi.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.900
Once we understand each other, your hatred will go away.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.100
The same way that I changed after meeting Iruka Sensei.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.500
I'm not giving up yet.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.630
I'm taking you back to Hidden Leaf Village!

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.700
That's something I'll never give up on!

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.800
Naruto…you…

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.400
Well, I've rambled on enough.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.830
Damn it.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:32.600
A poor talker like me lecturing you, it's not my style.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.300
If we both end up dying…

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.330
You won't be an Uchiha and I won't be the Nine-Tail's Jinchuriki.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.830
We'll be free of all our burdens.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.870
And we'll finally be able to understand each other in the next world!

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.970
I don't plan on changing.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.400
Nor am I interested in understanding you.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.230
And I don't plan on dying!

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.970
You're the one who's going to die.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.200
If I die, we both die, Sasuke.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.230
Fine then! I'll kill you first.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:43.030
It's clear you still haven't acknowledged me yet.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.170
Enough, Naruto. I'll take Sasuke on.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.870
You have your precious dream of becoming the Hokage.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.930
I can't let Sasuke take you down with him.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.170
How can I become the Hokage

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.600
if I can't even save one friend?!

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.130
I'll fight Sasuke!

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.530
Naruto stands here with clear resolve.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.270
I'll bear the burden of your hate and die with you!

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.700
Compared to him, my resolve is weak.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.330
I'm a shinobi.

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.800
Yet all I do is cry and keep relying on Naruto.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.330
I came here thinking I was past all that.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.000
But I haven't prepared myself for anything.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.100
I can't do a thing.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.630
I can't say anything.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.670
All I can do…

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.430
is trust them!

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.630
All right, Naruto. I'll leave Sasuke to you.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.630
However, Sakura…

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.300
Watch over my body.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.330
I'll get rid of Madara once and for all.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:09.800
Kamui!

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.830
Forget it, Kakashi.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.370
A jutsu like that won't work on me.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.570
Let's go, Sasuke.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:23.370
Madara, I'll talk to you later.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.470
I'll be ready anytime, Sasuke.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.400
What did you want to talk to me about?

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.000
I want Itachi's eyes.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.430
So you finally made up your mind.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.700
You've overused the Susano'o.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.430
I'm aware that you can barely see.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.300
It's perfect timing.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.870
Transplant them right away.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.230
You're in a hurry. What's going on?

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.830
I'm going use every ounce of my strength to crush Naruto!

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.570
I'll eradicate him completely!

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.300
That's all.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.200
Naruto… Thank you, as always!

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.200
Because of you, I can still hope for the day

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.470
that we'll laugh together again as Team 7.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.730
– What?! – Wha—?!

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.270
Naruto!

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.200
A scratch on his cheek. This must be the cause.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.300
Then it's…

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.030
Naruto?!

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.900
Naruto…

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.870
It's from the poison-dipped kunai knife I used earlier.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.130
Seems like it.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.430
You need to administer the antidote right away, Sakura!

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.270
I'm taking you to Hidden Leaf Village.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.800
So please behave yourself.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.900
I wouldn't try anything at this point.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.500
I still feel sick.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.130
A-Are you all right?

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.900
You're gonna throw up!

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.770
– So that's… – Hold on a minute!

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.470
Naruto Uzumaki, huh?

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.470
Are you ready?

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.430
Do it.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.330
Brother…

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.870
I will crush the Hidden Leaf!

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.830
Yo! Long time no see Omoi! Karui!

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.400
Have ya been getting along cheerfully, care-free-ly? Merrily?

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.970
Of course not!

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.570
After you suddenly disappeared from the village like that…

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.000
Now, now! He was safe all this time so it's all okay!

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.870
What's that?

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.370
Just a spoil of war from my battle

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.030
against one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.730
It's taken a liking to me.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.500
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Infiltrator"

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.500
Wow, so this is one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen's blades, huh?

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.270
Tune in again!
