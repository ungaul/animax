WEBVTT

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.430
This isn't the place.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.470
Where are you?

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.330
We've...finally made it this far!

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.670
Sasuke!

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.670
It seems...

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.070
they still haven't been able to find him...

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.530
This hideout is rather large, after all.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.270
I think it'll be a struggle for them.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.630
It'd be a different story if they had a detailed map...

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.670
But unfortunately, it's inside my head.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.100
Did you think if you said that,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.600
I'd ask you to show me the way?

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.170
My mission is to stand guard over you here...

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600
I've no intention of doing something so risky...

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.330
as to take you inside your base.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.370
That's too bad...

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.970
He's not in here, either.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.030
This is the last room on this floor.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.570
Let's go to the next floor.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.330
Right...

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.000
Naruto...!

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.130
We're split up into two search teams.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.970
You should stay calm and rest a little...

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.730
Shut up...!

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.970
I can't be resting!

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.130
We're so close...to Sasuke...

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.470
Damn it...!

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.600
The damage I took when I morphed into the Nine-Tails still hasn't...

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.200
He's not in here, either...

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.330
Sakura... You're getting too impatient...

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.400
This is the inside of Orochimaru's hideout...

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.970
It's possible that traps have been set.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.630
If we get too impatient, he might find out that we're here.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.930
I know that!

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.800
But! Sasuke is...!

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.800
Sakura!

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.770
What about Naruto...?

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.000
Not yet.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.770
But it's only a matter of time before we find Sasuke...

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.370
Act with caution!

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.800
I will...

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.800
The Picture Book's Story 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.300
It seems you're awake...

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.730
Sai?

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.930
Boy...you really resemble him.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.900
My older brother...

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.900
He was talkative and he would lose his head...

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.930
He had no manners... and his equipment was--

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.070
Well, never mind...

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.900
But yeah...like you,

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.130
he went all-out with everything he did.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.700
When I look at you,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.730
I kind of remember him...

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.170
Sai?

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.330
Sai...! Hey, Sai!

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.300
What's the matter?

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.770
I remembered... I remembered...!

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.000
You mean...

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.970
This is what I wanted to show him.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.230
The picture of our dreams...

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.630
Now then...Sai...

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.170
which side are you going to take?

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.470
Striking Shadow Snake!

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.430
Just as I thought. It seems you're taking that side, huh...?

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.270
Sai or whatever...

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.430
I'll stop him here.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.330
Sai, you go find Sasuke.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:02.930
Hurry!

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.370
Okay... I'll find Sasuke... and save him!

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.330
So you came to take back Sasuke, huh...?

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.970
Your persistence is impressive, but will it really be that easy?

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.230
It doesn't make any difference that you're one of the Legendary Sannin

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.430
like the Pervy Sage and Grandma Tsunade!

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.230
I'll defeat you... and take Sasuke back!

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.230
He's not here, either...

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.470
Naruto's Chakra...

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.700
It appears something has happened...

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.030
Let's go!

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:58.470
Right!

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.800
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.300
Striking Shadow Snake!

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.500
Rasengan!

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.870
What happened to all your energy from earlier?

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.330
Your power... The power of the Nine-Tails...

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.730
There must be more to it than this, right?

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.900
You're the one who hurt Sakura, Naruto.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.730
You'll end up tormenting yourself if you rely on the power...

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.870
of the Nine-Tails from here on.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.730
And it could turn into a power that hurts your friends.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.300
Like what happened this time.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.900
If you want to save Sasuke, do it with your own power.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.870
If you want to see Sasuke...

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.970
do it with your own eyes, not the Nine-Tails'.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.730
And if you want to protect Sakura...

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.170
do it with your own power, not the Nine-Tails'!

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.770
Show me all you've got.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.670
Striking Shadow Snake!

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.470
Orochimaru again, huh...?

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.830
Naruto is stalling Orochimaru...

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.130
And I'm sure the Captain and Sakura...

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.130
have gone to back up Naruto...

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.430
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.200
Naruto...

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.330
I'll still let you live...

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.530
Please dispose of as many members of the Akatsuki as you can, okay?

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.800
Wh-What?!

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.470
More importantly, I've got business with Sai...

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.070
So I'll be leaving now.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.130
Where's Sai?

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.800
Sai's looking for Sasuke!

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.630
We have to do something before Orochimaru finds him!

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.630
I'll have to use up all of my Chakra,

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.070
but I'll try searching with my Multiple Shadow Clone...

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.230
Captain Yamato and Sakura, you guys search that side.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.770
What's this...?

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.000
He...was able to remember...

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:58.100
He said that's the picture of dreams he wanted to show his older brother.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.830
They're both smiling...

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:07.430
Yeah... He smiled for real for the first time when he drew that...

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.100
Smiled from the bottom of his heart.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.730
Wh-What's this...?!

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.200
What's the matter?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.770
It was in Sai's bag...

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.200
This is an assassination list that has...

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.200
an Anbu Black Ops member's own targets recorded...

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.770
It's called a Bingo Book.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.430
An assassination list...?

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.530
What are these "X" marks?

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.930
In all likelihood,

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:09.030
they're marks indicating targets that have already been eliminated...

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.930
Why does Sai have such a thing...?

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:31.270
Look at this...

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.670
Th-This is...!

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.500
Why is Sasuke's face... in Sai's assassination list...?

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.530
Why is Sasuke's face on Sai's assassination list...?

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.800
Then Sai's real mission was to assassinate Sasuke?!

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:46.670
It can't be...

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.570
He promised me that he would save Sasuke!

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.600
I'm sorry to say this, but it could all be an act.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:54.230
But...!

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.500
What was that noise?!

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.000
Can it be that Sai...!

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.830
No...!

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.570
Let's hurry! Sai's location is not that far!

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.400
Next time: "Reunion"
