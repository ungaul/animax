WEBVTT

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.520
And now… This world shall know pain.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.520
Almighty Push…

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.120
Wh-What is this?!

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.950
How could this hap—

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.020
Naruto… Hurry!

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.850
Please, Naruto!

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.520
Where are we anyway?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.320
Where is the enemy?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.680
What's going on, Ma?!

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.850
Why didn't you Summon us to the Leaf Village?

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.280
This is the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.550
What do you mean, Granny Shima?!

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.880
Look carefully around you.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.750
It can't be…!

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.080
And it's obvious who did this.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.750
I sense the same energies as when we rode atop Jiraiya-boy’s shoulders.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.020
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.110
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.530
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.450
And yet we're stuck here — unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.250
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.550
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.760
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.390
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:17.020
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.020
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.190
Even in a world without you, we run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.410
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.910
koete Someday...

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.300
Explosion! Sage Mode

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.300
Lady Tsunade, are you all right?!

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.130
Yes…

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.330
Wh-What is this?

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.500
You will not get away with this…

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.900
You will not get away with this, Pain!

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.230
The mark on her forehead is gone!

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.470
She has already released her Mitotic Regeneration Jutsu

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.270
and given all her chakra to Lady Katsuyu.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.400
In order to protect the villagers from this Pain’s jutsu…

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.400
She can no longer…

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.130
Are you all right, Iruka?!

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.070
Forgive me.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.070
It took everything… just to cover you all.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.400
You are not to blame, Lady Katsuyu.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.800
I just hope everyone else is all right.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.070
Lady Shizune…

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.170
Pa!

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.100
Choza is all right.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:12.870
Thank goodness.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.830
Kakashi Sensei…

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.100
Pa…

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.230
You tried to protect me…

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.230
Save the crying for later…Choji.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.500
If you are able to move…

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.130
report to Lady Tsunade about Pain's abilities.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.800
A counter strategy is imperative!

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:02.830
Kakashi Sensei, your last mission orders… I-I com…

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.670
I completed the mission, Sensei!

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.100
Damn!

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.100
Hang in there, Kiba!

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.730
Ow!

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.170
This is nothing.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.330
Are you all right, Lady Hinata?

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.300
Yes, but Ko, you’re injured.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.230
If anything should happen to you during Lord Hiashi and Lady Hanabi’s absence,

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.270
I will be dishonored for life.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.100
You need not concern yourself with me.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.570
But I must!

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.600
If everyone is injured while the head of the family is away,

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.070
I will be the one scolded.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.130
Lady Hinata…

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.630
Still…this attack is…

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.300
Are you all right, Shikamaru?!

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:27.030
Yeah… But what's going on?!

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.000
You okay, Shikamaru?!

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.730
I made it out, but my leg’s broken.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.530
You should consider yourself lucky

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.770
if the only thing you suffered in this attack was a leg injury.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.830
Actually, Shikamaru…

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.130
shielded me.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.670
And that's how he got hurt.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.730
Come on, this is no time for tears.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:54.900
They possess this kind of jutsu, but didn't use it from the start.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.930
Which means, they had a purpose.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.470
And they fulfilled that purpose,

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:07.700
so they changed from guerilla tactics to an all-out offensive.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.700
Who's "they"?

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.530
Someone who can do this much damage to the Leaf Village…

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.800
The only one I can think of is the Akatsuki.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.730
I agree…and their target is none other than…

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.130
Yeah…

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.200
Naruto Uzumaki!

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.470
N-Naruto?!

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.470
Yes…

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.500
I'll never have enough lives if I rely on luck alone.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.600
Still, I'm one lucky guy.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.930
If you care enough to shed tears,

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.570
then pray we don’t get hit with another one.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.300
Naruto…

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.570
That's…

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.070
It’s Naruto!
Naruto?!

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.070
You saved us the trouble of looking for you.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.370
Why are you being so reckless?

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.470
This is…my justice.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.930
The effectiveness of the jutsu

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:16.700
when all the chakra is concentrated in Tendo is great,

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.170
but it also increases the risks.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.900
Not only that, the other five are recovering much slower

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.900
compared to the last time this jutsu was used.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.430
From here on out, I'll be looking after you.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.030
No more Paper Clones.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.200
Summoning Jutsu!

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.700
Looks like all six have assembled.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.530
Tsunade?

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.830
I am the Fifth Hokage!

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.800
Lady Hokage!

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.600
You trampled on the jewel, the dreams of my predecessors.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.300
I will not forgive you!

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.730
I will settle this now as the Hokage!

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.600
It appears you now understand a little about pain.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.330
However…my business is not with you.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.430
My business is…

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.730
With me!

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.800
There’s no need for the Leaf’s Hokage

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.600
to bother herself with the likes of them.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.970
You just sit back and sip some tea, Granny.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.230
Naruto!

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.300
What happened?! I can’t tell from here.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.800
It was amazing! He took down one of the Pains in one swoop.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.030
Naruto…you…

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.070
Gramps… Doesn’t he remind you of those two?

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.000
You’re right…

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.770
It seems Naruto-boy has surpassed his predecessors.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.000
Naruto Uzumaki.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.330
Let’s settle this!

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.770
Tendo’s power won’t return for quite some time.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.070
In which case…

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.670
Gamakichi!

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.270
Take Granny Tsunade to someplace safe!

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.530
Gotcha!

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.930
Granny, I’ll take over from here!

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.630
Tell everyone in the village to stay out of the way!

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.600
It’ll be difficult to fight while trying to cover for them.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.730
Understood.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.730
But take Katsuyu. I know she'll be useful to you.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.800
She has intel on them.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.830
Katsuyu-girl… Keep yourself hidden in Naruto-boy's clothes.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.100
Yes, sir.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.630
Now may not be the right time to ask a question like this…

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.170
But now that I've mastered Nature Energy…

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.170
I'm able to sense everyone's chakra.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.530
Is Kakashi Sensei on a mission away from the village?

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.670
I see…

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.400
Go, Gamakichi!

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.200
Summoning Jutsu.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.500
Master!

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.530
Lady Tsunade!

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.800
Sakura…

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.800
Everything is okay now.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.700
Yes…

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.570
Thank you, Lady Tsunade.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.470
Summoning Jutsu!

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.570
– Sage Art! Frog Song! – Sage Art! Frog Song!

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.500
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.230
– Sage Art! Giant Rasengan! – Sage Art! Giant Rasengan!

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.370
Bunta-boy! Ken-boy! Hiro-boy!

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:46.870
Right on!

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.800
Naruto! Ninjutsu won't work on the Pain standing before you.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.470
He will absorb all your ninjutsu attacks.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.170
Then we'll go with Frog Kumite!

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.630
All the Pains are visually linked!

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.170
A blind-spot attack is meaningless

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.070
unless you move out of the line of view of every one of them.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.170
Well then… I'll show them an attack they can't see.

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.230
You little mutt!

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.530
Take that!

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.070
Down with you!

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.330
He's falling.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.270
You see, I’m ungraceful.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.200
Stay still, you mutt!

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.030
I thought we dodged it…

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:14.000
Frog Kumite utilizes the Nature Energy around you.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:19.330
The energy became part of Naruto's body when he attacked Pain!

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.300
In Sage Mode, both threat perception and attack range

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.330
are enhanced way beyond the ordinary.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.670
No time to waste here!

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.730
I’ll finish this with my new jutsu!

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.400
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.630
I see… So you have become a Sage…

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.000
mastering the same jutsu as Jiraiya Sensei.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.070
Jiraiya…“Sensei”?

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.470
I also learned jutsu from Jiraiya.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.200
He was once my master…

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.370
Which would make us sibling disciples.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.770
Sharing the same master,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.630
you and I should be able to understand one another.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.570
Our master desired peace.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.530
Shut the hell up!

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.770
Such massive chakra… Did you teach him that, Pa?

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.970
No… I'm seeing it for the first time too.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.270
He never showed that during our training.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.000
What is Naruto-boy planning to do?

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.300
What is that jutsu?

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.430
What is it?

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.800
Naruto's chakra is forming into… Yes, almost like a shuriken.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.970
Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken?!

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.200
Naruto!

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.100
All that you've done here…

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.070
Where's the "peace" in that?!

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.200
You're only looking at the tree, not the whole forest.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:44.200
You don't know the true meaning of peace.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.200
So let yourself be captured.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.230
Your death will lead to peace.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.730
I told you… to shut the hell up!

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.700
He threw it!

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:00.330
What is that?!

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.470
Pa! The boy’s no longer in Sage Mode.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.330
It’s risky, but we must merge with him now!

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.670
We can’t! You see, the Nine-Tails prevents us from merging!

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.530
Then what are we going to do?!

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.700
Naruto-boy came up with a way only he can pull off!

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.630
And that’s what we’re about to do!

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.530
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: “Danger! Sage Mode Limit Reached”

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.230
I’m counting on you, Geezer Sage!

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:10.430
Man… Who’d have thought you'd master Wind Style?

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.330
What makes you say that?

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.970
I was just thinking…

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.900
Yeah, who would have guessed back then?

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:19.300
Huh?

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.500
The Wind Style?

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.900
It has a nice ring to it, y'know.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.770
All right! I'm absolutely gonna master it.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.230
Yeah right. You can't even clone yourself yet.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.430
Shut up!

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.230
Damn it!

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.230
Actually, I can use it.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.400
Watch me.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.330
Here I go!

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.400
Wind Style! Great Suction!

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:48.670
See?

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.270
What kind of Wind Style is that?!

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.930
Even I can do that.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.100
Here I go!

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.500
Wind Style! Fart!

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.530
You idiot!

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.230
Why?

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.300
Idiot, idiot, you’re an idiot!

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.130
Tune in again!
