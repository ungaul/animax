00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.230
The Complete Ino-Shika-Cho Formation

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.070
I am not… I am not fat. The Complete Ino-Shika-Cho Formation

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.400
I'm just pleasingly plump!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.440
Why?

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.190
It's no good.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.610
Choji has totally lost his will to fight.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.480
Why, Choji?!

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.400
It didn't work!

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.440
Choji! Move away!

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.440
Choji!

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.230
Ino Mind Transferred into Choji.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.110
That was close!

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.360
Thanks for the Shadow Possession, Shikamaru!

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.440
Ino…

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.480
We went on many missions with Asuma Sensei as Team 10.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.610
I know exactly how you feel.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.530
Shikamaru and I don't want to fight him either.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.400
But because we know Asuma Sensei better than anyone else,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.730
we can stop him with the least amount of risk to the Allied Force!

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.400
Choji…

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.690
Choji, you haven't forgotten what these piercings represent, have you?!

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.610
Everyone in Team 10 is now a chunin.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.360
That means I'm no longer in charge of you.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.570
Each of you will go on to become captains

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.690
and eventually lead your own teams.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.530
These earrings are a gift to celebrate your promotions.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.400
Don't ever forget that the four of us were members of Team 10!

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.780
And these earrings are proof

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.400
that you have come of age in your respective clans.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.400
Each of you know story behind the Practice of the Piercings.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.610
Now go, and present your earrings to your clans.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.570
And when you do,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.320
you will be officially recognized as full-fledged shinobi!

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.780
Now, get going!

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.530
Full-fledged shinobi…

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.190
I…I…

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.070
Fire Style!

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.570
Burning Ash!

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.070
Ino, Choji!

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.900
Choza!

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.440
Old Man!

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.360
That's right…

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.400
The story about the King…

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.280
I'll tell you who the King is.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.610
Lend me your ear.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.320
The children who will be taking over the future Hidden Leaf Village…

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.570
They are the King.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.190
Kurenai is pregnant with our child.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.400
I entrust…my "King" to all of you.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.610
Choji!! Snap out of it!

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.860
We're not brats who need to be protected!

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.820
We're the ones doing the protecting!

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.530
Would you let Asuma kill his own child?!

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.400
Your idea of kindness is wrong here!

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.440
Shikamaru is right!

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.360
Why do you think you have that piercing?

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.280
Quit pouting, Choji!

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.530
You're the 16th head of the Akimichi Clan!

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.570
Akimichi Clan…

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.690
Um…um…

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.320
Of those three symbols,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.530
the one of the right belongs to the Akimichi Clan, right?

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.480
The rest are…um…

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.980
The one in the middle signifies the Nara Clan.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.190
The one on the left is the Yamanaka Clan.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.610
Three clans that use highly unusual Secret Ninjutsu.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.110
We've been combining our powers for many generations

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.190
and the three clans share a special relationship.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.150
To strengthen unity and protect our clans,

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.400
the authoritative Sarutobi Clan bestows ear piercings

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.530
upon all three of our clans.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.400
Generation upon generation has sworn the oath of loyalty

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.400
on these earrings.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.230
This is it, right?

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.440
The other clan heads wear one too.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.110
Piercing your ear must hurt though.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.650
The ear is pierced, so that the message goes deep down.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.530
So that one never forgets the oath.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.360
In time, you will pierce your ear too.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.530
What?! Why?

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.320
When a child becomes a genin,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.480
it is customary for the parent to pass on his earring to the child

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.400
until he attains chunin rank.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.440
It's a practice to teach one's child about one's oaths!

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.320
I don't like pain.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.860
Choji…

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.300
I wonder if he's going to be okay…

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.010
He's a coward.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:49.260
He finally became a genin, but he doesn't like confrontation.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.010
He'll soon go out on missions

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.800
and may have to face foes in life-or-death battles.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.880
As it is…

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.180
As it is, Choji will be killed because he was too scared to make a move.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.550
I doubt if he'll ever become a chunin.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.510
Your son is not a coward. He's just kind.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.470
In the shinobi world, it's the same thing.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.970
Then let him be kind.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.300
"Be kind"?

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.300
Yes. His kindness is a unique weapon

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.300
which he, and only he, possesses.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.630
Weapon…

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.840
He's just a boy.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.510
It can't be helped if it's viewed as cowardice.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.760
But some day, his kindness will be a thing of greatness.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.550
The time will come when the Hidden Leaf will need his kindness.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.300
However, he will require strength that rivals his kindness.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.880
He needs the intensity to recognize others' pain,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.180
to feel and accept their pain…

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.430
Or reject it…but still envelope them in kindness.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.720
That boy has those qualities.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.340
Asuma…

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.970
Choji will experience many things.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.510
This is the shinobi world, the hardships will be many.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.970
But with each experience, he will grow stronger and kinder.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.050
Choza! Please come quickly!

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.970
Sorry, I'll be right there!

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.760
If you are truly kind…

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.340
there is no other time like now.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.840
Or are you merely a coward?

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.510
Choji! It's all right!

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.510
You are kind.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:33.340
But must this butterfly learn to live… by borrowing strength from you?

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.840
From today on, you are an adult.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.050
You will have a new piercing upon which you make your vow…

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.470
and it will be your turn to nurture your own child

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.300
and pass on that earring.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.970
What is it?

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.180
Do you think… I can really get married?

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.300
What kind of look is that, Choji?!

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.880
You know what it is, right?

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.180
When Asuma always tells you that you lack something.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.930
Even I was able to get married.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.720
Have more confidence in yourself!

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.880
But I might not be as lucky as you.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.300
Times are different…

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.340
And it's hard to find girls who are interested.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.840
Choji, the time has come to make your oath!

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.340
You know the words, don't you?

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.800
Uh-huh…

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.300
Human Boulder!

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.380
I won't hand over this last bite to anyone!

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.880
With an appetite like that,

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.300
there's no need to worry about your body.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.720
After I finish eating, can you help me train, Asuma Sensei?!

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:27.550
Lastly, Ino, Choji, Shikamaru…

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.470
There's something I want to say.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.180
Choji…

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.380
You are kind and considerate of your comrades.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.340
That is why you will be stronger than any other shinobi.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.430
Have more confidence in yourself.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.010
Okay.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:55.260
And…you should diet a little.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.550
I don't know if it'll work, but I'll try my best.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.340
I just thought that I'd change naturally.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.380
I thought both my heart and body would get stronger when I got older.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.050
So the war's about to begin.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.840
We have to fight dead people?

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.340
What do I do? I'm getting scared.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.430
Hey Choji…

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.300
It's too late to whine, now that you're here.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.630
U-Uh-huh…

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.340
I feel a little scared.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.970
Hey, you guys… Don't chicken out on me.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.590
This is too much for me!

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.300
I can't take our Sensei down!

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.340
Now, Choji!

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.220
I know you are kind.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.470
But right now, taking me down is kindness!

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.550
This is the time to transform your kindness into strength!

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.590
This is the time, Choji!

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.760
I thought that oath was just part of a ritual.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.470
I hereby swear as the 16th head of the Akimichi Clan,

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.880
I shall pass on this oath entrusted to me by the 15th head,

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:27.340
unto the 17th. To my child that is to be!

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.630
Sorry, Ino.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.380
I'm okay now. You can switch back.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.430
In order to protect the Yamanaka and Nara Clan,

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.930
and the Hidden Leaf Village…

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.220
I, Choji Akimichi, swear to transform from a caterpillar…

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.930
Into a butterfly, and take flight!

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.550
Choji!

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.760
It's time to change!

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.930
So you grew wings, Choji… without using your pills!

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.010
Choji!

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.510
That's my boy, Choji.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.300
Yes! That's the look!

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.630
Choji's skinnier!

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.430
Did he take that pill he took long ago?

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.130
This looks like the effects of the Chili Pepper Pill.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.340
Will he be all right?

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.970
He'll be fine!

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.930
He didn't use the Akimichi Clan's Secret Calorie Control Technique.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.630
He transformed on his own.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.880
In other words, he'll have no side effects from the pill.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:57.130
Was the shell of the chrysalis harder than you thought, Choji?

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.840
Well, you can fly now, right?

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.050
Oh yeah!

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.090
I'm going up!

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.930
Old man Choza!

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.300
I'm sorry Choji's been such trouble!

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.300
But that's all over.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:31.680
He is now worthy of being the 16th head of the Akimichi Clan.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.970
We'll deal with Asuma!

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.090
Please take care of the rest, old man!

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.510
Come get me!

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.470
When you've weakened him, send him over to us!

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.260
You sure can bark out orders.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.010
We should go and help.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.510
Shut up!

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.800
That's the Sealing Corps!

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.300
Like it's that simple!

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.380
Shikamaru! Your back!

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.260
Right!

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.300
Go, Ino!

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.720
Mind Transfer Clone Jutsu!

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.590
I'm up next!

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.130
Shadow Stitching Jutsu!

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.010
There's no way to counter this.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.300
Nice work, Choji!

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.970
Choji… That's the look.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.380
As long as you have that look,

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.880
you will be stronger than any shinobi out there.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.720
Right now, you have the expression

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.590
of someone who has all the confidence he needs!

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.510
Choji!

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.880
To beat me with the memento I left you…

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.300
I can't move because I'm filled with emotion.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.970
I call it my Shadow Possession Shuriken Jutsu.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.010
That's why you can't move.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.050
All right!

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.300
Leave the rest to us, the Sealing Corps!

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.050
Can you wait a bit?

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.380
What?!

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.050
We already heard your last words.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.470
Hearing them a second time won't have the same impact.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:38.630
Then let me add one thing I couldn't tell you the last time.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.630
I have nothing more to say to you three…

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.180
because your Ino-Shika-Cho formation is complete.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.260
Sensei…

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:02.800
Asuma…

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.590
Asuma Sensei…

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.130
– Thank you. – Thank you.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.930
What is that?!

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.050
I'm ending this battle now!

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.510
So help me out, Shikamaru! Ino!

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.260
All right!

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.470
Choji, I've been with you for a long time…

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.680
but I've never seen you take charge!

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.470
Naruto, I'm sorry but I cannot let you pass.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.630
This many guards? Why are you watching me?

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.430
Enough! Just go back inside. I'll tell you there.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.010
Why can't you tell me outside? Why can't I go outside?

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:51.880
Naruto!

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.430
Why are you here?

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.220
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "A Message from the Heart"

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.220
Why? Tell me why? A MESSAGE FROM THE HEART

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.930
A MESSAGE FROM THE HEART

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.340
Tune in again!
