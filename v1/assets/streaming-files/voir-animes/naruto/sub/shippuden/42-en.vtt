00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.230
Simply unbelievable...

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.700
the things this child can do...

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.760
Oh shoot...

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.060
Orochimaru vs. Jinchuriki 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.060
I don't believe this...

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.130
The fourth tail has appeared.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.930
The fourth tail?

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.130
The Chakra leaking out is unstable...

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.230
It's trying to shift even closer to the Nine-Tail form...

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.600
The Nine-Tailed Chakra is different in quality and quantity than any before.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.560
More than anything, it has a strong evil aura.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.960
Besides using Naruto's body as a vehicle...

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.560
That is truly...

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.600
A small Nine-Tail in and of itself!

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.660
Such incredible shockwaves... Just from a swing of his arm, geez!

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.130
At this rate, there's no way I can move closer...

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.630
Was this also Naruto's...?

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.400
That's right.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.330
Captain Yamato...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.130
You know something...

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.800
about Naruto, don't you?

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.930
What in the world happened to Naruto?

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.400
Sakura...you don't need to worry.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.000
It is for that very reason.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.960
and for times like this...

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.130
that I was chosen by my superiors...

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.560
as Team Captain.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.800
Someone overwhelmed with that much Chakra...

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.660
Normally...

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.460
how could he still be moving?

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.660
It seems Sasori won't be coming here, now is he...?

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.560
Kabuto...

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.000
It seems Sasori won't be coming here, now is he...?

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.960
The only person who was supposed to know

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.060
that I was coming here today was Sasori...

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.460
Not even the other Akatsuki members were privy to that information.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.230
But despite that, you Leaf guys are here...

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.630
It would be hard to believe that Sasori...

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.430
would confess under torture...

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.000
Which means that he gave out the information of his own volition.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.060
Most likely, his intention was for you to get information...

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.630
about Orochimaru out of me...

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.460
and then have the Leaf Village dispose of him.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.660
Because Orochimaru has proven to be too tough a customer ...

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.230
for the Akatsuki guys, too.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.060
Your disguise earlier on...

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.330
was perfect...

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.960
If you hadn't pulled out a Kunai Knife,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.230
I wouldn't have been able to get away before I noticed.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:06.100
This kid you sent to me... has come in very handy.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.700
Unless one of you has met directly with Sasori,

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.400
it wouldn't have evolved that way...

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.000
Most likely Sasori gave you the information about today at that time...

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.800
In ten days at midday,

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.330
go to Tenchi Bridge located in the Village Hidden in the Grass.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.160
One of Orochimaru's subordinates is my spy.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:49.430
I was to rendezvous...with him there.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.600
Of course, it was probably based on...

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.630
the assumption that the Jutsu placed on me was still in affect.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.760
The fact that Sasori would go out of his way to do that...

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.660
means that he's acknowledged your strength...

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.800
Sasori holds a grudge against Orochimaru.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.000
He was always saying that he wanted to personally execute Orochimaru...

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.530
But to act against his own will and send you guys here means...

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.630
that he is already in a situation in which he is unable to do that...

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.000
In other words...

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.760
he has either been captured...

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.700
or he is already dead.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.200
Unfortunately it's the latter...

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.400
That's delightful...

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.830
What's this...?

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:53.630
That's...!

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.900
Could that be Chakra?

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.300
That looks like trouble.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.460
Anyone who has Chakra that high in density...

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.530
will most certainly die.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.160
Naruto...

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.400
What the hell are you going to do...?

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.330
With that much high-density Chakra making it difficult...

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.830
for him to even move...

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.230
I wonder how he plans to do battle with me...

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.600
So that's his move!

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.230
Triple Rashomon!

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.660
What an incredible battle!

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.630
Trying to find an opening and fight...

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.230
It doesn't even seem like an option!

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.000
What in the world...?!

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.830
What we saw earlier...

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.660
was definitely Orochimaru's Triple Rashomon...

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.960
And in a split second it got destroyed...

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.800
It's unbelievable that something to this extent could have happened.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.900
He's gotten even closer to the Nine-Tail than earlier on, hasn't he?

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.000
Naruto...

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.470
Take a look at that.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:43.500
It's no longer a battle of Ninja, but a battle of monsters.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.630
Is that how he wanted to rescue Sasuke? By becoming like that?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.870
Naruto!

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.700
He's hardly conscious anymore.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.270
Really, he is such a pitiful child...

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:59.130
That's enough, that's enough, Naruto! I will rescue Sasuke.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.070
Stop! Don't go near him, Sakura.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.070
I'll rescue him... So Naruto, please!

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.330
Next time: "Sakura's Tears"
