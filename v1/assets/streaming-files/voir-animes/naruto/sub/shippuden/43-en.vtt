00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.630
Naruto is over here...

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.470
That thing is not human...

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.400
Sai, what are you doing?

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.370
Got it. Continue to observe.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.370
Sakura!

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.600
That's...Naruto...

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.570
Naruto!

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.600
That's...

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.630
I can't pierce through... even with my snake sword...

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.670
This is what Master Jiraiya was referring to when he said...

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.930
he's "like a small Nine-Tailed Beast."

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.470
Sakura's Tears 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.100
This is not like a Ninja battle,

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.170
but more like a battle between monsters...

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.730
Naruto...

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.730
It's useless to go on fighting with the snake sword...

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.230
What's the situation like? Is Naruto dead?

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.700
Look at that...

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.370
I wonder if he still wants to save Sasuke...

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.830
even in that state.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.070
I am going to take back Sasuke, no matter what!

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.570
It's my lifelong promise!

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.730
Sakura! I...will keep my promise, no matter what!

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.730
To stand firm with what I say... That's my Way of the Ninja...

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.630
By now, even his self-consciousness is gone...

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.770
What a sad kid...

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.430
Wait! Sakura!

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.630
Don't get close to Naruto in that state!

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.400
Naruto!

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:33.370
That's...that's enough! I will save Sasuke, no matter what!

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.000
That's why...

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.530
Naruto, it's enough...!

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:45.730
Not good!

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.900
What is he trying to do?

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.770
Now is my chance...

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.730
Looks like it's about time...

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.430
As expected, this body is rejecting me.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.400
Too bad, but the fun ends here.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:48.630
Patience... Patience now... I have Sasuke with me...

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.930
Oh, uh...

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.630
Damn! I didn't make it in time...

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:32.630
I won't let you step in.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.700
You're rushing to conclusions.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.700
I don't plan to fight you guys anymore.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.400
Actually...it's the opposite.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:44.800
What do you mean?

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.830
We both have the same goal.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.070
The Akatsuki are in the way.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.100
If I let you live...

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:21.700
I think you might just get rid of one more Akatsuki.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.500
Naruto...

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.400
The wounds are healing much slower than I expected...

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.430
but I can't stay playing "volunteer" for long.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.700
Lord Orochimaru is also reaching his limit.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.230
In exchange for helping you...

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.070
please get rid of as many of the Akatsuki as you can...

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.000
That said, that is your teammate...

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.200
Take care of the rest.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.500
It's time to leave, huh?

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.070
Now's the only chance...!

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.730
I am Danzo's man. I am not your enemy...

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.800
I have something to speak to you about.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.670
Hokage Style: Elder Jutsu

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.030
STABILIZE

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.000
10th Edict on Enlightenment!

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.370
Naruto...

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:51.100
Danzo...that doddering old fool is still alive, huh?

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.230
So...

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.430
What do you want to talk about?

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.100
I have a message from Danzo to Lord Orochimaru.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.930
The truth is... Before that...

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.730
Choose your words carefully when you talk to me.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.900
If not, you'll die.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.570
I can only relay what Danzo has told me.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.100
If that does not satisfy you, then I'll leave it up to you...

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.900
Captain, can you teach me the Jutsu you used earlier?

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.230
That is impossible.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.030
Why?

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.870
I am the only person in the Leaf Village who can use that Jutsu...

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.230
because I inherited the First Hokage's cells.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.000
It's always like this... I can only do little things for Naruto.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.430
The size of the things you do, big or small, are not important.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.100
What is important is how you feel about Naruto.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.600
I can tell by just watching. The truth is, you are...

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.270
