WEBVTT

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.170
This is my ultimate art...!

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.230
Now I will detonate myself.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.100
He's...!

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.770
With death, I will become art.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.830
This never-before-seen explosion will leave

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.430
a never-before-seen scar on this land.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.730
And...! My art will win never-before-seen admiration!

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.270
Sorry, Tobi... Hmm?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.430
In the midst of my admiration, you will definitely die!!

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.070
An explosion that will cover a ten-kilometer radius...

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.070
You won't be able to get away!

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.770
Now, tremble with fear!

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.870
Be in awe! Despair!!

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.130
Scream!

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.830
My art is...

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.470
An explosion!!

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.030
Wha--?!

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.370
What is that?!

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.270
What the--?!

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.370
Kakashi, what is that?

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.370
This chakra... It's that Akatsuki member...

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.800
Wh-What could it be?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.330
Let's go check it out!

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.400
Right!

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.700
Look!

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.430
Sasuke... It can't be...!

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.830
I can't sense Sasuke's chakra!

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.870
That's near our rendezvous point...

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.570
Don't tell me he's...!

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.670
Damn! It's just as I feared!

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.170
That Deidara... He blew himself up.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.470
Where's Tobi?

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.170
Probably dead... He was within the blast range...

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.300
Disappearance Deidara is dead.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.400
In the end, he went out with a bang.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.700
Oh dear. Another member has been lost...

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.100
And I thought he was pretty strong.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.870
So? Which one did him in?

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.970
Sasuke? Or the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki?

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.800
It was Sasuke.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.500
However...

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.500
It looks like Sasuke is dead too.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.630
Deidara took Sasuke down with him, huh...?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.470
You should feel grateful, Itachi.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.430
Deidara did you a favor and got rid of your problem.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.600
Hmm... I feel like we've forgotten something...

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.000
Looks like Tobi is dead too.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.370
That Deidara detonated himself without regard for his surroundings.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.070
Ah yes, Tobi.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:53.070
It must've been quite a jutsu if that chicken was unable to escape.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.670
No matter... He can easily be replaced.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.170
The loss of Deidara, however, is unfortunate.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.270
I liked Tobi.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.070
When it came to lightening the mood in our rather gloomy organization,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.030
Tobi was quite talented.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.570
I'm going.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.970
I shall mourn Deidara's death in silence.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.130
Then I'll mourn for Tobi.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.070
You must really be bored, huh?

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.200
When the crest of the snake vanishes...

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.130
Then...I do this...

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.770
Add a drop of Sasuke's blood...

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.570
All right.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.130
Summoning Jutsu!

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.230
S-So, this is Orochimaru's Summoning Jutsu... Manda...

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.830
Even Orochimaru had trouble controlling this guy.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.200
How did Sasuke manage to...?

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.900
I see. He used genjutsu...

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.800
Whoa, you're a mess!

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.770
Who did you fight?

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.730
You...had the nerve...

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.330
to use me... You damned brat...

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.130
Those eyes...you controlled me... with those eyes...

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.530
I...of all...people...

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.800
Oh-ohh, he's dead.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.730
Wasn't Manda Orochimaru's favorite pet?

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.700
You ought to treat animals better...

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.800
And the whole manipulation with the genjutsu...

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:10.200
There wasn't time to think. I had no choice...

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.200
Found you!

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.470
I figured you'd be here!

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.030
Your chakra suddenly disappeared, so I wondered what had happened...

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.600
Did you transport yourself?!

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.400
You hid yourself inside Manda,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.930
then used the Transportation Technique to escape into another dimension...

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.030
So why are you in such bad shape?

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.100
Just before escaping, we both got hit by the blast wave.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.100
My opponent was one of the Akatsuki.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.600
He was stronger than I expected...

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.130
Sasuke all cut up and bruised is also hot...

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.170
In any case, he needs time to rest. Right, Karin?

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.800
Ahem! How pathetic!

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.530
And you call yourself the man who killed Orochimaru?!

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.830
Orochimaru was already weakened to begin with.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.100
That's all there is to it.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.830
It just won't stop.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.300
It's strange to have this much rain around here at this time of year.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.730
You'll ruin your health.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:52.300
I don't know what someone as cold as you could be thinking about right now...

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.430
But from here, you look as though you are crying.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.030
It's too bad about your younger brother...

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.700
You are now the sole survivor of the Uchiha clan.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.270
No.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.430
Hmm?

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.700
He's not dead. Also...

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.900
What do you mean?

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.670
The rain...has stopped.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.700
Naruto!

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.600
Looks like it caught all our attention.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.400
What happened?!

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.000
There are signs that Sasuke was just here.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.070
It's very faint, but his scent still lingers.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.530
I also detect other scents.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.630
What does it mean?

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:03.700
From the damage to the terrain, I'd say there was a battle here.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.470
I knew it! One of the other scents belongs to that fellow in town

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.470
on whom I detected Sasuke's scent.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.730
Huh?

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:17.570
Looks like there are others traveling alongside Sasuke.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.530
He has a companion.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.800
Then, back there...

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.570
It's probable that...

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.300
Sasuke has formed his unit.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.370
One of the five other scents belongs to Deidara from Akatsuki.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.470
Wasn't he the one who self-destructed

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.200
and was transported to another dimension by your jutsu, Sensei?!

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:48.300
It seems he faked his own death to escape...

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:54.270
The Akatsuki operate in two-man cells, so there are three left.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.300
Sasuke is moving with a four-man cell.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.670
Who cares how many there are.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.300
Let's get moving and trace Sasuke's scent!

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.230
We can't.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.270
Huh? Why not?

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.100
The scent stops here.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.230
What does that mean?!

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.470
Usually in a situation like this,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.570
either Sasuke was blasted to bits by the explosion...

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.970
or Sasuke used the Transportation Technique to escape.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.370
Transportation Technique...?

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.170
It's probably the latter.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.230
My sense of smell is keener than a dog's right now.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.800
I've found Sasuke!

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.800
A nose that's sharper than the ninja hounds...?

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.330
Impressive, Kiba.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.470
Just what I would expect from a member of the Inuzuka clan.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.700
Kiba, lead the way!

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.200
Come, Pain...

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.400
He's here.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.600
And...what of Sasuke?

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.430
He's coming along nicely...

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.600
He was using the Sharingan's power to his fullest...

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.200
His eyes will surpass Itachi's...

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.300
The time has come. He must be ready as well.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.670
After all, he doesn't have much time.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.870
Then what about the Nine-Tails?

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.900
You hunt it. As leader, failure is not an option.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.300
INN OKOSHI

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.830
Hah! You talked about killing Itachi...

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.300
You won't be able to move around for some time in that condition!

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.430
We've been moving nonstop lately. It's a good chance to rest up.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.130
All you've done is rest, you feeble punk!

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.370
There, finished.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.730
You didn't do a thing at the northern hideout,

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.270
so don't start telling me what to do now.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.500
What?! Wanna make something of it?!

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.430
Then let's do it!

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:50.900
Enough already!

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.600
Suigetsu, Karin... Have you gathered data on Itachi?

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.770
You're in no shape to act so bossy!

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.430
I've picked up some tips about Akatsuki,

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.130
but nothing specific about Itachi himself.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.300
I got zero.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.670
Seems they're targeting specific people though...

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.400
People with special chakra.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.030
Special chakra...?

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.400
I did some talking to animals and located a number of Akatsuki hideouts.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.100
It seems they always sense

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.900
a powerful, unpleasant chakra around each area.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.600
That's what the animals have told me.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:47.730
Wow, even simpleminded animals can sense chakra, eh...?

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.730
Or maybe it's because they're simpleminded...

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.530
Just like you Karin!

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.900
What did you say, you jerk?!

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.200
Suigetsu! This time, you're not getting away with it!

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.700
Hey... W-Wait...hey!

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.570
Kill... I want to kill...

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.270
- Huh? - Huh?!

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.200
INN OKOSHI

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.570
Shoot! Jugo's killing impulse is loose!

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.170
Sasuke! Hurry it--!

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.000
Calm down, Jugo.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.800
S-Sorry...

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.330
It's your fault, Karin. Screaming and making such a fuss.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.700
What? You too...

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.600
You constantly try to provoke me, Karin.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.030
What are you up to?

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.500
I've already told you.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.470
I don't intend to leave Sasuke for my own reasons.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:45.430
I-I'm not up to anything.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:51.800
I'm just trying to test your... I...I need Sasuke.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.430
The only one who can replace Kimimaro...is Sasuke.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.600
Sasuke said he would become my cage...

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.530
Right now, only Sasuke can stop my urges,

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.030
like he did earlier...

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:13.970
Still... I don't know about her, but our cages are unlocked.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:19.000
We can escape anytime we wish. And yet...

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.400
I'm sure of it. It's this way!

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.200
From his scent, I can tell he's stopped moving.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.400
It seems he's resting.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.130
It's our chance.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.600
Sasuke... Our paths have finally crossed.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:09.330
Naruto Uzumaki... He's no longer just a kid.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.100
He has now mastered a formidable jutsu...

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.530
and has many comrades.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.400
It won't be easy.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.800
He even destroyed two of Kakuzu's lives with a single blow.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:24.900
To speak of the target as a threat has no meaning before Pain.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.070
He has never lost a battle.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.570
Well, that's true.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.700
We're done talking.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.530
Tell the other members to hurry with the remaining Jinchuriki.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.370
I know.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.400
At last...

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.530
We are so close to the moment of achieving our goal...

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.430
Then everything shall be restored to its rightful place...

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.370
The true power of the Sharingan...

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.100
The true power of I, Madara Uchiha!

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.630
The sky is crying again...

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.930
Pain... Are you...?

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.100
I'm coming in, Tsunade!

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.300
Jiraiya? Did you learn anything?

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.630
I discovered the whereabouts of the leader of "Akatsuki."

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.700
What?! Is that true?! Tell me more!

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.630
We'll use that information to plan a surprise attack!

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.470
Now now, don't be hasty.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.770
This isn't like plotting a sequel to your novel!

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.470
We don't have the time to waste!

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.370
Haste makes waste.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.830
Especially with the stakes as high as they are...

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:04.000
Next time: "Twilight"

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:09.630
Tune in again!
