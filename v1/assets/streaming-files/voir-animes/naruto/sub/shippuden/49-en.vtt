00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.030
For a guy like him, why are you...?

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.800
Why are you trying to get him back...

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.770
going so far as to oppose Orochimaru and put your life at risk?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.530
Why is that? When nobody's ordering you to do so?

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.800
Sasuke...

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.000
is my friend.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.400
It's a special bond I was finally able to make.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.670
A bond.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.770
Even so...

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.930
Even so, with Orochimaru as your opponent...

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.500
It doesn't matter who the opponent is!

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.300
If my arms get torn off, I'll kick him down.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.900
If my legs get torn off, I'll bite him down.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.330
If my head gets torn off, I'll stare him down.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.430
If my eyes get torn out, I'll curse him in my grave!

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.630
Even if I get chopped up into pieces...

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.930
I'll take Sasuke back from Orochimaru!

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.200
Something Important... 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.030
We'll go after I create the guard.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.500
I thought we'd completely given our pursuers the slip...

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.670
I guess I should say...

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.230
I'd expect no less from Lord Orochimaru's test subject...

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.970
Kabuto...!

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.370
You're sure persistent!

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.130
Sai...

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.600
Judging from your condition, it appears you've been captured.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.270
Don't interfere.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.800
If you do... I won't go easy on you!

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.230
It's futile.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.400
We won't know that until we try!

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.300
- We won't let you interfere! - We won't let you interfere!

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.930
You've got it wrong.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.600
I'm not talking about that.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.130
Aha...! This is impressive...

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.070
I guess with three against one, the odds are against me, huh?

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.970
And it appears they've got luck on their side as well...

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.800
I'll believe you...

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.600
since it doesn't appear you've betrayed us.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.200
Man, it's truly pathetic watching you guys.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.530
You in particular, Naruto.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.100
Watching you...

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:54.400
What I mean is, it's futile even if you were able to beat me...

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.200
People change...

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:07.470
Sasuke isn't the old Sasuke anymore.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:25.930
Wha--?!

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.330
What's the idea...?

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.700
I used to really hate Sasuke.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.800
But it was actually fun being with him.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.300
He's...

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.630
He's the person who acknowledged me more than anyone else.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.430
Sasuke is my friend.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.970
It's a special bond I was finally able to make.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.230
Your mission was supposed to be...

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.700
to become the liaison for Danzo and Lord Orochimaru.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.900
People change...

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.700
Then the same goes for me.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.030
What?!

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.070
But there are things that don't change...

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.170
Sai... You...

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.500
Bonds...

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.900
I want to see for myself...

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200
Sai...

00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:59.570
Sai...

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.870
Keep a hold on him...

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.530
Sai... What the heck are you thinking?

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.700
Why are you so hung up on your bonds with Sasuke...

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.600
and what are those bonds?

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.770
I want to know...

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.200
From your viewpoint,

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.430
it seems I can't erase my bond with my older brother...

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.500
The reason why you don't want to part with that book...

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.870
is that you can't forsake yourself as a younger brother...

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.170
It's because your bonds with your older brother...

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.900
were that important to you!

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.670
You don't want to erase the bonds you have with your older brother.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.070
Bonds...

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.130
If it's something that important to me,

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.670
then I might understand if I see your bonds with Sasuke.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.970
I just thought that way.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.930
What's so funny?!

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.330
You guys don't know the real Sasuke...

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.900
Where's Sasuke?

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.800
Answer me.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.330
He's probably done with his training right about now...

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.400
and is in a room deeper inside the hideout.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.770
It's true that Sasuke was training with Orochimaru.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.100
I don't think what he said just now is a lie.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
All right! Then let's get right to it-- However...

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.700
Where exactly is this room deeper inside...?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.730
I don't know, either.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.270
There are several rooms scattered about in here.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.230
A room deeper inside doesn't mean just one or two rooms...

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.070
In that case!

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.400
We just have to search every single one of them!

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:28.830
You're right.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.770
You might find it if you search at random.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.570
However...

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.600
You could stir up a serpent's nest.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.930
That's also where Lord Orochimaru's private room is, you see.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.570
Thanks for speaking honestly.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.370
No need to thank me.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.900
Are you saying the tables will be turned on us...?

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.370
Yeah.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800
You jerk!

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.000
That's something we won't know until we try.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.030
Let's go.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.400
We won't know until we try...huh?

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.000
Truly...pathetic...

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.530
Now we're going to split up and search for Sasuke.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.030
Sakura and I on one team.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.770
Naruto and Sai on the other.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.570
Right! Got it.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.770
If something comes up, build up your Chakra.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.100
I'll rush in right away just with that.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.870
Sasuke...

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.270
All right!

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.000
Let's go!

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.870
Hang on, Sasuke!

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.500
I'm coming now!

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.070
Here.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:17:02.400
Wh-What's with that...look... you...total...loser...

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:10.700
You jerk! What're you trying to look good for, you idiot?!

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:13.530
Sakura's this worried about... Naruto.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.470
I want to fight you...

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.870
For me, you've become...

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.500
my closest friend.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.170
Sasuke...!

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.500
Sakura...

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.070
Thanks...

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.230
Sasuke...

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:16.530
Naruto!

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.030
Right!

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.870
It looks like nobody's here.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.870
This isn't the place.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.770
Not here, either!

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.900
He's not here, either.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.970
He's not here!

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.630
He's not here.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.600
Damn it!

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.300
Sasuke...

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.000
Where are you?!

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.630
Where are you?!

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.730
We've...finally made it this far!

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.100
Where are you?!

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.470
Sasuke...!

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.570
Sasuke!

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.700
Naruto, we're split up into two teams.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.370
You should rest a little...

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.600
Shut up! I can't be resting at a time like this.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.200
We're almost to Sasuke...

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.530
Man, you're certainly talkative, you lose your head...

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:53.830
and you have no manners.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.430
Mind your own business!

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.430
You really resemble him.

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:00.300
Resemble who?

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.700
My older brother.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.600
Next time: "The Picture Book's Story"
