WEBVTT

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.070
You came all this way to the hot springs.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.860
You should take it easy and stay a bit longer.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.900
At any rate, I'm an impatient man.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.740
There seems to be a storm headed our way, so do be careful.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.940
Thank you very much for everything.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.490
I better hurry.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.070
You're Tadaichi, a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf, correct?

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.530
Well yes, I am from the Hidden Leaf.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.240
But I wouldn't call myself a shinobi. I'm just a lowly merchant.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.190
You can't fool me.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.240
I checked up on you and found out what you did when were in the ANBU.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.820
Visual Jutsu…?!

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.190
Beautifully done.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.650
I'm going to stain everything red.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.320
The Exploding Human So, what are you doing here?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.150
Sakura said she was coming to see you, so I tagged along.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.280
What is it, Sakura?

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.900
There have been incidents of Hidden Leaf shinobi going missing.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.280
Going missing?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.070
So you noticed it too, Sakura.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.990
You were already aware of it, Kakashi Sensei?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.820
Yes. But why were you investigating something like that?

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.820
Well, there's a regular at Ino's family's flower shop…

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.780
It's coming from the Aun Gate.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.940
I'll go check it out, ya know!

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.070
Oh… Wait, Naruto!

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.940
Hey, you two!

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.030
I'm counting on you.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.900
Run! Get away from here!

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.490
It's the Security Unit…

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.780
Why are they only using defense?

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.690
I'm gonna help 'em!

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.610
Wait!

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.990
Ino? Shikamaru…Choji?

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.860
What happened?

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.110
It can't be…

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.940
Mr. Tadaichi…

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.990
That's Mr. Tadaichi!

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.900
Mr. Tadaichi?

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.030
You mean your regular from the flower shop?

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.030
Are you sure that's him, Ino?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.940
There's no mistake!

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.860
But he'd never turn against the Hidden Leaf!

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.490
So why?

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.110
So does that mean…

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.860
there's a possibility he's under genjutsu?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.860
And the others could be the ones who went missing!

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.030
What?!

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.900
Then…these are Hidden Leaf shinobi?

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.900
That's why we can't do anything other than defend!

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.530
He didn't even dodge.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.940
Doesn't he feel any pain?

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.030
This is bad!

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.320
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.990
Naruto?!

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.440
We're gonna jump away.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.440
He's an exploding human!

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.990
Mr. Tadaichi…

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.780
It's okay.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.400
Let's go tend to the wounded.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.900
Hey!

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.860
They're getting in!

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.280
Not…them too!

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.360
It's too big!

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.570
Damn!

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.690
Choji…

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.570
Can you bring out your wings with your expansion?

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.320
G-Got it!

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.440
I'll help!

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.150
Let's go, Kurama!

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.780
Right!

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.530
Did…it help at all?

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.990
Good job!

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.820
Looks like it ain't over yet.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.030
There are more of them.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.940
Naruto!

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.240
Getting wounded is probably what causes them to explode.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.360
I saw strange chakra being released from the wound,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.190
and the body began to change shape.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.030
Which means, we have to be careful how we engage them.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.400
Naruto!

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.900
Hinata!

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.900
What's happening?

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.320
It seems everyone's under a genjutsu.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.030
Can you see if someone's controlling them?

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.570
All right, I'll check.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:05.860
Byakugan!

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.940
I don't see anyone.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.150
No one?!

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.530
Then how are they being manipulated?

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.030
There's a strange chakra moving around in their bodies.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.650
Maybe that's what's controlling them.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.030
So we just have to take that chakra away?

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.320
The chakra is circulating like it's part of their body.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.320
The chakra could be fused internally.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.440
So you're saying we can't just peel it away easily.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.940
First things first.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.780
We have to start by capturing them.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.360
But Shikamaru,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.940
it'll be hard to capture them without inflicting any wounds.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.110
I just had a great idea!

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.150
Okay, let's go!

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.650
First, I'll have my clones stop the exploding humans.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.860
Shadow Possession Jutsu!

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.940
Then Shikamaru will capture them with his Shadow Possession Jutsu.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.280
Hinata!

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.490
Right!

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.860
And lastly, Hinata will pierce their critical chakra points

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.110
so that they can't move.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.150
They won't be able to move for a day.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.690
You okay, Hinata?

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.570
Yes.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.740
I'll fight with you.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.900
It's no good.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.900
My Genjutsu Reversal has no effect against

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.900
the special kind of chakra circulating in the body.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.650
Don't get so depressed.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.860
Whoever did it, that's a genjutsu unknown to us.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.190
It has to be the work of someone with extraordinary skill.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.070
So it will require someone with exceptional Visual Jutsu powers.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.190
Visual Jutsu?

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.860
Good observation!

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.990
I-I didn't say anything!

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.610
Didn't say what?

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.860
Don't ask!

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.990
Naruto!

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.940
We may not be able to see anything.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.070
But the one who possesses both the Sharingan and Rinnegan just might.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.900
Huh?! You mean…?

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.190
I'll call Sasuke back.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.440
Can I ask you to do it?

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:04.440
Yes.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.070
Sasuke's gonna come back!

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.400
I am all alone.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.360
I alone can bear the weight of all the hatred now.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.150
You don't have a clue about how Itachi lived!

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:45.240
Why do all that just to get in my way?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.740
‘Cuz you're my friend.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.400
I've heard that before.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.320
But what exactly does that mean?

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.990
You ask me to explain it, but I really can't put it into words.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.990
It's just that…

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.240
when I see you take on stuff and get all messed up…

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.820
It…

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.440
kinda…

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.780
hurts me.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.860
Return to the Hidden Leaf Village, huh?

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.690
A human exploded!

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.360
D-Damn you!

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.280
Stop!

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.940
Don't tell me that's the exploding human

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.650
that attacked the Hidden Leaf?!

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.070
Why? A village like this?

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.070
Old Man Iou!

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.900
Chino, stall them.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.440
You got it, Nowaki!

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.490
Water Style: Water Formation Wall!

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:23.570
Shinobi?

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.030
What's going on?

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.940
W-What?!

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.900
Are you one of them?

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.240
You've got it all wrong.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.190
Silence!

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.070
They asked you to come and get even, didn't they?

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.610
Get even?

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.530
Young ones! What are you doing?

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.650
Damn it!

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.900
Sorry, I don't have anything against you, but…

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:54.940
Water Style…

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.440
Rain Hail!

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.440
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.190
What?!

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.860
I didn't know Fire Style could beat Water Style!

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.440
Get back.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.280
A Change in Nature of Wind, huh?

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.570
Oh, come on! Hurry up and kill him!

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.860
No one told me he was so strong!

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.240
You spineless—!

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:44.240
You can tell me later why you mistook me for someone else.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.320
That eye…

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:56.990
The Sharingan?!

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.320
Uchiha…

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.070
Why did the villagers end up like this?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.820
How should I know?!

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.530
The one you mistook me for is involved in some way, right?

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.400
I've got nothing to say!

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.110
I-I'm sorry.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.030
We don't know what's going on either.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.780
From the looks of it, you're not from this village, are you?

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.360
We're former shinobi who are now traveling performers.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.860
We finished a gig at a resort

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.860
in the Village Hidden in the Hot Springs.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.320
It's pretty profitable there for entertainers like us.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.940
Anyway… We decided to head somewhere else,

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.440
so we came through the Bamboo Village to stock up on supplies.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:52.400
And Old Man Iou's daughter is such a great person!

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.110
She made us really good food!

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:59.360
By the way, is my daughter… Is Amino okay?

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.030
Amino!

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.570
We had all the women and children take shelter…

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.690
Hey!

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.860
We have no choice but to ask these guys directly.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.740
Amino?!

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.940
An exploding human?!

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.530
Mr. Iou, don't go near. It's too dangerous.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.360
Who cares if it's dangerous?!

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.530
That's my daughter!

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.280
Let go… Let me go!

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.240
Amino!

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.570
I'll never forgive you.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.990
Never…Fuushin…

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:23.240
I'll never forgive you, Fuushin!

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.780
Who is Fuushin?

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.940
The leader of the Lightning Gang.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:47.190
The Lightning Gang?

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.610
They take money from bad people

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.990
and distribute it to poor people like us.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.320
They're honorable thieves.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.610
So why would their leader try to get even?

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.690
This is just what I heard…

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.530
The Lightning Gang was betrayed by the Hidden Mist…

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.190
It seems they barely escaped with their lives

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.940
and found their way to this village.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.860
Just for a little while… Let us rest here.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.900
Please go somewhere else.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.070
What?

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.860
If we harbor you, we'll end up paying dearly for it!

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.440
We have no intentions of troubling the village!

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.440
We'll leave right away!

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.860
Just because you take money from others and give it away,

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.690
don't think you can do whatever you want!

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.530
The village rejected the Lightning Gang.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.650
What are you going to do?

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.320
I'm going to look inside memories of the exploding humans.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.570
Huh?

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.900
Are you okay?

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.740
That red eye… There's no doubt about it…

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.650
It's a Kekkei Genkai.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.000
It's Sasuke, right?

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.210
You can call me Yamato.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.000
The attack of the Exploding Humans in the Leaf…

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.540
There's a possibility that Orochimaru has information

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.880
that links all of the victims.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.790
It would make it easier for us to cooperate,

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.250
if you give us each and every detail.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.750
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Sasuke's Story: Sunrise, Part 2: Coliseum"

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.580
We just have to do what needs to be done.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:28.880
Tune in again!
