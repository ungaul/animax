WEBVTT

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.730
W-We...did it!

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.170
We did it!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.730
We did it...

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.030
To tell the truth, that was a very dangerous situation.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.070
Without Shikamaru's accurate analysis...

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.170
we probably would have been completely done for.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.700
Good grief...

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.600
He's really something...

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.100
It's no wonder Asuma puts so much confidence in him.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.400
Shikamaru!
Are you all right?

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.100
Yeah. With this, there remains...

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.900
Only one more left, huh?

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.730
If you wanted help, you should have said so sooner.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.900
You were too slow, Kakuzu!

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.730
You did that on purpose, didn't you?!

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.400
You were the one who told me to butt out at the beginning.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.870
So are you really in any position to complain?

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.600
Well, I did order you to hold back.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.200
But that wasn't because

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.070
I was trying to make a fool of you or disrespect you.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.570
Well, never mind about that. Anyway, bring my body over here.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.500
Kakuzu... Will you bring my body...?

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.730
Come on Kakuzu, buddy.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.300
Wha--?! Hey! Wait a minute!

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.930
See here, Kakuzu! What about my body?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.370
I thought I told you to bring my body over here!

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.770
This is lighter.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.870
That's not the issue, now is it?

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.770
Are you ignoring me? Hey!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.230
Unfulfilled Scream

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.570
Ouch...it hurts...hey!

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.800
Kakuzu, you're pulling my hair! Stop that!

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.130
If you are hurting at all, it should be in your neck.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.330
You moron!

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.170
The pain in my neck isn't a tickle.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.670
It's excruciating! This is more than just a simple injury.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.000
That guy...

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.530
In that state, he's still alive!

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.070
It hurts like crazy! See here!

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.100
The nerve of you, cutting off my head!

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.200
This is incredibly painful, you numbskull!

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.430
Wh-What's that? What's going on?

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.970
I don't know what to think of this...

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.170
At this rate...

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.900
Even if he's still alive, he's useless in that condition.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.200
It appears he can't move unless he's connected to a body.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.470
His arts are useless in that state.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.430
He may be immortal, but right now, he can't do anything.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.730
That's for sure.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.700
So then, there's only one opponent left.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.000
Yes...

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.770
That may be, but that one...

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.430
No doubt he possesses powers and speed that exceed the immortal guy.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.330
What's more, he'll have the kind of cool nerve

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.130
you can't fight against on the strength of pure momentum alone.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.770
And furthermore...

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.270
He'll be the hard-nosed kind that doesn't budge in the slightest,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.530
even if his comrades get done in... a real heart of stone.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.530
We have yet to see his true power.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.570
Or rather, his confidence may be due to the fact that he has not shown it yet.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.930
This kind of enemy is always gauging the difference in strength

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.330
between himself and his opponents and calculating his advantages.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.700
In that case, he may think it's in his best interests

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.230
to convince us of being in an advantageous position.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.470
Shikamaru!

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.400
Shikamaru has really pushed himself to his limit.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.770
Captain Asuma is injured too.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.600
 We are at an advantage in that

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.600
 we have immobilized one of the Akatsuki Organization's members, but...

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.730
On the other hand,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.370
you could also say this gives us the opportunity to escape.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.100
In that case, the thing we need to worry about is...

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.670
Shikamaru's condition.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.900
You mustn't open yourself up to attack!

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.600
He is such a pushover.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.300
Captain Asuma!

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.870
Since you've now asked me to lend a hand,

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.000
I'm going to join in too.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.770
I get it...

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.130
Ow! Ouch!

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.430
Hey, hold still, will you?

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.230
Those guys...

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.070
What are they up to?

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.500
Okay, that should do it.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.370
His head...

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.300
It's been reconnected.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.100
It's good to be whole again.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.400
If you move around too much, it'll come off again.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.500
Kakuzu, you're always such a nag.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.530
What on earth...are we fighting?

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.030
An immortal man... and a man who possesses a Jutsu

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.430
that can sew back together a dismembered body...

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:54.770
Damn!

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.200
It's just one thing after another. How powerful are they?!

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.530
Your fights and your complaining seem to go on forever.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.530
Just like your ceremonies.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.530
You take care of the one with the price on his head.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.630
I'll pay them back in spades.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.000
Because it wouldn't do to violate the commandment.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.570
That again?

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.700
Well, never mind. As for the three remaining...

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.170
I'll take care of them.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.330
Izumo!

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.300
Got it!

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:34.600
Right!

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.170
Water Style: Syrup Trap!

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.100
Right!

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.870
Did that do the trick?

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.470
I suppose you meant to grab your opponent's attention

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.530
with that eye-catching aerial attack to create an opening.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And then follow-up with a land attack

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.900
by coordinating your movements with this strange liquid, but...

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.670
I think it's half-baked.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.800
There's too much wasted effort.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.670
Now!

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:49.700
What--?!
Right!

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.970
Before you know it...

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.130
That's great! Izumo!

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.700
You're mine!

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.770
Kotetsu!

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.030
Damn...!

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:37.930
Huh?!

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.130
They're giving me a good run for my money.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.770
Well now, Kakuzu seems to be finishing up pretty soon...

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.130
Isn't it about time I stepped in?

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.800
Otherwise, I'll start hearing about how my ceremonies "go on forever."

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.070
So long.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.730
Asuma!

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:30.900
Behind you!

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.530
So long!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.030
Asuma!

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.270
Behind you!

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.270
It's the same moves over and over again.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.830
Not the same, you moron!

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:13.830
Damn!

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.400
Damn!

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.500
In the end...

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.230
In the end, even you were willing to sacrifice yourself

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.200
 to protect your comrades!

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.200
I don't get it!

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.530
What's wrong with this strategy?!

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.670
If I succeeded in my Shadow Sewing,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.900
then we would have been able to stop the enemy

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.100
and reduce their fighting power by half.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.330
But when I tried to make Shadow Sewing work on a distant opponent,

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.870
I just fell into a trap.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.400
So Shadow Sewing is not necessarily effective against a distant opponent.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.930
Yet, if Shadow Sewing is used in close combat,

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.070
its binding force becomes more powerful, and its success rate increases.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.400
Isn't that what the strategy is for?

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.830
Are you suggesting a two-top formation

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.930
in which you use Shadow Sewing aggressively

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.330
at the front lines backed by my charging power?

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.470
That's it.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.800
With that formation,

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.870
I'd be able to tie up the enemy at the front lines.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.600
Shikamaru, I think highly of your strategy.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.130
Well, in that case, why not try it?

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.730
That's the very reason why it's no good!

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.470
This unit is excellent.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.070
In terms of fighting power,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.070
it's simply a four-man cell including three Chunin...

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.700
but my unit has a strategist that's lacking in other units.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.630
Shikamaru, that's you!

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.170
A good strategist assesses conditions from back in the rear guard

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.970
and directs the movements of the unit off the basis of that judgment.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:06.000
You have superb powers of judgment, and it's an advantage to the unit.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.100
Bringing you around to the front lines could actually increase the risks we face

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.000
in carrying out our mission.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.230
Even I...

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.470
Even I understand the pain of losing a comrade.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.170
Isn't that a good reason why it's the best possible strategy?

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.700
I understand there's some risk involved.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.870
If it enables me to protect many of my comrades...

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.670
If by " protecting your comrades" you're referring to us,

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.470
then you don't understand at all.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.800
The things that we're protecting...

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.930
The reasons we're fighting...

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.630
Unless you understand the true meaning of that,

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.400
there's no way I can put you out in the front lines.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.500
It's my fault...

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.330
If I... If I had thought up a better strategy...

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.930
none of this would ever have...

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:07.900
Don't you get it?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.930
That' s the best thing we can do right now!

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.630
I've never seen Asuma like this before.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.470
It's like sending in an advance unit to break through enemy lines.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.130
Sometimes you have to be able to make a move like that.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.870
A straightforward attack like the Climbing Silver doesn't suit you.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:27.100
I won't be a mere sacrificial piece. I've got you with me, after all.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.070
Damn! Damn!

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.070
It's my fault...

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.970
It's my fault...

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.970
If I hadn't been such a numbskull.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.070
Asuma wouldn't be in such a fix!

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.530
How is it? Does it hurt? Huh?

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.830
Well, how about it?!

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.230
Finally...

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.830
I finally get to taste that pain.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.270
The pain of killing you...

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:36.930
Captain!

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.370
Damn!

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.700
It's over.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.300
Stop...

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.070
Asuma...

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.100
I-It feels so good...

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.170
Asuma!

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.170
Don't bother trying to patch me up.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.030
This is as far as I go.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.530
That much...I understand.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.670
The things the Third Hokage did to protect the village.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.370
I feel like I only now have come to understand them.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.830
I'm always so slow.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.830
And so, Ino, Choji, Shikamaru...

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.970
I have some last words I'd like to say to you...

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.670
Next time: "Last Words"
