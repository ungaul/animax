WEBVTT

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.530
Long time no see, you Ino-Shika-Cho brats.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.110
You're Kakuzu, right?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.280
We took the "Gold."

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.480
As for you, the "Bishop,"

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.230
we know your tricks and how good you are.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.480
From now on, we're on the offensive.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.780
The brat who uses shadows.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.530
Your being here means that Hidan has been stopped, huh?

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.780
Did he get his head chopped off again,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.530
while he was praying?

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.480
Or does it mean he's not here because he's still alive?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.150
As if we know what he's doing while he's rotting away somewhere!

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.530
So I don't have a rook,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.900
my gold and silver are taken, and I'm completely on the defensive.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.360
That's the fifth one.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.530
That's right. That guy has five hearts.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.070
So we have to bring him down five times.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.190
Yeah, you're right.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.480
Time to finish the game.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.440
By the way, we also have gold and silver pieces too.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.650
Would you be interested in knowing who they might be?

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.190
Dan Kato… Lady Tsunade's lover.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.650
And…

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.780
Asuma Sarutobi.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.650
The son of the Third Hokage, and your master.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.110
Asuma…Sensei!

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.480
I guess you're not the only ones who took game pieces.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.940
We have a few others as well.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.650
Ironic, isn't it?

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.820
Why you—!

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.320
Choza!

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.480
Why is the Four Flames Formation taking so long?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.480
Hurry up and shut me inside the barrier…

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.190
before I use my Ghost Transformation Jutsu!

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.480
It's not that simple.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.440
Not when you're the target!

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.400
A weird black thing has appeared!

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.030
Watch out!

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.820
Let's begin our counterattack.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.400
We owe you something.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.030
I hope you haven't forgotten, you stringy mess!

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.820
Sorry, I don't remember anyone who can't make me money.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.530
They say that money talks, even in hell.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.150
Was that true for you?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.400
Masters!

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.150
Izumo, Kotetsu!

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.320
Shikamaru! Choji! Ino!

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.400
Help us seal him!

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.400
– All right. – Right!

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.400
Izumo, Kotetsu…

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.940
You two and Darui will be left to deal with Kakuzu.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.110
Kakuzu uses Earth Style.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.610
Center your battle on Darui's Lightning Style.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.070
Shikamaru, Choji and Ino will take on Asuma.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.320
But…that's too harsh!

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.610
Master Asuma is their teacher!

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.070
You can't do that!

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.530
They were Asuma subordinates, the former Team 10.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.610
They know Asuma better than anyone else.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.570
They have the best chance of winning.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.900
But… No complaining! This is war!

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.070
One that must be won!

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.730
But…

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.980
I…

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.190
True Kindness

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.360
Watch out!

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.190
Hey Choji!

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.530
This makes it seem like Shikamaru is my only opponent!

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.820
But it's gonna hurt, you know.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.570
I'm strong and I don't wanna hurt you two.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.280
What makes you think you're better?

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.900
Go ahead, try and hurt us!

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.150
C'mon! Cry! Scream!

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.070
Stop! You're hurting me!

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.030
Damn it… What a drag.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.860
Choji, are you being gentle because they're your friends?

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.730
Asuma Sensei…

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.610
If that's the case, you're wrong.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.980
Sparring with a stronger partner will only help

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.070
to make them stronger too.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.030
You don't get it?

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.570
Then I'll show you.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.860
We're going to spar right now.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.230
If you're able to strike me, you pass.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.730
But if you're not able to hit me within one hour, Choji…

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.400
Not just you,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.730
but Ino and Shikamaru will be sent back to the Academy.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.400
Huh? No fair!

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.150
Think of me as the enemy and charge, for their sake too.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.650
Transform your kindness into power.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.980
Choji!

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.530
Are you all right?

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.110
U-Uh-huh…

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.690
What's the matter with you guys?

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.400
Go to Asuma now!

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.110
If you truly care about your comrades,

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.530
instead of running away,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.570
you need to set your mind on improving yourself!

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.190
That's what true comrades are, you coward!

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.400
I'm counting on you, Shikamaru.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.480
I'm going.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.070
Shikamaru!

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.190
What'll you do, Ino?

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.900
Choji!

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.730
Take a good look around you, at your comrades!

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.610
Go!

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.230
Come at me!

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.400
Choza!

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.860
I know!

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.440
Choji…

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.530
Do you remember Asuma Sensei's dying words?

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.070
Choji…

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.190
You're a kind man who cares for his comrades…

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.440
That's why…

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.570
you'll become a shinobi who's stronger than anyone else.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.400
Be more confident in yourself.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.730
You're strong-willed, and dependable.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.480
Both Choji and Shikamaru, they're clumsy.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.030
So please take care of them.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.900
Let's go, you guys.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.980
Right!

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.440
U-Uh-huh…

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.610
We're counting on you three!

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.480
All right!

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.150
The kunai were to distract us.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.440
This is what they were after.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.730
Did they succeed?!

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.150
Not yet!

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.730
Asuma, I have to stop you!

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.570
Nice move, considering how hastily it was formed.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.400
Keep cornering me like that.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.570
Right!

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.980
Once more!

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.860
But this time, our aim is to restrain, not destroy!

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.650
Understood.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.820
Damn it! What's keeping the Sealing Team?!

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.230
So strong!

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.230
Damn it!

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.530
Fire Style! Burning Ash!

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.070
What is this…?!

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.190
A smoke screen?!

00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.980
It's you guys…

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.570
It took time to find that important sword.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.730
Now then, where's that damn Kakuzu?

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.070
I picked this up earlier…

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.900
What? I'm pretty good at using it!

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.190
You're not getting away!

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.280
All right! I got the one that produces thunder!

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.280
This thing is great! But I wonder who lost it?

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.440
I feel like this uses an enormous amount of chakra.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.610
But I can't worry about that now!

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.440
Did you think I'd stay put?

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.480
Captain Darui!

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.860
I got the orders from HQ…

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.610
But!

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.860
Captain, we should use the Lightning Style in one blow.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.480
I'm sorry. I went overboard earlier.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.570
Black Panther!

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.730
Laser Circus!

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.400
– Double Black Panther! – Double Black Panther!

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.480
I don't have enough chakra.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.980
Can you give me a moment?

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.690
We're going after him, Kotetsu!

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:05.400
Right!

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.860
I'm really sorry.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.440
We're prepared for the inevitable.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.480
So Sensei, please be prepared too.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.400
Choji…Shikamaru…Ino…

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.480
You've become fine shinobi.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.480
That's all thanks to you!

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.230
Show me what you've got, Ino-Shika-Cho!

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.690
We'll cut him down in one sweep!

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.030
A Substitution Jutsu!

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.980
Run!

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.400
Your movements are slow, Choji!

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:14.820
Pull yourself together!

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.980
He's coming!

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.480
Shikamaru!

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.690
Cast your Shadow Possession to lead me towards Choji.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.360
That's just what I plan to do!

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.400
Shadow Possession Jutsu!

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.110
One more move!

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.820
Even if it's a bluff,

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.480
if he knows Mind Transfer Jutsu, he'll ward it off!

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.570
If he dodges the Shadow Possession and makes a run for it,

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.730
he'll be in Ino's blind spot.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.480
Exactly what I hoped for! And there…

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.400
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.070
Checkmate, Asuma!

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.610
Now, Choji!

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.320
All right!

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.940
What're you doing, Choji!

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.530
Snap out of it!

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.980
We prepared ourselves for this!

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440
Choji…!

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.610
This is… This is too much for me!

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.400
I can't take our Sensei down!

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.280
Choji!

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.900
Move!
That's…!

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.940
Wind Style! Dust Storm Jutsu!

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.530
Damn it!

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:13.610
He countered it!

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.530
Are you all right?!

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:24.900
Barely.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.900
Why? Why does it have to be like this?!

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.860
It's too late to whine!

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.860
We agreed to stop Asuma ourselves!

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.610
What's with that look on your face, Choji?

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.690
Right now, I am your enemy, plain and simple!

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.070
I'm already dead!

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.610
Don't hesitate!

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.030
I know. I know that, but…

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.400
Even back then, Sensei, you…

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.940
What's the matter, Choji?

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.780
Do you want the three of you to go back to the Academy?

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.530
I wonder if he'll do it?

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:16.690
Fight, Choji, you coward!

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.940
That's not the way. It'll only backfire.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.400
It's not because Choji's scared.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.440
He doesn't want to hurt Asuma Sensei the way he's hurting now.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.610
He's very kind, down to his very core.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:39.730
But as it is…

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.820
We have no choice.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.320
Hey Choji! Enough already, you fatso!

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.360
Shikamaru…

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.400
Did you just say "fatso"?

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.730
Yeah…I said "fatso."

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.110
That's what Asuma Sensei said.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.030
Really…Sensei?

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.280
Y-Yeah…

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.940
Yes! He said that a fatso like you wouldn't be able to punch him!

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.070
You're going overboard, Ino.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.860
I don't care if you're my Sensei.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.360
Anyone who calls me "fatso" is gonna get it!

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.480
I'm sorry…

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.610
I can't hit you after all, Sensei.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:47.650
But…but, please just send me back to the Academy.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.860
Please don't punish Shikamaru and Ino.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.570
I understand, Choji.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.150
It's my loss.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.110
No matter how angry you are,

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.690
you are able to suppress it, and think of your opponent.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.940
You have true kindness within you.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.730
I want you to continue nurturing that kindness.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.230
Someday, it will become your strength.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.690
But you know, when you are sparring… I know!

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.440
I don't want to beat people like you or Shikamaru

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.480
or Ino or my friend's from the village.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:35.070
But if I'm up against anyone who hurts them, I'll fight them.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:42.690
Even if Shikamaru and Ino keep calling me "fatso."

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.440
By the way, Shikamaru and Ino, Choji isn't fat.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.230
He's just pleasingly plump.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.570
Asuma Sensei, you said it's okay if I'm like this.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.190
Now, Choji!

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.820
I know you are kind.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.150
But right now, taking me down is kindness!

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.440
This is the time to transform your kindness into strength!

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.400
Now is the time, Choji!

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.280
Please! You must stop me!

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.570
Enough is enough, fatso!

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:38.940
Just try and take me down!

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.400
Did you call me "fatso"?

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.030
You just said "fatso," right?

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:55.480
I am not… I am not fat…

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.610
I'm just pleasingly plump!

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.480
I thought that oath was just part of a ritual.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:47.610
I thought both my heart and body would get stronger when I got older.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.320
But now, I…

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.480
I have to change!

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.530
