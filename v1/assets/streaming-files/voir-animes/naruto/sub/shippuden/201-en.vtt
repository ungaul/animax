00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.810
Who are you really?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.980
I'm nobody. I don't want to be anybody.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.310
I just want to fulfill Project Tsuki no Me.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.600
That is enough.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.060
It's not worth living in this world where only despair exists.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.140
You Jinchuriki had Tailed Beasts forced upon you

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.180
and you've only experienced despair… Am I wrong?

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.520
Surely, you can understand a little of my despair…

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.270
Who the hell are you to decide…

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.850
that having a Tailed Beast inside me makes me unhappy?!

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.640
Even if this world is worthless to you,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.230
you really think you can get away with starting a war

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.100
and trying to play off that you're a nobody?

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.520
You piss me off…

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.310
I'm gonna rip that mask off of you!

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.810
I'll go first! Wheee!

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.140
Taking this mask off of me…

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.730
won't be so easy.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.770
Eight Tails… Nine Tails…

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.100
You shall be mine…

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.430
and I'll achieve Project Tsuki no Me!

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.640
We're not gonna let you have Nine Tails or Eight Tails!

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.270
What's going on?

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.390
I thought their Tailed Beasts were extracted from them?!

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.560
They were probably made back into Jinchuriki

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.850
after they were reanimated…

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.100
I can also sense that

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.480
the Tailed Beasts are a bit different from before too…

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.390
Be careful!

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.060
You too? Getting bad vibes?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.230
Gotta be careful for our lives

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.350
Corrosion Style!

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.520
Scorching Rocks Jutsu!

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.100
This isn't a case of mistaken identity I take it…

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.350
My weaknesses have already been carefully researched.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.480
So now, how will you deal with this?

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.480
He turned his body into lava?!

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.140
He's trickier than I thought.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.810
Water Style! Giant Exploding Water Shock Wave.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.310
He's not all talk either.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.310
I wish you'd just allow yourself to be captured

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.020
without all this fuss.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.270
What a pain.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.810
You're back.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.180
Yeah, but having to bring him back without killing him

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.180
was quite bothersome.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.230
It's starting to rain.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.310
Looks like it'll storm.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.140
Let's take cover under a tree.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.850
Or we'll catch a cold.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.060
Our leader is waiting for word of his capture.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.770
Immediately after that, the sealing of

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.230
the Three Tails and Four Tails is to occur simultaneously.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.100
We'll make him wait a little.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.140
Because once the sealing starts, we'll be working nonstop.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.730
He seems to be near death.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.680
You really should treat the elderly with care.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.100
You say that because you don't know him.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.060
This Jinchuriki who uses

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.310
the Corrosion Style Jutsu of the Four Tails

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.890
isn't what you think he is.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.270
You didn't fight him,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.180
so you don't know what I just went through.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.170
Jinchuriki vs. Jinchuriki!

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.500
Samehada is ready to fight That's fine with me…

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.290
'Cuz I'm raring to go… Are ya ready?

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.080
Hold it, Octopops!

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.960
Nice moves…

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.170
OK! She hasn't spied my…KO!

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.540
You didn't even see me, so how'd you dodge?! Fool, ya fool!

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.040
That's not gonna work, Octopops!

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.080
It's just like the time I fought the Six Paths of Pain.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.170
Their eyes…

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.830
They're Rinnegan are all linked. They're hooked up to each other!

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.210
What the hell does that mean?!

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.630
It's the same as Nagato's Gedo Jutsu!

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.290
So they've got the eyesight… of six guys!

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.040
Damn, I can't even talk…!

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.170
Hot!

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.170
Aw man! It's Yugito's Rodent Hair Ball!

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.380
It's coming after us!

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.170
It's like a guided missile Time to run, let's hustle

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.290
Yugito's moves are different from before…

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.580
Half left of my expensive scarf… What a surprise

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.420
Now it's only worth half the price

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.250
It's that Sharingan!

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.170
That's how they're able to track us so closely!

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.670
Their Visual Prowess is enhancing their Jinchuriki abilities!

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.830
On top of that, with their shared vision,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.000
the six Jinchuriki can position themselves

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.040
and time their attacks with more precision.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.710
Bee! Let me talk to Naruto!

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.500
Yo!

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.580
Naruto… They're cleverly combining

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.250
the two types of Visual Prowess and their Jinchuriki abilities.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.420
They're probably on to us too.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.500
What do we do?

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.670
We have no choice

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.710
but to take down six Jinchuriki one by one!

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.130
If it's the same as that time with Nagato,

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.000
they're all controlled by chakra.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.130
Back then, in order to get chakra,

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.670
black receivers were stuck to their bodies.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.960
I see… If we remove it or destroy it…

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.500
the Gedo Jutsu would be undone.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.000
But that's going to be a problem.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.670
It's hard enough landing a blow on them.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.040
And we can't even pinpoint where these black receivers are.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.080
You mean, that thing?

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:30.790
Huh?

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.290
Where?!

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:39.500
Take a close look around Yugito's bosom And you'll see that black protrusion

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.250
At first, I thought it was her ni--!

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.880
When they're flaunted, it's unappealing

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.080
But just a little glimpse, it's a good feeling

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.420
This battle is going to determine the future.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.170
And you're only thinking about…

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.630
That's it!

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.880
I'm going to go check out the others.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.500
Wait, Naruto!

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.290
Our attacks don't work, and we can't catch them…

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.130
Hot!

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.710
I'll just have to put up with their attacks and grab them!

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.630
Rasengan!

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.580
I knew it was here!

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.080
Then… I'll just…!

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.130
Are you two all right?

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:01.880
Ouch…

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.960
Bee… We're at a disadvantage fighting them in the woods.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.750
Your field of vision is narrowed!

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.040
You get me, don't you, Bee?!

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.420
Oh…yeah…

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.000
Blow up the entire forest!

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.630
I'm the Killer Bee and Eight Tails is here with me!

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.000
Wheee!

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.320
Don't fall off of me, Naruto Cuz' now, the real fight's a go!

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.110
Eight-Tailed Beast Twister!

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.030
SHINOBI

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.070
It seems Lord Bee has undergone

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.820
the Tailed Beast transformation already!

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.230
I sense the immense chakra of the Eight Tails!

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.320
It feels like they're on the defensive!

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.360
Things aren't looking too good, are they?

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.110
Frankly…

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.320
However, the Five Kage have Madara on the defensive!

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.440
We're doing okay for now!

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.980
The Five Kage are working together.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.150
They have to have the edge!

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.440
What's the status of each company?!

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.570
The First and Second Companies

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.320
are on the verge of annihilating the enemy.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.650
Only 27 more…!

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.650
26! 25!

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.070
I'm feeling tired, but… I'll give it one more try…!

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.110
Just a few more and we'll be done here!

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.820
Hey! Kurotsuchi!

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.030
Don't run off on your own!

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.570
You're too slow, Dad!

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.280
Leave the rest…to me!

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.820
Earth Style! Erupt!

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.150
The Third Company is down to two Reanimations.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.980
Out of all the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist,

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.610
only Mangetsu Hozuki is left.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.690
I'm getting bored of fighting these guys.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.650
Yeah…

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.030
The Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist…

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.860
Zabuza Momochi,

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.570
Ameyuri Ringo,

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.900
Kushimaru Kuriarare,

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.360
Jinin Akebino,

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.980
Jinpachi Munashi,

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.820
Fuguki Suikazan…

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.110
The only one left is…Mangetsu Hozuki.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.030
Now's the time to show them the Way of the Samurai!

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.480
Let's show 'em the Ninja Way of Puppet Masters!

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.900
It appears the Fifth Company needs a little more time…

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.070
But there's no doubt that they have the upper hand!

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.320
All right!

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.070
Tell the First, Second, Third and Fifth Companies

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.320
as soon as they wrap up…

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.440
They are to head over to assist Naruto and Lord Bee!

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.690
What are their coordinates, Lord Ao?

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.730
W-Wow…

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.480
They're all knocked out!

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.440
Seal them now, Bee!

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.440
Hey, Octopops! You know a Sealing Jutsu?!

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.030
It doesn't matter

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.860
if those rods are controlling them or not!

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.070
We'll just tie them up with Ink Clones!

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.190
Sealing Jutsu! Octopus Hold!

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.030
So that's it!

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.730
It's only one of Bee's Sealing Jutsu!

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.480
Just like that and on a count of three…

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:19.980
Namely, in three seconds,

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.190
the ink will completely cover their bodies and harden,

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.900
incapacitating them!

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:27.980
Once they're immobile, we can remove the rods from their chest!

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.730
– One! – One!

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.900
– Two! – Two!

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.320
– Three! – Three!

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.980
That was an amazing sealing…?

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.860
No… It was amazing how the enemy powered up…

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.820
Go…

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.900
That masked bastard!

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.820
He was hiding underground!

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.900
Bug Bite!

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.650
Cat Claws!

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.900
Leech Slip!

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.150
Oww!

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.190
It's a strong alkaline fluid! Your skin's melting!

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.230
Octopops!

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:30.690
Coral Palm!

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.900
What the hell…?!

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.320
Naruto!

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.900
Floral Mountain!

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:46.980
This is bad!

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.980
I didn't realize that these guys could transform

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.110
into Tailed Beasts under these conditions!

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.900
Naruto, retreat for now. We need to regroup!

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.320
Horn Hit!

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.980
I can't move…!

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.730
Bastard!

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.610
Even if you're Jinchuriki,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.780
six against two appears to be bad odds, huh?

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.730
When I touch you, I win!

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.360
This isn't good!

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.070
Uber…Leaf Superhuman Hurricane!

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.030
Using Naruto as bait,

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.900
they waited for the moment I materialized…

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.530
What a nuisance!

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.980
Kakashi Sensei and Bushier Brow Sensei!

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.320
Two more joining the party isn't going to change anything.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.980
Not against my Visual Prowess and power of the Tailed Beasts.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.900
We have Sharingan on our side too.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.320
As well as the Noble Green Beast of the Leaf!

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.530
You came! Kakashi Sensei and Bushier Brow Sensei!

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.280
You know I can't just sit back and relax

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.980
while my student from Team 7 is working hard!

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.190
Oh! Him! He's got a Sharingan and a Rinnegan

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.940
and his left eye and right eye …and…and…!

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.480
Calm down.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.980
I don't understand a word you're saying!

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.440
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Four Tails, the King of Sage Monkeys"

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.110
Naruto, just because we're here doesn't mean you can breathe easy!

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:09.070
FOUR TAILS, THE KING OF SAGE MONKEYS Tune in again!
