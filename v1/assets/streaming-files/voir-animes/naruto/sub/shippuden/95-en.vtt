WEBVTT

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.200
Do you want to end up like this too?

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.470
If you don't talk,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.070
you'll end up living on dragonflies and flies for the rest of your life too.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.770
Turn me into a frog or whatever! I'm not saying anything more!

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.930
Even underlings have pride. I'm a ninja too!

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900
There's nothing I have to say to an outsider

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.600
who knows nothing about our nation!

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.400
Hmm... Still a ninja even if an underling, eh?

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.670
Well... I'm not too keen about interrogation either.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.930
Talk is over. However, you're going to stay right here.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.730
I'll go ask this god of yours in person.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.330
Jiraiya! What's the big idea, summoning me?!

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.930
If it's about the key to Naruto's...

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.470
No, no. It's not about training.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.670
I have my reasons, but I thought of releasing you for the time being.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.000
Release me? What's going on?

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.070
I'm about to fight a pretty tough opponent.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.930
So tough that you needed to release me?

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.570
It's just a precaution.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.330
Anyway, I wish to press the storage release seal now.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.900
Very well.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.870
There!

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.830
How long until you return?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600
I don't think it'll take too long...

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.900
However, if anything happens to me, go store yourself inside Naruto.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.430
Are you crazy?!

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.270
The key that corresponds to Naruto's Eight-Signed Seal

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.170
is transcribed on my belly!

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.370
Each year, the Fourth Hokage's seal weakens!

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.530
The key remains in order to re-seal it when it becomes necessary!

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.730
To place such a key right next to the safe is unheard of!

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.470
Still, Minato entrusted it to us.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.770
It was always meant to be returned to Naruto.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.500
It's too soon!

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.170
Once you talked me into loosening the Tetragram Seal...

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.770
You haven't forgotten what the results were, have you?!

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.030
Yeah...

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.970
However, the fact that Minato left me the jutsu for the key convinces me...

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.600
that he intended for Naruto to perfect that jutsu one day.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.900
That jutsu? Are you serious?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.700
Yes.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.770
Does Naruto even require such a jutsu?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.270
He would never be able to control the Nine-Tails' chakra.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.970
Not only that...

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.370
When that key was loosened, Naruto's own chakra was thrust aside

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.930
and a large amount of the Nine-Tails' chakra leaked out.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.070
The Nine-Tails nearly took control of Naruto.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.630
If the seal weakens any further

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.200
and the Nine-Tails completely overtakes Naruto,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.970
it will be totally against the will of the Fourth Hokage!

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.470
Minato used the Reaper Death Seal only on the Nine-Tails' yin chakra.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.270
He purposely split the Nine-Tails' power into yin and yang,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.670
and sealed the yang power into Naruto.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.200
He wanted to leave the Nine-Tails' chakra to Naruto.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.400
Still...!

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.430
Why did Minato go so far

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.800
as sealing the Nine-Tails' chakra into his own son?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.770
Who knows? Maybe it just turned out that way by coincidence...

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.170
Or perhaps, as a parent, he wanted to pass on the power to his son.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.470
I know because I was Minato's teacher.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.570
Hmm?

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.300
He never did anything without good reason.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.470
Minato must have known something important.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.470
And he entrusted the Nine-Tails' power to his own son because of that.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.400
I think you're reading too much into it.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.700
Do you really think so?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.000
The Nine-Tailed Fox Demon that attacked the Hidden Leaf Village long ago

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.170
is said to have been a natural disaster.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.670
Lately, I've begun to suspect that it wasn't a natural phenomenon.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.000
It may have been manually summoned.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.200
You fool! It has always been known

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.370
that the Nine-Tails is a natural disaster that mysteriously appears

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.830
whenever humanity becomes steeped in evil!

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.570
Besides, there is no one in this world powerful enough

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.930
to summon the likes of the Nine-Tails!

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.930
That's the thing. There was one person.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.970
Huh?!

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.170
Who?

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.400
The founder of the Uchiha Clan...

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.400
Madara Uchiha.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.370
You fool! Madara Uchiha lived during the era

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.130
when the Hidden Leaf Village was established!

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.230
He wouldn't have been alive fifteen, sixteen years ago!

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.900
Indeed.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.330
And everyone knows

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.800
that the First Hokage defeated Madara Uchiha at the Final Valley.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.530
So your theory is pointless.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.900
Perhaps...

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.670
But I just have this feeling...

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.700
that fills me with unease.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.270
You return to the Leaf Village.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.030
When you get there, see Ibiki. He already knows you're coming.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.430
I'm counting on you...

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.670
Now then, I hope this works.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.070
Here I go!

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.500
"The Man Who Became God"

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.500
Well?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.130
It's Jiraiya.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.530
I see... Jiraiya Sensei, huh?

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.430
How nostalgic...

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.100
What'll you do, Pain?

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.770
He's not on our side, right?

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.200
Probably not...

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.300
Then we'll kill him. It's far too late for regrets.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.400
I came forth in this body in order to kill the intruder.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.930
Take me to him.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.930
All right.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.030
Pain... I'll handle him until you arrive.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.130
Kill him if you can.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.770
Fire Style! Flame Bombs!

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.600
Toad Subjugation... Art of the Manipulated Shadow, huh?

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.430
I was hoping to lure out a fellow named Pain,

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.600
but little did I expect you to take the bait.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.670
You've honed your jutsu magnificently.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.030
But even more, you've become quite a catch, Konan!

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.730
I thought you had died...

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.570
Instead, you turned into a flimsy sheet of paper.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.700
You're his messenger... The Lady Angel!

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.400
And now, an angel?

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.300
Which means, Konan,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.400
you're the messenger for this so-called god?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.800
This guy is an intruder!

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.370
You should kill him now!

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.330
Move away.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.630
Y-Yes!

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.200
Who is Pain?

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.070
It's none of your business, Sensei.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.600
And that makes you an angel...?

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.200
Does putting on an act like that have its benefits?

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.070
I have received orders from our god. I will kill you.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.770
Toad Oil Bombs!

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.100
Can't spread your wings with all that oil, can you?

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.000
You used to love origami,

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.830
and you were the kindest among the three kids.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.230
What became of the other two?

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.130
Nagato...and Yahiko?

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.530
I heard they had died. Were they just rumors too?

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.530
I see... So this Pain is one of them, eh?

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.670
What's your purpose?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.830
Appearing before us after all these years...

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.270
That wasn't my intention.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.330
If you all hadn't been part of the Akatsuki...

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:06.200
I heard that you had died. I never expected this.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.230
I bet now you're thinking...

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.270
You should've done what that Orochimaru suggested back then...

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.270
Shall I kill these children?

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.400
Wha--?!

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.300
I've seen many war orphans. It's pitiful.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.230
They would be better off

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.730
if we just put them out of their misery right now...

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.230
You saved us instead.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.200
But it's too late now...

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.870
We've embraced his ideology and made our move.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.600
I don't regret letting you live at all.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.700
But I'm so disappointed...

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.930
I taught you ninjutsu to enable you to live through those harsh times.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.330
You were all, without a doubt, my students.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:13:00.170
The world may still be a cruel place, but to attack me without a greeting...

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.200
This is too sad.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.330
For a few years after that time, I heard your names mentioned.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.030
You had made a reputation for yourselves in a few confrontations,

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.230
but I heard later that you had died.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.770
You know nothing about what happened to us afterwards.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.870
No, I don't. But why the Akatsuki?!

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.200
What the Akatsuki is doing is wrong!

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.730
That is the decision I've made...

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.730
Jiraiya Sensei.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.830
You look very different. But those eyes...

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.700
That shape... That ripple pattern... I can't believe it!

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.370
That eye...

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.570
The Rinnegan...!

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.000
So you were Pain... Nagato!

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.470
It seems you've strayed off the path of good.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.200
What happened?

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.930
You don't need to know. After all, you are an outsider.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.600
You've changed, Nagato.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:14.900
Summoning Jutsu!

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.100
Whoa!

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:30.530
Foam! Leave it to my student to know my weakness!

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.800
He intends to wash away the oil.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.070
Konan, stay back.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.400
Art of the Raging Lion's Mane!

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:09.400
Nagato... I want to ask you a few things.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.370
What happened to Yahiko?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.070
Oh yeah... There was such a guy, wasn't there?

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.330
He died a long time ago.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.070
Nagato... You...?!

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.470
I just want to protect those two.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.500
No matter what kind of pain I have to endure.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.730
I see.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.530
What happened to you? The old you wouldn't...

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.170
Nothing...

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.570
Just war.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:48.630
Too many people die here. That pain made me grow up.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.770
What do you mean?

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.630
Even a stupid, foolish kid will grow up when he learns what pain is.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.570
Knowing pain controls one's words and thoughts.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.600
But abandoning one's love for a friend...

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.830
Is that what it means to become an adult?

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.130
Sensei... You are still just a man.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.970
However, through this never-ending pain...

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.670
I have matured and become even more than a man.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.100
What?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.900
Yes... From a man...

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.670
to a god.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.700
When one becomes a god, your words and thoughts become absolute.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.400
Sensei, since you are human

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.800
it can't be helped if you don't understand what I'm saying.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.100
Have you become that twisted?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.370
Things I couldn't see when I was human are clear to me now that I am a god.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.370
And being a god,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.400
I realize that there are things I can do which man cannot.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.730
To put it simply, evolving beyond man.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.330
Just what are you planning to do?

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.130
I am going to put an end to this senseless, war-torn world.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.870
That is a god's work.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.230
If that is your purpose, why are you gathering Tailed Beasts?

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.030
You are going to die anyway.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.930
So I shall tell you the true purpose.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:21.800
I will use the Sealed Tailed Beasts... to develop a new Forbidden Jutsu.

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.770
With just one such jutsu,

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.430
a large nation can be destroyed instantaneously.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.370
It will be the most powerful, the ultimate Forbidden Jutsu weapon.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:39.130
How will making such a thing end the fighting?

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.730
Won't it simply intensify the conflicts?

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.000
There are disputes throughout the nations.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.730
How would you put a quick end to them all, Jiraiya Sensei?

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.630
That is my question to you! Answer me!

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.430
You give each warring nation a Forbidden Jutsu weapon.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:04.430
Once they possess such a power, they are bound to use it.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.230
What do you mean?

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:11.470
Tens of millions will die instantly...

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.670
and people will become scared.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.100
People...and nations will learn what pain is!

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.600
That fear will breed a strong aversion to war and the fighting will end.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.370
It can be said that this world is still in the process

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.370
of growing and stabilizing.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.200
Pain will make the world mature.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.170
In the same way that I matured.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.630
In order for the world to grow up and become wiser

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.830
a god's hand is necessary.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.530
The world is still a child.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.270
Teach the world pain in order to make it grow up...

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.400
Do you believe that is your work?

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.670
Yes...because I am the god of peace.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.870
You've gotten good at telling jokes...Nagato.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.570
Joke? I'm not joking.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.600
My ideal is...

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.030
Over here, Sensei.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.830
Is that you're next summoning?

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:18.700
To me, you are a small existence which never matured.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.800
Summoning Jutsu!

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.970
A kid treating me like a kid!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.130
Well, I'm no longer human either!

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.230
These tears of blood, overflowing with rage!

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:37.900
I went from the Sannin to Sage! The Monstrous Toad of Mount Myoboku!

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.430
I am Master Jiraiya...!

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.530
You haven't matured at all... You're just as clumsy as before.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:52.970
Hey! Mister Gamaken! Don't jostle around during my juncture!

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.830
I'm kind of clumsy...

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.430
Hmph! Gotta hand it to my former student!

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.000
He knows my moves all too well.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.270
I don't know what happened in the past.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.370
But now he's powerful enough to head the Akatsuki.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.530
Plus he wields the legendary Rinnegan.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.170
Against this foe, there shall be no playing by ear!

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.400
I must go full power with my Sage Mode!

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.870
Next time: "Honored Sage Mode!"

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.570
Look forward to my awesome action!

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.370
Master Jiraiya, when is the new Make-Out Series coming out?

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.300
I've read mine over ten times already.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.070
You still young, aren't you?

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.970
Surely, there are more important things in life?

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.170
What? Is Naruto in trouble again?

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.600
No, just the opposite.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.270
But his power has exceeded all my expectations.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.000
The passing of the torch is just a matter of time.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.300
When it comes to fighting, he learns fast. That's for sure...

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.430
Huh?

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.700
You really turn me on!

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.500
Get lost, you old pervert!

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.470
I'm not giving up!

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.930
That's my Ninja Way!

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.170
Master Jiraiya...

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.970
There's nothing like making out in life!

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.770
Summoning Jutsu!

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.130
I'm going to do some research for my Make-Out Series!

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.630
Take care of the rest!

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:03.570
G-Good luck.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:09.030
Tune in again!
