WEBVTT

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.770
Sasori...

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.900
All right, break's over.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.130
Guy Sensei, are you sure?

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.700
Yeah. I'm totally fine. I woke up completely refreshed.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.300
Neji.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.730
No problem. He has appalling recuperative power.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.400
Uh-huh... So that leaves... I'm ready to go, too.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.830
All right, now to make up for the time we lost resting,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.100
we're going to double the pace.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.170
What?!

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.370
No, let's make it triple.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.330
If we do that, we'll arrive earlier than first planned.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.530
I see.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.770
All right guys,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.400
let's make it quadruple the pace while we're at it.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.200
What's the matter?

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.370
That's impossible, no matter how you consider things.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.500
I told you guys to stop getting so carried away!

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.570
Guy Sensei, that's why I said triple the pace.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.000
Lee, that's a little off, too.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.770
Now then...

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.630
That should be enough rest...

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.770
Break time is over. We should get going.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.170
Wake up, you two. We're leaving.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.030
O-Okay.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.230
A little longer... Let me sleep a little longer.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.770
You're going to save Gaara, aren't you?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.970
Of course I am!

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.330
The Death of Gaara! 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.600
The enemy hideout should be in this direction...

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.070
I'm sorry... Gaara...

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.970
We'll now be entering the final stage.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.870
What shall we do about the pesky flies?

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.200
They're moving at a greater speed than anticipated.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.130
No problem.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.800
We stalled them effectively. Just ignore them.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.500
Besides, we've got some insurance.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.300
In the end, we'll be the ones who have to take care of them.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.870
Let's hurry and finish things up here, Deidara.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.100
We've got guests to greet.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.230
You'll want to catch a breath before that, don't you?

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.670
That's right.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.670
We have welcoming preparations to take care of.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.170
Man, they're sure a pain.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.870
And we're having a hard time finding our Jinchuriki...

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.600
Don't get so irritated.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.830
We just need to take care of our own missions.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.730
That's enough idle chatter.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.630
Concentrate! Mistakes will not be tolerated from here on.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.770
Each team will be deployed as I just announced.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.800
The absence of Lord Kazekage is a highly classified matter!

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.230
However, operate under the assumption

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.070
that the information has already been leaked.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.170
It's conceivable that the nearby lands

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.530
will take advantage of this confusion and execute an attack.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.170
Don't think of this as just an ordinary border patrol.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.800
The teams that are ready will depart at once.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.400
What's the matter, Matsuri?

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.630
Is this really okay?

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.330
Is what okay?

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.030
Lord Gaara has been kidnapped.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.970
And yet, here we are guarding a border

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.400
for an enemy who may or may not come instead of trying to save him.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.470
It's an order from our superiors. We can only obey.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
No way!

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.870
Lord Gaara is the Hidden Sand's...

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.070
our Kazekage!

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.870
I know that! Gaara's my little brother, you know!

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.970
I'm sorry...

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.130
This way.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.000
Right!

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.300
I don't like it.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.300
What is it, Neji?

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.570
Is it an enemy?

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.470
No, just the opposite.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.500
I don't feel any enemy presence at all. That's what's bothering me.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.330
Here they went so far as to use...

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.970
that powerful of a Jutsu in an attempt to stall us.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.970
Then... Could it be...?

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.330
They no longer need to stall us.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.730
I'm saying there's a good chance of that.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.400
Don't tell me...

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.300
H-He's...

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.000
Hang on, Gaara.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.030
Naruto, wait up!

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.070
Geez.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:19.530
Why's that kid trying so hard to save Gaara who's from a different village?

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.930
And what in the world is he?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.330
He's also a Jinchuriki.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.100
He has the Nine-Tail sealed within him.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.700
Indeed, Naruto probably doesn't have much attachment

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.330
to the Hidden Sand itself.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.800
But Gaara is a Jinchuriki Host just like he is.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.300
More than anyone in the Hidden Sand,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.530
Naruto knows how Gaara feels.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:01.700
After all, the Jinchuriki has been treated the same way in every village.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.670
That's exactly why he feels like he has to save Gaara.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.370
It doesn't make any difference to him

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.030
if he's from the Leaf or the Sand.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.730
For Naruto, Gaara is a friend

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.270
who knows the same pain as he does.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.100
Naruto's dream is to become the Hokage.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.500
He was frustrated when he heard that Gaara had become the Kazekage.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.700
I see. So Gaara became the Kazekage, huh?

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.500
But at the same time,

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.230
he was also very happy for Gaara from the bottom of his heart.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.970
I won't be outdone by him!

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.570
I'll become the Hokage, no matter what.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.670
Just you wait, Gaara!

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.770
Naruto has a mysterious power.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:17.170
However small the words he exchanges, he makes friends immediately...

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.800
with everyone he meets.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.700
I myself have lived a long life.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.100
I've seen many things.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.630
And in my own way,

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.470
I've learned the nature of things in this world.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:42.100
Learning that the alliance with other lands were for show only,

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.930
what I did was to create resources to protect the Hidden Sand.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.800
I'm the one who used the Jutsu...

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.400
and forced the possession of the Shukaku on Gaara.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.300
After consulting with his father the Fourth Kazekage, that is.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:12.130
What I did to protect the village ended up just hurting it.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.570
And now a village I avoided because I couldn't believe in alliances

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.130
is trying to help us.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:25.400
Everything I've done might have been mistaken.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.830
And now I've gotten old and learn to give up easily.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.000
Kakashi...

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:41.670
Young people have so much potential within...

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.430
I'm so envious.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.230
Oh no, you're just getting started...

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.900
You're still very much young.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.170
That's right...

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:03.630
There might still be something an old bag like me can do.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.630
Something I can do.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.030
It's about finished.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.830
Whose...hand is this?

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.800
Oh...it's my hand.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:52.600
Have I...become an existence someone needs?

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.970
Huh? What?

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:02.500
Is that me?

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:13.930
That's me... The me who wanted to be needed by...someone...

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.330
Why...? Why did I want to be like that?

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:26.330
Why...am I... an existence that desires that?

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:34.370
Those eyes. That nose. That mouth.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.200
Why?

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.300
Why is that Gaara?

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.270
I was inside that...

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.070
No...

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.000
What am I in the first place?

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.700
I'm just aware that I'm me.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.100
What am I...in the first place?

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.900
I'm just a small...feeling.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.830
It's finished.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.300
Oh man.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.530
In the end, it took three days and three nights.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.070
It's exhausting every time, isn't it?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.800
Ohhh, my shoulders are all stiff.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.170
Good work, everyone.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.800
I've got a bad feeling about this.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.800
Damn it! Isn't there something I can do?

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.500
This is the place, huh?

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.070
Gaara is on the other side of this boulder.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.900
It looks like they put up a barrier.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.700
What's the plan?

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.470
Let's bust through!

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.400
No!

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.700
You're late... Kakashi.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.570
Well, you see...

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.270
We got caught up in something troublesome along the way.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.470
Naruto! Sakura!

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.230
Kakashi...

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.900
By troublesome, you certainly don't mean me, do you?

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.670
Hey!

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.200
Naruto...

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.000
We were just a step behind you guys, huh?

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.530
Who's the old woman there?

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.300
Oh, this is Lady Chiyo, a consultant to the Sand.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.430
Nice to meet you.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.100
Now, shall we do this, Kakashi?

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.670
Yeah.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.730
Hang on, Gaara.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.300
Allow me to explain!

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.730
The title of the next episode is, "Button Hook Entry."

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.870
This refers to a method Ninja used to break through entrances

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.200
by fanning out left and right with the entrance in between.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.530
By the way, it seems a lot of people tend to confuse

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.970
my "Dynamic Entry" as a name for a Jutsu,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
but it's a credited way to break into places.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.070
It's an excellent tactic where speed is of the essence,

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.470
and also serves as an effective diversion!

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:56.570
How about that?!

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.530
Now you're more knowledgeable about our mission!

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.270
Next episode: "Charge Tactic! Button Hook Entry!!"
