WEBVTT

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.200
With that being said, our mission is over.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.780
You're dismissed.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.030
We're done already? But it's only ten in the morning!

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.240
Lately, all of our missions have been so boring!

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.120
When are we gonna get an S-rank mission?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.330
"S-rank"?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.410
A loser like you?

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.740
What are you talking about?

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.200
We're still genin!

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.240
I want something with more pizazz…more oomph!

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.530
Uh, there aren't any.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.530
Okay, dismissed!

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.450
You heard him, Sasuke.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.080
So how about today, just the two of us…

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.200
I'm going home.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.410
Just hold on a minute.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.280
There's only one S-rank mission that we can do.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.450
A mission that's failed numerous times…

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.200
One that only we can pull off…

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.370
…to see what Kakashi Sensei's face really looks like!

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.660
Let's find out what the best-kept secret about our target is!

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.380
A SPECIAL MISSION

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.050
Why are you trying to act like you know what you're saying? A SPECIAL MISSION

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.260
Just forget about that already.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.760
Right, Sasuke?

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.550
This is the perfect mission for a day like today.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.220
I couldn't agree more!

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.010
INNER SAKURA I got tricked!

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.510
INNER SAKURA Cha!

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.880
But what do we do?

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.090
Every time we try, it never goes well.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.930
I already have a plan!

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.010
What is it?

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.180
Photos!

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.130
If we go through every single photo Kakashi Sensei is in,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.300
there's bound to be at least one…

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.050
I never told you this, but I already checked once before.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.590
He has a mask on in every one.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.590
The photo submitted to the Hokage for the Ninja Registration Form…

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.300
…should be one of him without a mask.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.010
But it's an extremely classified, top-secret document…

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.760
Accessing it would be no easy task.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.180
He overheard us!

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.430
Who cares if he overheard us or not?!

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.130
Who are you?

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.800
I'm Sukea, a photographer.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.840
I travel to the east and west looking for scoops.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.090
What about north and south?

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.260
Naruto!

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.680
You've been getting hung up on insignificant details since earlier!

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.630
Anyways, I was searching around for a scoop

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.180
and happened to overhear an interesting conversation…

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.090
He did hear us! Should we get rid of him?!

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.590
You idiot!

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.090
Ouch!

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.720
He's right.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.380
There's a rule that the photo for the Ninja Registration Form

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.760
must be of your entire face.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.260
It's so obvious, we didn't even think about looking there.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.760
Will you let me join you in this adventure?

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.010
What's your motive?

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.090
If I'm able to capture this Kakashi guy without a mask,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.470
I'll have the biggest scoop since the Hidden Leaf was established.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.760
Even if it's hushed up, I'm sure to make a lot of money out of this.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.300
Hey! Hey!

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.430
When you get the money, you have to treat us to ramen! Promise?

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.970
I'll even throw in some dumplings.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.300
So it's settled then?

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.470
This is getting interesting…

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.800
Oh, you guys…

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.760
INNER SAKURA I'm getting kind of excited for this!

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.930
Secret documents are stored here…

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.590
This is an infiltration mission…

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.220
Mr. Sukea, will you be able to keep up?

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.930
Before I started taking pictures, I was a rank-and-file ninja…

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.260
All right! Let's begin the mission!

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.760
Not done yet, Sasuke?!

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.220
Shut up… Wait!

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.800
Can we switch?

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.590
It opened! Wow!

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.930
Sukea…

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.430
What division did you belong to?

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.510
The Intel Unit that reported directly to Lord Hokage.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.260
That's the…

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.970
ANBU Black Ops.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.050
Things happened and now I'm retired.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.880
Considering your past, is it wise for you to be doing this?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.760
You'll be targeted by the ANBU.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.550
Don't worry about it. C'mon, let's go.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.300
We have to search in all of these?

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.430
Let's hurry.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.050
Found it! This is it!

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.380
Okay, let's open it.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.680
The moment is finally here!

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.840
REGISTRATION FORM

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.220
REGISTRATION FORM

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.260
REGISTRATION FORM

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.260
Don't move!

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.130
We're taking you in.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.130
Make a move and we'll take that as resistance…

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.880
Depending on the situation we may have to take you down.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.970
I-I feel like I'm going to sneeze.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.300
Idiot! Hold it in!

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.680
Damn it…we were so close!

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.430
FIRE

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.180
Really? An infiltration mission?

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.880
I'm so sorry… I tried to stop them, but they insisted…

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.970
Huh?! What a jerk!

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.130
So you planned on blaming us from the start if this failed?!

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.880
They wanted to see what you really looked like…

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.590
You're a former ANBU Black Ops, aren't you?

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.220
Honestly! Who cares what I really look like?!

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.880
You've got some nerve blaming us!

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.720
I thought it was strange.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.720
You're skilled, and you're a former ANBU.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.800
You could've done this alone.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.470
I can't stand guys who are handsome, but do nasty things.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.180
Sorry! Sorry!

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.760
I'll make it up to you by helping you photograph Kakashi Sensei's face.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.010
This time with my photography skills.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.050
What? You're still gonna do this?

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.760
Why? You're already giving up?

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.130
What's your plan?

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.260
Let's go for Kakashi himself.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.590
We'll lure him out to a meal, then photograph him while he eats.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.720
We tried many times and failed.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.630
Every time, at the very moment we have a chance to see his face,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.220
we get interrupted.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.470
With this multi-exposure camera I built,

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.380
we should get at least one photo.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.010
SWEET CHESTNUTS

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.590
Sensei! I need to talk to you about something very important, ya know?!

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.300
What is it?

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.300
Well, why don't we eat some dumplings while we talk?

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.220
I'm ready!

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.930
All right, I'm gonna take you up on your offer!

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.180
Hey, Naruto!

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.050
Were you guys out taking a stroll too?

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.050
Don't bother us! We're doing something really important!

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.180
What is it?

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.130
I'm about to find out.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.800
He already ate it?!

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.840
But this time, we got you on camera!

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.090
This is…impossible…

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.930
You're kidding… Not a single one?

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.180
I feel like some divine power is at work here.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.220
I guess this means…

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.220
the mission is over and dismissed, huh?

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.760
I guess I'll be…

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.430
Hey, Naruto!

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.340
What are you guys up to?

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.220
Kiba… And everyone!

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.820
MAKEOUT PARADISE

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.400
Kakashi Sensei!

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.820
P-Perfect timing!

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.190
U-Um… O-Over there…

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.440
What's wrong? Calm down and tell me.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.650
A woman's drowned… O-Over there by the river… What?!

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.400
This isn't good. Her pulse is weak.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.360
Good job, Sakura!

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.780
Her medicine's even fooled Kakashi Sensei!

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.780
This calls for…

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.320
He definitely has to take his mask off now!

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.150
This woman's in danger! We can't waste any time!

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.190
We have to get her to the hospital!

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.280
Plan A…failed.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.860
Understood. Everyone, switch to Plan B.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.320
Mr. Sukea, please get into position as well.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.650
Roger.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.190
All right, he's coming!

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.230
Just as Shikamaru predicted,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.570
he's gonna pass this way to the hospital.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.320
Everyone get in position!

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.820
Expansion Jutsu!

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.150
Human Boulder! Roll! Roll! Roll!

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.940
What're you doing?! We have to get her to…

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.480
Go!

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.280
Hidden Jutsu! Beetle Sphere!

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.820
Now!

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.360
3…2…1

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.190
Now!

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.280
Scatter!

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.860
Mind Transmission Jutsu!

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.530
Look, you guys…

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.150
I get that you want to see what I look like,

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.530
but think of the situation at hand here!

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.320
She needs to get to the hospital ASAP!

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.070
Shadow Possession Jutsu!

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.230
Complete!

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.150
Do it now, Sukea!

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.360
It finally worked, Naruto.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.530
You can have ramen and dumplings now!

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.780
Hey guys, the plan worked!

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.900
Finally… You guys should all be grateful to us.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.900
That's because—

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.730
Okay, Kakashi Sensei… Get ready!

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.190
Do it, Shikamaru!

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.230
It's time for the unveiling.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.150
Wait, wait, you guys.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.110
Let's just talk things over.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.190
H-Hey! Stop! Stop!

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.690
C-Calm down!

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.320
Keeping this a mystery makes it more alluring, don't you think?

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.980
Ramen and dumplings at Ichiraku sound way more alluring to me.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.440
So you were bribed!

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.730
Checkmate!

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.570
Hey! Wait! I mean, please wait!

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.650
You're being annoying, Lee!

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.900
Please spar with me!

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.980
Neji!

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.730
What? Don't interfere!

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.110
Enough is enough, you two!

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.110
Hey! Wait!

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.570
Sorry!

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.030
Ouch!

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.030
A S-Shadow Clone?

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.780
What's the hell is going on?

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.030
Does this mean Kakashi Sensei was on to us from the very beginning?

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.320
It was too bad… But I'm really grateful to all of you.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.730
Nah… Thanks to you Sukea, we had a great time!

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.320
Thank you!

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.190
I'd better get going.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.190
Let's team up again if something comes up.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.030
Hope you get your scoop!

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.530
They really seem like they're having fun!

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.360
It was sheer coincidence that Kiba came to the dumpling shop…

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.190
But who would have thought everyone would team up.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.360
But something like this is good, once in a while.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.730
But it really wears me out…

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.440
…using this many Clones and Transformations.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.480
It was a close call with my mask… because of everyone's teamwork.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.530
Even if they got the mask, it's no harm done.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.280
Because I'm wearing a back-up mask underneath.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.030
Food is the best way!

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.610
That has the highest probability…

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:09.320
But the problem is, how do we get Kakashi Sensei to eat with us.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.480
Bad timing! They're coming this way!

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.190
Hey!

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.480
Excuse me,

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.230
but did you notice any kind of trouble going on around here?

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.780
Huh? No, there wasn't anything…

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.110
Kakashi…

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.570
I heard him and his team were making a commotion all around town.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.610
Sorry for stopping you.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.230
N-No problem.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.150
Hey.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.230
Uh, can I help you?

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.570
Don't I know you from somewhere?

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.480
N-No… I don't think so…

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.440
Really? Well, excuse me. Later!

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.230
I could have sworn I've met him before…

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.360
Changing your voice really puts a strain on the throat.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.820
RENTAL AGREEMENT

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.190
It turned out to be a good mission after all…

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.280
Their teamwork's gotten much better than it was

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.980
during the bell-snatching mission.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.820
Oh well…

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.030
I can probably only keep this up for about two or three more attempts…

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.760
I can't use a pervy move to distract her anymore.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.760
So I gotta go back to the basics

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.590
…and corner her!

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.590
If she tries to escape through that weird window again,

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.590
I'll enter it with her.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.930
That's where I'll look for Sasuke!

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.470
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Connecting Thoughts"

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:14.010
I can still sense Sasuke's chakra clearly!

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:35.760
CONNECTING THOUGHTS Tune in again!
