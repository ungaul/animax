00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.200
Yahiko died...

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.130
And from then on, I took over as the leader of our organization.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.600
Since that day, countless comrades fought and died.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.030
One by one... One after another...

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.000
They continued to die.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.870
The peace-addled citizens of the Land of Fire...

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.970
The small commissions they pay to the Hidden Leaf become war funds.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.330
The Land of Fire is fully aware of having taken part in war,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.930
yet they falsely proclaim peace.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.000
The peace you great nations enjoy only exists precariously

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.830
atop the sacrifices of us small nations.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.600
To us, your peace means violence.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.470
Just by living, people hurt others without even realizing it.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.930
So long as humanity exists, hate will also exist.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.370
True peace cannot exist in this cursed world.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.030
Everything Jiraiya Sensei said is wishful thinking!

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.830
I have told you my story.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.970
Now let me hear your answer.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.810
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.900
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.320
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.240
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.040
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.340
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.550
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.180
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:48.810
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.810
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.980
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo
Even in a world without you, I run.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.200
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.700
koete Someday...

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.370
Tale of Naruto Uzumaki

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.370
I have told you my story.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.770
Now let me hear your answer.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.070
TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.230
But I have faith that there will come a time

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.500
when people can truly understand one another.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.000
You may be right.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.670
I also think the same way.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.270
I see...

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.530
I get where you're coming from now.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.630
But I still... can't forgive you.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.100
I still hate you.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.900
Then you want to settle this?

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.430
But...

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.730
Pervy Sage believed in me, and left me his quest.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.070
So I'm gonna believe in Pervy Sage's belief.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.700
That's my answer.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.130
So...I won't kill you guys.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.400
You'll believe in what Jiraiya Sensei believed?

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.270
I see.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.770
So that's your answer.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.200
And do you expect us to wait...

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.100
until you make this world a peaceful place?

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.370
Don't play with me!

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.670
It's far too late for me to believe Jiraiya's words!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.630
There's no such thing as true peace!

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.700
As long as we live in this cursed world

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.770
peace is impossible!

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.600
Then...

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.130
Then...I'll break that curse.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.430
If there is such a thing as peace, I'll seize it!

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.270
I'll never give up!

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.170
You...

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.370
That's...

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.830
Nagato? What's wrong?

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.000
Those...words...

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.300
That's right.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.230
They're taken straight from this book.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.430
The first novel written by Pervy Sage.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.730
Pervy Sage was seriously trying to change the world with this.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.770
At the end of this book, he wrote about a student

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.430
who helped provide him with inspiration.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.670
It was you, Nagato.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.600
No...

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.730
Sensei...

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.770
What's the matter?

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.700
Is this a good time?

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.900
Sure... I was trying to start on my book,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.600
but I can't come up with any ideas.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.830
I figured I'd take a break and get a bite to eat.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.500
So? What's going on?

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.700
About what you once said to me about the hatred in this world...

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.730
I've been thinking about it.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.370
Oh yeah? Have you figured anything out?

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.470
Peace...

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.100
I don't know how to achieve peace yet.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.000
But...

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.100
Some day, I'll break this curse.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.670
If there is such a thing as peace, I'll seize it!

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.830
There's something more important than the method.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.470
It's the power to believe in it!

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.100
I see... That's an excellent thought.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.400
You may very well be correct.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.000
What is it?

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.130
Thanks to you, I think I'll be able to write a fine novel!

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.730
Now then...

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.000
First, I've got to come up with a name for the hero.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.170
Now I can return to my village without any worries.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.370
You are on your own from now on.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.430
You've done well these past three years!

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.930
Don't cry, Yahiko.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.930
Or people will call you a coward.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.330
Konan... You're gonna grow up to be a beauty.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.300
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.900
This is a poor land.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.400
And there's more sadness and tough times up ahead.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.170
But now, you have the strength to change this land.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:30.630
Nagato... You three have grown up. Don't you agree?

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.000
Thank you, Sensei.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.070
Come on, stop crying Yahiko.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.130
I'm sure we'll see him again someday.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.170
Sensei...

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.000
Why don't you give it up?

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.300
This game of tag is getting boring.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.830
A Smoke Bomb?

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.300
Give it up.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.330
Can I say one thing?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.600
I don't care to listen!

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.130
Die already!

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.470
Give up...

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.070
on me giving up!

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.430
Even if you bring me down,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.730
another assassin will attack the village.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.530
As long as we are cursed to live in the Ninja World,

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.500
there will be no peace.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.870
Then... I'll break that curse!

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.230
If there is such a thing as peace, I'll seize it!

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.530
I'll never give up!

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.070
Wh-Who are you?

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.670
My name is...

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.670
My name is...

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:49.330
Maybe you are the reincarnation of that monk.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.570
I have a feeling that those eyes of yours

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.470
have been entrusted with the monk's hopes.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.330
A certain sage gave me a prophecy...

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.500
That one of my students will bring about a great change

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.330
in the Ninja World.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.130
And I will guide that revolutionary.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:16.870
I believe you are that person. And I also believe in you.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.730
You are the savior of this world.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.370
I know...you can do it.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.430
It's the power to believe in it!

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.700
Amazing, Yahiko!

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.030
What a huge catch, I'm impressed!

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.930
Awesome, huh?

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.000
It tastes great, doesn't it Nagato?

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.500
Uh-huh. It's great.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.930
That looks tasty, Mother.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.370
Now eat up, Nagato.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.570
Okay.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.300
Rather than rule the world through pain...

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.230
I wish you had moved past the pain

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.930
and harnessed your power to bring about peace in a positive way.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:21.400
So I'm gonna believe in Pervy Sage's belief.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.630
And...the name of the hero in this novel...

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.770
His name is...

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.200
Then I'll break that curse.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.400
If there is such a thing as peace, I'll seize it!

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.670
I'll never give up!

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.230
Wh-Who are you?

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.500
My name is...

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.670
Naruto!

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.400
The name of the hero in this novel...

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.570
is Naruto!

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:20.300
My name is a precious keepsake from Pervy Sage!

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.700
I cannot just give up and stain my master's keepsake!

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.370
I will be the Hokage!

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.770
And I will bring peace to the Hidden Rain!

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.670
Please believe in me!

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.070
How?

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.800
How can you say that you will never change?

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.800
That you will not change

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.470
no matter how great the pain you face.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.970
Can you continue believing in yourself?

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.670
Can you guarantee it?

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.200
Can you have such faith in yourself?

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.430
I've experienced pain too...

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.770
And there's a lot of pain nesting inside of me as well.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:55.030
There's no telling what kind of pain will come after me.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.930
But...

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.530
TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA If I stop believing because of that...

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.830
If the hero should change

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.900
it'll turn into another story.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.270
It'll turn into a different story from the one my master left behind.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.430
Then it won't be Naruto!

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.500
I can't write novels like my master did.

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:30.600
That's why...the sequel has to come from the life I live.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.730
No matter how great the pain, I'll continue walking.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.700
Because that's who Naruto is!

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:46.430
If the hero changes, it'll turn into a different story.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.930
You and I are sibling disciples.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.070
As students of the same master,

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.130
we ought to be able to understand one another.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.530
That is what I said to you earlier.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.430
I meant it as a joke.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.630
You are a curious fellow.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.970
You remind me of how I once was.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.100
Nagato...

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.800
I wasn't able to believe in Jiraiya.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.130
Nor...could I believe in myself.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:26.430
However...

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.400
I have a feeling that, unlike me,

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.270
you will walk towards a different future.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:45.330
I think I shall believe in you... Naruto Uzumaki.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.970
Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.330
Nagato don't!

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.130
Konan... It's okay.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.070
I am making a new decision.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.530
A decision I had once given up on.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.630
What is it? What kind of jutsu is that?

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.700
Those who possess the Rinnegan are able to manipulate

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.800
the jutsu of all six Pains,

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.570
and are said to exist outside the realm of life and death.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.470
Nagato's ocular power is the jutsu that controls life and death.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.170
He is the seventh Pain.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.530
Gedo...

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.030
If he performs the jutsu at his current chakra level...

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.770
Nagato will not survive.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.730
He is willing to go that far for this child...

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.600
This mysterious child has changed Nagato.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.170
It appears to have ended.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.330
How did it turn out?

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.970
It is as my vision foretold.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.300
Although I never thought two of Jiraiya's students

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.600
would cross each other's paths as the Child of Prophecy.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.030
Both becoming the ones to bring about a great change to the Ninja World.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:49.730
Perhaps in that moment when Jiraiya chose not to give up,

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.330
all this became preordained.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:01.000
That book really became the key to changing the world.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:16.500
When the fireworks suddenly explode in the air...
fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:22.000
I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face...
muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:31.220
sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly...

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:47.070
It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you...
kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:53.450
Because I always remember you, in situations like this...
kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto

00:21:53.810 --> 00:22:00.580
I can't help but think about the times we spent together.
mata omoidashiteshimau yo

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:10.050
I'm ready to forget you...
mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.180
It just tears at my heart too much.
konna ni mo kanashikute

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:21.350
I wonder... why did we meet each other?

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:25.110
doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes...

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:33.400
me wo tojireba It's like you are here.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:33.400
ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.230
Iruka Sensei!

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.530
Konohamaru! You're alive.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.100
You too, Sensei!

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.130
Ebisu Sensei, are you hurt?

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:45.870
This is nothing.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.830
Konohamaru saved me.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.570
But never mind that.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.400
What is this phenomenon?

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.400
Yes... What's going on?

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:59.070
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Hero of the Hidden Leaf"

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.500
What just happened?

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.130
Tune in again!
