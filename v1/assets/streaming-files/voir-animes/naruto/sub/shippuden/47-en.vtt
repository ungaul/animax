00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.200
What's up with...this picture?

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.600
This is a strange picture.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.170
In this picture book...

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.630
only the facing pages in the middle are incomplete...

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.500
This is...kind of creepy...

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.370
Naruto!

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.570
This time for sure... we'll save Sasuke!

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.930
Right!

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.600
You're late.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.230
Weren't you supposed to join me

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.800
for some new Jutsu training this afternoon, Orochimaru?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.630
Talking rude like that again...

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.430
Don't get so angry.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.600
Instead, I got a little present for you today...

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.170
This is a Shinobi from the Leaf, just like you...

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.600
You guys should be able to exchange...

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.500
nostalgic stories of home, right?

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.370
Sasuke... Uchiha...

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.600
Infiltration: The Den of the Snake! 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.370
How do you do? My name is Sai.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.600
So you're Sasuke Uchiha--?

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.730
Get lost.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.170
It seems I'm the type of person people don't like one way or another...

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.530
even if I try to make a smile...

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.770
Just recently,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.830
Naruto also expressed his dislike towards me...

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.530
But I get the feeling I'll be able...

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.330
to get along better with you compared to Naruto.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.000
Sasuke!

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.870
I'm sweating...?

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.170
I don't feel anything... and I have no emotions.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.270
Yet just by looking into Sasuke's eyes...

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.900
I feared him within the depths of my soul that even I can't perceive?

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.700
It's probably not a good idea...

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.570
to joke around with Sasuke too much.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.970
He's even more troublesome than I am, you see.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.870
I don't care about that guy.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.570
Join me right now... Orochimaru.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.600
I've heard a lot about you from Naruto.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.030
It seems he was looking for you over the last three years...

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.770
There used to be a guy like that...wasn't there?

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.970
Let's go, Orochimaru.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.700
Naruto said he thinks of you like...

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.600
He thinks of you like a real brother...

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.400
That's what I heard from Sakura.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:48.100
I only have...one brother... the man I want to kill.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.370
Okay, I'll be going, too.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.170
Kabuto... make a Bingo Book using this.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.030
Yes, sir.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.530
Then, I leave the rest to you.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.030
What's this?

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.630
A copy of the list of Anbu Black Ops members...

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.470
under the direct command of the Hokage...?

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.000
It looks like the real thing.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.200
This is the place, huh...?

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.100
The entrance is straight ahead beneath that rocky area.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.000
Could it be that...

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.630
Sasuke's under there...?

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.770
There's a good possibility.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.030
At the very least, there should be clues of some kind.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.770
All right! Let's go!

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.370
Just a minute.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.500
Go after you swallow this, Naruto.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.670
It's okay! You don't need to worry.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.200
Here. You, too, Sakura.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.230
Now even if we get separated,

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.130
I'll know where you guys are right away.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.430
N-No way!

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.730
Seriously?!

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.630
What is this?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.030
Stated simply, this seed is a transmitter used for tracking.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.470
It's a Ninja Tool that resonates only with my Chakra.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.600
It's the same thing I placed in Sai's clothing and food.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.700
In Sai's clothing...and food?

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.430
This seed...

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.000
I get it. That's how you were able to track him this far.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.130
When did you do that, Captain Yamato?

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.170
Do you remember when I got out of the hot spring first?

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.830
Come to think of it...

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.070
I'm getting out now.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.070
You certainly did get out first!

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.570
Now you know why

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.500
I went to the trouble of letting you guys enjoy...

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:06.600
the hot springs and magnificent food at my expense, right?

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.570
It wasn't just to improve our rapport, huh?

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.400
And Lady Tsunade told me...

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.230
to take particular caution in regards to Sai.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.030
An additional member...

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.830
a new recruit from the Anbu Black Ops Training Division...

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.600
will be dispatched to Team Kakashi...

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.200
However...

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.400
What is it?

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.370
Keep a close watch on his actions...

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.030
And she was right.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.570
Wow!

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.930
Man, it sure looks good...

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.730
I'm glad I took care of things ahead of time.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.600
But never mind that. Swallow that quickly.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:16.970
Got it!

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.570
All right! Let's get going, you two.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.030
- Okay! - Right!

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.070
Excuse me... Hmm?

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.700
I would like to say hello

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.630
to all the others here in this hideout.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.000
That won't be necessary.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.830
To be precise, you can't right now.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.700
This is because the only subordinates here...

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.570
right now are Sasuke and myself.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.170
I can barely feel the presence of anyone.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.830
I think it's safe to assume there are not that many enemies at all.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.930
Even so, make sure you don't let your guard down!

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.130
Our opponent is Orochimaru,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.200
and we can assume that Sai has defected to the enemy's side.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.030
The formation for infiltration will be in the following order:

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.830
me, Sakura, and Naruto.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.100
How will we infiltrate?

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.400
We'll go by the book...

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.270
and infiltrate from underground using Earth Style.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.930
First, we'll open up a pit in this area.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.430
And then, once we've made a degree of progress digging...

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.470
we'll move forward little by little by digging a tunnel...

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.170
heading for that rocky area where the entrance is.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:51.800
Right!

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.130
Okay, understood.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.230
Okay, let's begin.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.000
When I give the signal, come down in order!

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.670
Okay, here we go!

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.430
Let's go, Naruto!

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:23.970
Right!

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.100
We finally did it...

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.930
We found you.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.200
Okay, come on inside...

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.400
This is your room.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.430
Sorry about this place being so dull with nothing in it.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.070
The bathroom is in the back.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.130
When you don't have anything to do...

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.000
stay in here nice and quiet.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.900
We'll let you know from our end if something comes up.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.170
Sorry, but I'll be locking the door from the outside for now.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.630
After all, you're... You know, right?

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.230
It appears the hideout...

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.830
is surrounded by rocks, just as I thought...

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.030
I'll smash this thing right away! With my Rasengan!

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.330
Just a minute!

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.400
The enemy will notice us immediately if you use a big Jutsu like that!

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.370
Infiltration must be done quietly all the way...

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.070
But how do we do that...?

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.570
Here it is!

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.330
The harder the rock...

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:07.100
by applying just a little force to a small crack...

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.870
Look, just like this.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.330
Wow!

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.930
Now, please limit your use of Chakra from here on.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.770
Orochimaru will notice that we're here, after all.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.600
Okay, let's go.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.330
A successful infiltration, more or less.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.670
First, we need to find Sai.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:53.530
This way.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.230
Now then, if I don't get right to making the Bingo Book...

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.670
Master Orochimaru will scold me again.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.400
He'll probably tell me people with A type blood...

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.200
are better suited to be subordinates if I do stuff like this.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.630
Clear. Let's go.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.230
We're almost there...

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.630
In the Foundation,

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.370
there were many who came from broken families...

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.600
brought about by battle.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.700
My older brother was one of those with whom I became close,

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.770
like a real brother.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.730
I was planning on giving him this picture book.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.670
But ever since that day, I haven't been able to remember...

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.270
what picture I was going to draw for the final facing pages.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.100
The picture I wanted to show him the most.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.970
Next time: "Bonds."
