WEBVTT

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.650
There it is!

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.440
Huh? Wasn't this an island?

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.400
How come it's connected to land?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400
Minor stuff you don't need to know…

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.530
Now, are ya ready? 'Cuz here we go.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.400
Attack of the Gedo Statue

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.820
I'm bored with playing cards.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.480
How else can we amuse ourselves?

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.900
We have no choice.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.480
Found them!

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.110
This is it!

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.980
So before I can get the Feudal Lords,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.730
I have to get through you first, huh.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.900
Get through us.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.110
It's noisy outside.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.110
How am I supposed to concentrate?

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.530
Lava Style!

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.530
Chojuro…

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.530
I won't let you…!

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.230
The Eight and Nine Tails' chakra!

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.730
They've appeared at last!

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.820
I must send word.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.780
Looks like the Eight Tails and Nine Tails have appeared.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.530
So the Eight Tails and Nine Tails are out.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.650
But what about the Feudal Lords?

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.480
We should capture them to use as bargaining chips, right?

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.110
No, we don't need the Feudal Lords anymore.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.110
If we capture them,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.570
the nations would pressure the Allied Shinobi Forces.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.570
But from the very beginning, those lords were mere tools

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.360
to lure the Eight and Nine Tails out.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.400
Now that the Eight and Nine Tails have emerged,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.400
there's no need for indirect measures.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.480
We're dealing with the Raikage.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.730
He's aware that in this war, the Feudal Lords have no value.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.570
If Project Tsuki no Me succeeds, it's all over.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.690
What, really?

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.110
So Black Zetsu is fighting Mizukage for nothing?

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.610
No. Shinobi still cannot disregard the Feudal Lords who hired them.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.730
Tell Black Zetsu to continue his guerilla assault.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.530
By stalling the Mizukage and her men there,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.070
we'll be able split up the enemy's battle strength.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.650
You're right.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.480
And what about you, Tobi?

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.280
It's finally time for me to join the battle.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.360
First, I'm going to steal the substitute.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.730
– Ninja Art! – Ninja Art!

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.190
– Four Flames Formation! – Four Flames Formation!

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.530
Well done!

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.030
Once inside this barrier,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.230
even those controlled by the Reanimation Jutsu are helpless.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.360
Yes…

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.400
Right.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.480
This is…

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.150
the last one!

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.320
I'm dying. Help me…

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.030
You used too much chakra.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.610
Don't use this Ninja Tool anymore!

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.570
But, I'm so good with it.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.860
Thanks, big guy from the Leaf!

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.280
It's far from over.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.860
This is just…the beginning.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.440
That's some assessment.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.440
We're the victors here.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.940
We've defended the coastline to the end.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.940
Your amphibious operation is a failure.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.650
Summoning Jutsu!

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.070
Y-You're… No way!

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.860
What is that?!

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.610
It's bigger than Choji.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.440
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.860
I-It's not just big…

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.570
That's some assessment on your part too.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.940
Come! Choji!

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.730
Please deal with Kakuzu and Hizashi!

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.480
I'll handle that one!

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.400
Sealing Corps!

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.070
Go, Gedo Statue!

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.530
It's there, eh…

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.480
Choza… Dad!

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.440
Yeah!

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.230
Now, Choji!

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.480
He stopped me?!

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.820
What happened?

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.690
What's happening up there?!

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.280
Now then…

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.820
Incredible chakra!

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.440
An immense chakra field has appeared on the battlefield

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.030
near Darui's First company!

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.980
What is it?!

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.780
We reached the First Company.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.480
It appears to be some sort of humanoid monster!

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.440
And it seems to be controlled by… Who is it?!

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.730
We believe it's Madara Uchiha.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.150
If that's true, we must revise our battle strategy.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.530
The leader joined the battle?

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.440
For what reason?

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.780
We don't have enough data for an assessment.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.030
Naruto, preserve that mode for the fight ahead.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:27.230
Use up your strength, and you'll end up seeing red.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.570
I can't waste anymore time!

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.650
Incoming message!

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.860
Killer Bee and Naruto have both broken through the barrier,

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.400
and escaped.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.690
What?!

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.480
That barrier is supposed to be impenetrable, even to Jinchuriki!

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.480
No one foresaw two Jinchuriki coordinating an escape!

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.480
Two of them?!

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.530
It seems Master Bee is helping out.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.110
Damn!

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.530
Now what are they up to?

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.690
I will personally stop the Jinchuriki.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.980
Tsunade, you come too!

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.440
Who will manage Headquarters?

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.030
Shikaku of the Leaf!

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.900
Understood.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.110
You can leave this to me.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.530
All right! Follow me, Tsunade!

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.070
Lord Raikage!

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.820
Please don't break down any walls.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.400
Let's go.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.070
Oh…right.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.570
I can't believe this.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:48.730
Get back!

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.030
Everyone, retreat to the coastline!

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.570
Earth Style! Mountain Jutsu!

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.480
What is that thing?

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:30.190
What power… It's extraordinary!

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.480
Taking into consideration all the data gathered so far,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.320
and the data Temari of the Sand gave to the Allied Forces Council,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.530
I wonder if that's…

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:47.730
According to the Kazekage's intel, a Jinchuriki's powers are sealed

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.110
inside a giant humanoid statue used for the ritual.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.440
Bee's octopus leg clone most likely has been absorbed into it.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.440
A humanoid monster…

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.820
Don't tell that's it?!

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.480
My reserved special move had no effect at all.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.400
Sealing the Jinchuriki powers into that thing…

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.150
means…

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.570
Why you—!

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.610
Damn it!

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.070
You can't have that Ninja Tool!

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.530
I don't want the Ninja Tool!

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.400
I want what's inside.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.860
I'll return the Ninja Tool later.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.650
If you want it that badly.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.900
You took advantage of the Gold and Silver Brothers,

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.400
who possess the Nine Tails' chakra, by utilizing them on the frontlines.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.400
Now that you're through with them,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.610
you want to seal their chakra inside that monstrosity…

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.730
Seems the Allied Forces have a shrewd one in their midst.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:08.900
Am I wrong?

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.980
What a shame that you're my enemy.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.690
Don't tell me that giant is… No way…

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.730
Damn it!

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.230
Shikamaru?!

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.320
Are you all right, Shikamaru?

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.820
You're a lifesaver, Choji!

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.230
Sorry to bother you twice.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:54.860
Don't stress over it.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.610
I apologize.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.980
So what happened to him?

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.280
He disappeared with the Ninja Tool.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:18.820
They retreated?

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.980
Choza, seal me!

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.360
Hurry… Hurry and seal me!

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.480
Don't be afraid! Surround him!

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.570
The tide of the war has suddenly changed in their favor.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.480
Darui, we must contact HQ secretly and regroup.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.070
I know.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.400
It's almost dark.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.230
We have to be prepared for a night invasion and keep our eyes open.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.570
Losing this war is not an option.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.690
Make no doubt about it.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.320
My long-standing desire… Project Tsuki no Me…

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.820
shall be realized tomorrow, at long last…

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.320
He's already sealed Kinkaku and Ginkaku?

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.690
He only has part of the Eight Tail's chakra…

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.650
one part of his tentacles.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.320
I think you're rushing into this,

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.570
but I'll go along with your plans tonight…

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:29.730
while I keep some of my pieces in reserve.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.690
Good work, Sai.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.190
Get as much rest as you can.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.400
Kakashi…

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:09.980
All right!

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.570
Those who are fit for guard duty, gather around!

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:15.780
I can't see the enemy.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.400
What'll we do?

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.980
Retreat? Or advance?

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.280
Right now, this company is without captains.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.860
We'll just have to stand our ground and wait for orders.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.480
Luckily, we have a bunch of Sensory-Type ninja…

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.860
who are ideal for this.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.150
They're not coming…

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.030
I don't sense anything in the sand either.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.730
We can safely assume they've retreated.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.690
I should think the wiser move with the Reanimation

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.530
is to keep raising the dead and fight hard.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.610
So are you saying they have a better plan than that?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.480
Lord Gaara, please use this!

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.650
You must conserve your strength.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.650
Give that to him first.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.530
Huh? To this puny old man?

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.900
I am the Tsuchikage.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.530
– Huh?! – Huh?!

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.940
We have no idea what they may be planning in the dark of night.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.820
Stay on guard at all times.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.150
– Yes, sire! – Yes, sire!

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.440
Where is my Ninja Tool?!

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.940
I want it back!

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.860
You were told not to use it anymore!

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.860
I don't want to!

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.400
I'm really good with it!

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.480
It's such a waste!

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.400
I notified HQ that Madara has taken a Treasured Tool.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.480
And that he got the Tailed Beast's chakra.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.900
I'm very sorry. This was my fault.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.480
If only we had realized it sooner…

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.480
No, you responded well.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.480
It can't be helped that he was unstoppable.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.570
In any case, we were able to repel the enemy for one more day.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.230
Nearly 40,000 out of 80,000.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.610
That's how many the Allied Shinobi Forces lost today.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.440
50,000 out of 100,000.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.570
That's how many Akatsuki we got today.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.820
Each side lost nearly half its force.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.860
But our side consists of living flesh.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.530
While the enemy…

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.230
I'm coming now, everyone!

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.900
Sasuke, who used to be with you,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.400
has been gripped by hatred for a long time.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.900
Have you ever been able to do anything for him?

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.320
Ever since that day…

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.610
That's right, you've known it ever since that day.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.980
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Unison Sign"

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:05.280
Ya know, Nine Tails, I… UNISON SIGN UNISON SIGN

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.320
Tune in again!
