WEBVTT

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.200
Sakura, do not fear...

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.100
I'm here. You step back.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.530
Assault Blade.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.630
If you're going to defy me, then I guess I have no choice.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.230
Will you join that kid

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.200
as additions to my collection, Grandma Chiyo...?

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.700
Wh-What's that...?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.600
That's not Sasori's real body...

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.400
I can kind of tell that's not his real body.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.870
Yes... That's...a puppet.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.530
But where's his real body?

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.900
Puppet Masters are supposed to be pulling the strings from behind, right?

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.500
His real body's inside that.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.700
Inside?

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.130
Puppet Masters have trouble with close-range combat.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.000
After all, when controlling a puppet, they are prone to openings ...

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.830
That puppet there has basically surmounted that problem.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.600
The puppet acts as a shield as well as a weapon.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.300
It's Sasori's specialty, Hiruko.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.500
Lady Chiyo... About that puppet...

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.130
I know a lot about it.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.770
Do you know how I make my collection?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.830
First. I pull out the organs...

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.430
Then after I've washed the body nice and clean...

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.430
I extract the blood.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.670
Once I've prepared the body so it won't decay,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.670
I fill it with hidden weapons and then...

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.030
it becomes a complete addition to my puppet collection.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.700
Just as the old woman said, this form you see...

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.270
Hiruko, is a part of my collection.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.870
And with the little girl and Granny Chiyo added...

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.200
I'll have exactly three hundred in my collection.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.300
It's my art!

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.200
Hiruko vs. Two Kunoichi! 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.500
Gaara...!

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.070
Is it okay for you to be taking me on?

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.230
Kakashi Sensei of the Sharingan.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.230
I hate to say this, but...

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.470
my man Sasori is stronger than I am...

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.330
Probably...

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.100
Our ideas of art are quite different, though.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.730
Art, huh?

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.600
Lady Chiyo?

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.300
Back when he was in the Hidden Sand,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.870
he was called a master craftsman...

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.600
and he built many excellent puppets.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.530
But he devoted most of his energy

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.070
into turning people into puppets and collecting them.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.370
He calls that "art."

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.670
And that puppet Hiruko...

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.100
used to be a Shinobi from another village.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.370
He was turned into that form you see there by Sasori...

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.700
He turned into a "human puppet"

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.930
while still maintaining his original human form.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.470
A human puppet.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.570
That's what'll happen to you very soon.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.200
You'll become one of my works of art.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.670
Hiruko is a puppet with a great attack and defense.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.500
Be that as it may, first we need to extract Sasori out of Hiruko.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.170
Then, how do we do that?

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.430
The most frightening thing about a puppet is their hidden weapon.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.600
If we can't figure out what they are,

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.770
we won't be able to tell where and how he'll attack.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.370
But Lady Chiyo,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.930
you know a lot about the mechanisms of that puppet...

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.230
We've got the edge.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.930
Yes...

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.400
That's why I thought I could take him on by myself at first.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.000
At first?

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.530
But...it doesn't look like it'll work.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:08.900
What do you mean?

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:15.870
It has a different form than the Hiruko puppet I used to know.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.600
First of all, he didn't have a shell like that on his back.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.530
He probably has a better ability to guard now.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.000
And it's the first time I've seen that left arm.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.730
In which case, his most important hidden weapon mechanism

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.100
might also have been improved.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.070
What do we do?

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.730
In order to defeat Sasori,

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.770
first we must destroy that Hiruko.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.930
However, I don't have that kind of destructive power.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.700
But Sakura...

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.530
You do.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.200
That incredible strength Princess Tsunade...

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.370
personally taught you.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.530
Okay!

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.530
Listen carefully, Sakura.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.930
First, get close to him...

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.270
and smash the puppet with your incredible strength.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:43.700
However, you must dodge all of his hidden device attacks.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.900
All of them, perfectly!

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.500
You must not even get a scratch.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.370
Poison, right...?

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.470
That's right... Even a scratch can turn into a fatal wound.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:05.900
Here I go.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.500
Hold him down!

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.670
Right!

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.430
In order to dodge his attacks, you must figure out the tricks

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.970
to the hidden weapons of the master craftsman's puppet.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.670
And you must also be able to immediately assess

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.970
how to dodge his attacks.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.100
I don't think I can do either at all...

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.600
Indeed...

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.700
In order to do that,

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.170
a lot of actual battle experience is required.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.900
Then...how can I...?

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.070
What do I look like to you?

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.570
Do I just look like an unreliable old bag...?

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.100
Or...

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.330
Leave it to me...

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.900
That's why I'm here!

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.770
I have much more actual battle experience than he does.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.170
And he knows that.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.170
That's why he doesn't attempt to attack carelessly.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.470
This man who so hates waiting for people,

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.870
and being kept waiting by them...

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.730
And besides...

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.170
I made the first move.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.530
Sakura. Lend me your ears.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.670
You and I...

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.630
will defeat him!

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.530
What're they planning?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.970
From here, I can't make out what they're saying...

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.330
Understood.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:37.870
I'll give it a try.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.400
Are you about ready?

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.330
You know I hate to be kept waiting, don't you?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.730
Rest easy. We'll...

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.000
...put an end to this soon.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.270
It looks like they've started.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.130
Is just that little girl... and that old bag...

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.130
really up to the task of taking on my man Sasori?

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.630
So he wants to fight Naruto one-on-one if he can, huh?

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.300
He's a Shinobi who defeated...

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.770
the Kazekage, one of the five great Kage.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.300
Naruto probably wouldn't be a match for him alone.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.230
You go to Sakura, Sensei.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.470
I'll save...Gaara!

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.100
It wouldn't be worthwhile if you were beaten that easily.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.870
I won't let you... have Gaara, no matter what!

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.030
They're seeing through it...huh?

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.530
If so...

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.600
Die!

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.300
They completely dodged my attack just now?

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.500
I understand Grandma Chiyo being able to.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.230
But that little girl...

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.300
How?!

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.300
Grandma Chiyo's...

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:32.930
not moving...?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.200
I'm being mocked...

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.970
I can't believe she's charging at me head on without any backup...

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.070
It won't move!

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.470
I get it! Grandma...!

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.530
Now, Sakura!

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.700
Smash him!

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:03.600
Right!

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.030
I'm taking back Gaara!

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.200
You're sure a weird Jinchuriki.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:27.400
I'd heard that Jinchuriki were gloomy misanthropes.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.970
Not counting this guy,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.330
my comrades have defeated two Jinchuriki.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.970
It seems not even one comrade or villager

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.900
attempted to save them.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.370
In fact, it seems there were actually some people who were glad...

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:06.070
So you couldn't forsake someone pitiful and hated like you?

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.170
Gaara...

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.770
Gaara died after the One-Tail was extracted.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:46.170
That will soon happen to you...too!

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.230
I won't...forgive you jerks!

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.130
So you've finally come out, huh?

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.800
That's his real body!

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.430
I've come this far to see my grandson's face.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.700
After twenty years, what say we face each other?

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.200
Now we're down to the final question.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.000
"Whatever Kind of Job in the World Quiz,"

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.600
the last guest is this person!

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.000
Hey, this guy's covered in a cape from head to toe!

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.170
I got it! A famous actor, right?

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.370
Then, a muscular carpenter!

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.270
A job that has uniforms?

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.130
- Give us a hint! - No hint whatsoever!

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.170
I don't get it!

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.370
Time is running out!

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.100
H-Hold on!

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.130
Too bad guys! Now, let's have the guest to take off the cape.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.830
Next time: Sasori's Real Face
