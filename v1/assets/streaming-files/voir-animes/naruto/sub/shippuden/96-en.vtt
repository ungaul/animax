WEBVTT

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.470
Against this foe, there shall be no playing by ear!

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.300
I'm coming at you with full force!

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.300
I'm using the Honored Sage Mode!

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.670
What?! You don't mean...?!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.200
Yes indeed.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.870
I'm summoning the two great sages!

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.030
However, it's going to take some time to summon the two of them.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.170
And I cannot release my hands during that time.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.070
I'm counting on you. Buy me some time until then!

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.670
All right. Clumsy as I am, I shall try.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.230
He vanished. What a bother...

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.370
Where in the world did he find such a creature?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.670
Now that he's made himself invisible, we've got to use Barrier Battle Arts.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.500
Hmm... He's a hard one to battle.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.330
As I recall...

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.570
This is a barrier ninjutsu that senses and alerts any intrusion across its boundary.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.770
In that case...

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.770
He saw the barrier and switched to a strong offensive critter!

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.070
Mister Gamaken!

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.570
Right! Clumsy as I am, here we go!

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.300
You're quite skilled!

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.770
Not at all... I am clumsy.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.530
What?!

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.870
Wh-What is this?!

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.470
Are you okay, Mister Gamaken?

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.730
You think you could do this a bit smoother?

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.900
But I am clumsy...

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.330
They seem to multiply each time you clobber them...

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.030
I don't even have a clue what it is...

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.230
Are the doggies bound to a self-replicating summoning jutsu?!

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.600
In any case, we'd better move from this spot.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.700
We'll kill one dog at a time! Let's lure them into a small space.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.600
Right!

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.100
So that's the center of the jutsu...

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.800
Were we able to lose it...?

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.130
That should buy us some time.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.170
Or not!

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.330
We're surrounded already!

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.500
Incoming! And they're going to split up again!

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.570
Above you!

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.030
There's no end to this.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.570
I am  trying my best...

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.870
If they keep dividing, no matter how hard we strike them,

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.700
it's a waste of our energy.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.900
Here already? Damn persistent dogs!

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.370
Stupid little...!

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.200
Are you all right?!

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.230
Mister Gamaken!

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.670
I really am...

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.000
clumsy...

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.700
If you can't move, Mister Gamaken...

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.930
then there's no time to summon the two great sages.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.170
I give up.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.400
But I'm amazed there're so many of them...

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.430
But against the Great Toad of Mount Myoboku,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.370
you're all nothing but a small snack!

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.930
Honored Sage Mode!

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.070
Gone... Along with the dogs.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.430
So he's escaped for now.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.070
I haven't escaped!

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.100
Nagato, you're still a novice.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.270
Leaving your back open for an attack!

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.500
You're a Shadow Clone too?!

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.500
Yes, but that's not all.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.900
At the same time... Summoning Jutsu!

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.570
Damn it!

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.800
It's no good...

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.000
Mister Gamaken!

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.200
What?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.170
Whoa...

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.730
Yes!

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.970
You're relieved from duty!

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.400
I did it!

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.570
Huh?

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.070
It's one thing after another...

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.500
But I'm almost there.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.370
So I can't quit now, but...

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.330
Incoming!

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.330
Wha--?! So fast!!

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.000
Sorry I'm late.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.170
Good work!

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.870
I want to attack the caster, but I need to be able to see him!

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.530
Don't you think something is strange, Mister Gamaken?

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.530
I-I am...

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.100
too clumsy to understand what you mean.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.370
He who possessed the same pupils as the Sage of the Six Paths,

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.770
not only mastered every jutsu I taught him...

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.830
he demonstrated the ability to achieve all six changes in Chakra Nature.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.030
For a single person to do so is unheard of.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.330
He was well versed in all the mainstream ninjutsu...

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.130
and mastered them by the time he was ten years old.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.430
But why...?

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.930
Why is he only using the Summoning Jutsu against me?!

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.230
Does he think I am beneath the need for direct confrontation?

00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:00.630
Mister Gamaken! You've done enough! I've got it from here, go home!

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.230
All right. Thanks.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:05.570
Lad! Why do you always summon us in such touchy situations like this?!

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.500
It's no wonder Bunta gets so mad!

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:15.830
Aw c'mon, Ma. Naturally, Jiraiya-boy has his reasons.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.570
You be quiet, Pa!

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.500
It's been a while,

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.770
and I do apologize for calling you under these circumstances, Boss, Ma'am.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.300
But lad... I thought you said you hated that form,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.200
saying it would make you unpopular with the ladies!

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.830
I can't afford to be particular right now.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.030
After all, my foe has the Rinnegan.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.630
Ah...the Pupils of Six Paths?!

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.300
Someone actually possesses such an eye?

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.070
Well then, you had no choice.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:02.000
You gotta start being able to go into Sage Mode by yourself, Jiraiya-boy.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.700
Compared to you, I'm still just a novice.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.700
So please lend me your aid for just a little while...

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.400
Shall we begin?

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.170
He went through all that just to summon those two toads...?

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.630
No, there is a transformation going on in Sensei himself.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:35.300
Humph, whether it's Orochimaru or Jiraiya, the Sannin each have unique powers.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.930
And? Where is the one with the Pupils of Six Paths?

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.070
Your eyes must be degrading with age.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.800
No. He's hidden himself inside a summoning creature

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.630
that can make itself invisible.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.200
It's gotta be one of them chameleon species.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.500
I have erected a probe barrier.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.570
That won't do any good!

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.170
Let's drag them out using creature detection jutsu!

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:08.500
Ma, don't get so excited, you'll get more wrinkles.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.570
Just hush up, Pa!

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:18.670
But why go so far as to summon us to fight this fellow, Jiraiya-boy?

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.170
He happens to be a former student of mine...

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:30.570
We never knew you had one! Then is he...?

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.070
Yes...

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.730
As summoned.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.830
Ah, good. I'm glad you've come!

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.470
Jiraiya-boy.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.400
The Great Lord Elder had a dream about you.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.030
As you are aware, it is a prophecy.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.770
So listen carefully.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.070
Yes, sir!

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.600
I shall now tell you. In my dream...

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.530
You, who are solely pervy, will still manage to become a splendid ninja.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.370
And in time, you will have your own disciple...

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.030
That disciple will become a ninja

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.530
who will bring about a great change to the ninja world.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.000
That is what I saw in my dream.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.370
A great change?

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.730
Either great stability or great destruction.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.030
The likes of which this world has never seen before.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.900
One of those two.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.930
The child of the prophecy?!

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.200
Then why are you fighting him?

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.000
It seems he did not grow up in the right direction.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.800
And when I heard he had died...

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.830
I thought he couldn't have been the one.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.230
In any case, if he is not righteous, you must kill him.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:58.330
Well, that senile old man probably made up that prophecy.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.400
Don't worry about it!

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.400
All right let's do it!

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.500
Found him!

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.230
It's fast!

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.400
Gotcha!

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:28.500
There we go!

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.570
Pa!
I'm on it!

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.600
That's the Rinnegan?

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.230
It certainly looks like the one mentioned in the legend.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.570
What nasty eyes... I can't believe he's that child of prophecy.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.500
You will guide that revolutionary.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.770
The day will come when you will be forced to make a critical selection.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.800
Selection?

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:23.700
Your choice shall decide which way the change goes.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.770
Great Lord Elder...

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.200
 I wonder if this is that moment of selection?

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.330
Summoning Jutsu.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.470
This time he's summoned humans.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.000
You turned out to be a harbinger of destruction...

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.470
So as your mentor, it is my duty to take you down!

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.300
Those three...

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.030
They may look different, but they all have the same eyes.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.230
Even if Nagato is one of the three,

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.570
I can't believe there'd be that many Rinnegan running about.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.430
So what in the world's going on?!

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.230
There must be some explanation for this.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.900
Who and what is Pain?!

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.600
Next time: "In Attendance, the Six Paths of Pain"

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:04.970
Pay close attention to my battle!

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.400
Tune in again!
