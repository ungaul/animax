WEBVTT

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.320
Hey!

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.530
Neji, are you all right?!

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.650
Yeah…

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.190
I'm okay.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.610
Don't overdo it.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.230
Your eyes aren't the only things that can track the enemy.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.570
I have my nose.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.530
Leave this to me and

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.070
get yourself checked out by the Medical Corps.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.190
There's a medic tent in the rear center of every company.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.730
The coordinates are…

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.150
How much did you know about the Akatsuki?

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.230
I thought I knew more than you did, but…

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.570
Ultimately, we're both shinobi who were used.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.480
Thanks to our powerful Visual Prowess.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.440
This time too… The user of this jutsu is using us.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.570
Pain…

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.650
With your Six Path's Rinnegan and my Mangekyo Sharingan…

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.440
we could do anything.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.980
The jutsu user intends to take advantage

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.610
of my genjutsu power when the time is right.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.070
Itachi, you have always been wrapped in darkness,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.730
even when you were part of the Akatsuki.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.820
Medic Ninja in Danger

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.360
I need two Jonin Medics over here, please!

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.570
We have to resuscitate now!

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.480
Quickly!
– Right! – Right!

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.780
Are you sure you can carry this much?

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.610
Halt, please!

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.440
Under orders from HQ,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.440
we Sensory-type shinobi will have to verify your chakra!

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.400
We will not allow you to pass until this is done!

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.190
Sure, I understand.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.730
Hurry and get it over with.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.530
I'll bandage it…

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.570
Okay…

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.360
That should do it.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.360
Thank you…

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.320
Take care.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.530
Okay, next please.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.440
Neji!

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.940
I've taken care of all your external wounds.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.980
Thanks.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.360
Please get some rest, while you can.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.400
Especially your eyes!

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.480
You shouldn't overuse them.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.940
That's easier said than done.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.480
My job is to discern things faster than anyone,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.610
and notify HQ, in order to improve our chances in battle.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.190
To do that, I have to put my eyes to work.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.650
I know that.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.070
But while you're here…

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.980
Thanks.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.980
All right, the next tents on our rounds are F5 through G3.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.400
Is something the matter?

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.570
If you're still in pain…

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.650
B-Bad news! Toyosa, Takemaru, and Hino are dead.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.480
Someone has assassinated them!

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.480
What?!

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.820
What's going on?

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.610
A spy has infiltrated us.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.860
They're targeting Jonin Medics.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.110
But how?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.320
In order to get here,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.570
everyone's chakra undergoes strict verification.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.610
It's impossible with a simple Transformation Jutsu.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.440
And you cannot get through here

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.530
unless you're a shinobi of the Allied Forces.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.400
Which means…

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.400
that an Allied shinobi is being manipulated by a jutsu.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.480
It's highly probable.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.610
It's a formidable jutsu.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.900
What happened here?

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.190
Neji…

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.280
I see…

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.480
If there are only Allied Force shinobi here,

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.900
they'll be hard to distinguish.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.440
We can't tell who the suspect is.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.230
We're all standing around right now,

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.190
and it could be any one of us.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.400
And this is sure to breed suspicion among us.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.480
That's what the enemy is hoping for.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.280
We Medical Ninja are critical for our battle strategy to succeed.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.110
There's no way you can confront

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.610
the undead from the Reanimation Jutsu without our back up.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.480
If we're paralyzed now…

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.530
It will ruin our chances in the battle, that starts at dawn.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.690
I'll find the killer with my own eyes!

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.360
In any case, no matter what happens,

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.150
we cannot ignore the wounded.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.150
We'll continue our treatment.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.980
But we must be extra careful.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.650
Especially the Jonin Medics.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.280
Now then…

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.360
I-It's time to go on rounds.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.820
Y-Yeah…

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.980
W-Where did I…first meet you?

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.730
Huh?!

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.980
No… Listen, it's not like I'm suspicious of you.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.730
Of course not.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.030
It's just…just… You are suspicious of me!

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.610
Oh, it's you.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.480
Don't scare us like that.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.030
Say, have you seen Sakura Haruno?

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.570
Is something wrong?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.400
I got suspicious about someone.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.860
I was tailing him, but lost him…

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.650
Thinking back, I get the feeling that he was hanging around Sakura.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.190
Sakura is in Tent 3.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.320
What does this suspicious guy look like?

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.860
Well…

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.280
I could've sworn…

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.730
Well, it's me.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.900
Oh! It's you.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.230
Is your wound still bothering you?

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.230
Oh, no… It's fine.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.440
A-Actually, ever since you treated me…

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.780
I haven't been able to stop thinking about you.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.110
What is this?

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.530
I-It's…what they call a "love letter."

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.570
When I go into battle again,

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.030
there's no guarantee that I'll come back alive.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.280
So…

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480
Thank you.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.820
But…I'm already in love with someone.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.980
Oh, I see…

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.650
I guess he's probably…a Leaf.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:26.070
Well, a rejected man has no right to pry into who you love.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.030
I understand. I'll go now.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.150
I'm sorry…

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.980
I hope it all works out.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.570
If you love him…

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.570
he must be a great man.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.030
What's going on?

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.480
Why is the jutsu user going through such pains

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.570
to prevent us from encountering the enemy?

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.940
He's not going to use your genjutsu, after all?

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.780
It's night. Stalemate.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.730
Before he uses us to break the silence,

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:42.980
Madara has something up his sleeve.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.360
This Reanimation is the jutsu of Madara's new ally.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.400
It did not figure into Madara's original plans.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.110
Is that it?

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.150
Probably.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.440
You all right?

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.820
Neji…

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.530
It's easy to get discouraged.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.780
We don't even know who we're fighting.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.190
I know, we must be careful.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.190
Yeah…

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.980
Are you sure you don't need to go to the Medical Corps?

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.530
Cut it out, Kiba! I said I'm fine!

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.530
You overused your Byakugan and can barely stand!

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.940
So don't bother showing off in front of your subordinates!

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.400
Shut up, Kiba!

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.150
What the hell? You're so weak,

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.030
you can't tell the difference between a dog and a man!

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.530
And your Visual Prowess is supposed to be your specialty!

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.150
Hinata, don't overdo it either.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.150
That's because I have spread my Parasitic Insects

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.570
throughout the area, to look out for the enemy.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.280
Shino, I appreciate your concern.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.610
But I want to give it my all!

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.320
This is a war to protect Naruto!

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.530
We cannot lose!

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.480
By the way, Sakura…

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.780
Where is Captain Shizune now?

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.400
Huh? Did you figure something out?

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.360
Yeah…a little.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.900
We need to be in contact to report anything,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.860
no matter how trivial it is…

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.400
Until we find the suspect.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.280
Well, I think she's in Tent B-2.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.400
Shizune is treating Tonton.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.610
Seems like a bad leg sprain.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.780
Well, that's better than injuring a hand.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.360
Will they be able to rejoin the battle?

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.570
I think so…

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.730
Tonton can still weave signs, since the hand is uninjured.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.400
I see… That's good.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.650
By the way…

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.320
Sakura, would you mind taking a look at my arm one more time?

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.860
It hurts a little.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:22.280
Sure…

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.440
You can sit over there.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.860
How did you know?!

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.980
Pigs don't have hands!

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.320
Cha!

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.440
Tonton can still weave signs, since the hand is uninjured.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.400
Tonton…is a pig?!

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.610
She tricked us! Smart alec!

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.860
So, you're the murderer!

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.570
Tell me… How were you able to recreate Neji's chakra?!

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.400
What kind of jutsu is it?!

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.440
Explain or you'll get another one!

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.150
My Transformation Jutsu is the best.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.110
I may not be the only who has infiltrated this place.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.610
If this is just like Captain Yamato's report…

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.480
Note… Regarding Parasitic Clones.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.230
Kisame Hoshigaki was originally thought to have been taken down

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.070
by the Raikage and Killer Bee…

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.650
But it appears he survived,

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.900
having switched places with a parasitic clone

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.610
or something that is a type of Transformation Jutsu.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.940
Because this transformation also replicates the target's chakra,

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.570
it is difficult to detect.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.570
At the Five Kage Summit,

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.610
Zetsu of the Akatsuki suddenly emerged from other people's bodies.

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.070
He had absorbed chakra…

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.480
And this guy's transformation… I get it!

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:16.400
You are able to manipulate the chakra that you absorb.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.400
You can transform your chakra into your victim!

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:19.570
Isn't that right?!

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.280
There's too many of them!

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.480
You're absorbing chakra!

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.110
She's a smart woman!

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.530
W-Well…I wonder about that…

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.730
You may be able to camouflage yourself,

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.230
but you're not very good at lying, are you?

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.440
What happened?!

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.110
Did you hear that loud sound just now?!

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:53.570
Who's that?!

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.280
I have to contact HQ immediately!

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.530
Please take care of this guy!

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.440
You've hauled too many heavy loads, Tonton.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.280
What happened?

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.070
Sakura has an emergency!

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.780
Lady Shizune, reporting!

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:17.400
Empty it all out!

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.400
We're on guard duty next.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.570
I must have a bigger bladder than you.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.110
Look at the big ripples I made!

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.980
The ripples are… Don't forget to piss either, Tetsu!

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.480
It's going to be a long night.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.980
Hey Tetsu!

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.360
Don't stand behind me.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.150
You're distracting me, and nothing's coming out.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.480
How about if I make you bleed instead?

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.320
H-Hey?!

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.070
It happened again!

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.440
There are reports from every sector

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.230
that our comrades are being ambushed one after another!

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.280
There's confusion everywhere!

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.400
We don't know who the enemy is!

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.530
What's going on?!

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.070
A night raid is supposed to have been ruled out!

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.820
On top of that, we added security and positioned Sensory-type ninja…

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.940
Why can't we detect the enemy?!

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:16.860
Is it some kind of poison?

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.780
What's the condition of the corpse?!

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.280
All of them have external wounds!

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.150
They're physical attacks!

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.320
No doubt they're controlling Allied shinobi with genjutsu.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.900
Could it be Itachi?

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.820
Uchiha Itachi is the only one I know

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.780
who would be undetectable by my Sensory Unit,

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.480
yet still be able to manipulate with genjutsu from afar.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.650
But this is impossible for even Itachi…

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.690
controlling minds simultaneously,

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.530
over such a wide area, with such precision.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:50.320
Hold on!

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.030
We just got word from the Medical Corps!

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.440
The enemy looks to be…

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.480
White Zetsu transformed into an Allied Force shinobi.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.860
He's able to mirror chakra imprints!

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.730
That explains it…

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.230
So during the day battle,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.530
if one of our shinobi got his chakra absorbed…

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.860
White Zetsu can transform into him completely!

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.480
What should we do, Shikaku of the Leaf?

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.030
There is no way we can weed out who is friend and who is foe!

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.530
How will we prepare for the battle at dawn?

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.400
If we don't find the enemy immediately,

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.030
we'll not only lose precious time,

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.730
but our own men will become casualties!

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.400
In the end, they could end up killing each other!

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.610
So this is the power of White Zetsu…

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.480
The battle during the day was simply to set up the night…

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.940
This was the enemy's true motive.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.900
Calm down… I am rational.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.440
If I calmly analyze the situation, I will find a way!

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.650
Sort and evaluate…

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.400
Review every piece of intel relating to this war

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.400
and develop a counter strategy!

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.280
But stay cool, and do it quick.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.980
Cool, but quick!

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.480
Don't let them touch you.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.280
That's because they'll absorb our chakra!

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.900
Easier said than done…

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.400
How are we going to take them down without touching them?

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.440
I sent out a messenger owl.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.030
The sealing corps should arrive shortly to seal up this mine.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.610
So we just have to wait until then?

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.480
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "White Zetsu's Trap"

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.400
WHITE ZETSU'S TRAP Just how many of them are there?

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.650
WHITE ZETSU'S TRAP

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.110
Tune in again!
