00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Sasuke!

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.500
Eye of the Hawk

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.000
What is this?

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.130
Ah! How lucky of you to find this.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.000
It's the skin of a white snake.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.800
I've never...seen anything like it before.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.130
Actually, neither have I.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.130
It's a rare item that you almost never see.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.170
Why is it white?

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.300
Well, I don't really know.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.870
No one really cares about such things.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.800
But from times past,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.700
the white snake has been a symbol of good luck and renewal.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.630
Good luck and renewal...

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.770
It must be some sort of karma for you to find it here.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.300
Perhaps your parents are now reborn somewhere.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.230
Maybe someday... you'll meet them when you're grown up.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.800
When would that be...?

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.400
Who knows? I couldn't say.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.700
Nawaki...sure is eager.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.100
We're at war...after all.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.970
Tsunade's team has been...?

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.370
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.600
I said, stop!

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.770
That's enough! He's dead!

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.230
Humans...are such fragile beings.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.600
Power that was not used in a lifetime rests inside the human body.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.900
If we could release that power... Orochimaru Sensei!

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.370
What is this?

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.000
An amulet...? This...?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.930
It's a very rare amulet for good luck and renewal.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.700
Renewal? With this...?

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.730
But...Orochimaru Sensei,

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.800
no matter how earnest you are about your research,

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.470
you can't bring back the dead, can you?

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.670
Yes... Bringing the dead back to life is difficult.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.430
But, I've grasped a clue about regeneration.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.800
By activating their bodies,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.470
humans can become immensely more powerful

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.170
and heighten their regenerative powers too.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.270
I will share that power with you some day, as well.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.870
Yes! Thank you very much, Orochimaru Sensei!

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.730
The Body Activating Jutsu called the Curse Mark...

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.530
How foolish! There's a limit to unreasonable training!

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.430
Beautiful...

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.870
So this is the power of the Sharingan.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.500
No matter how many Ninja try to enter this territory...

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.670
No matter how hard they train, they could never surpass the Uchiha.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.370
ENTRY RESTRICTED

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.730
TRANSFER

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.270
I understand...

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.530
I understand the awesomeness of this Jutsu...

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.470
TRANSFER But, it would take at least one month to master this Forbidden Jutsu...

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.330
How many years would it take to master all the Jutsu that are here...?

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.770
It's impossible to grasp all the Jutsu

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.000
within the limited time of a human lifespan...

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.900
There would be a limit even if I could extend my life

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.900
via a Reanimation Jutsu...

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.300
Once I die, everything would be lost...

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.430
In order to grasp every Jutsu, I would have to...

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.130
Orochimaru! So it was you, just as I suspected...

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.000
Tell me! What were you doing here?

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.270
You probably couldn't understand...

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.830
You who puts the village before your own reason.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.300
To me, the lifespan of the human body is too short.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.270
Even if I were to be called a Hokage,

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.070
once I die, everything would end there.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.470
The Jutsu you're experimenting with... It can't be...?!

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.100
That very one... the Immortality Jutsu!

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.330
Can't you reconsider Orochimaru?

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.400
Out of the question!

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.800
How stupid can you be?!

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:14.170
I'm so close... So close with my research.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.970
I will have everything.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.070
My vessel is neither this body, nor the Leaf!

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:31.200
To that end, I will use that organization and anything else!

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.100
A new member has arrived.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.030
Itachi Uchiha.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:13.070
You destroyed the Uchiha. What brings you to the Akatsuki?

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.900
One who possesses the precious Sharingan appears before me...

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.130
How lucky I am...

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.330
I will have your body!

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:46.600
Could it be...that I... am under a Paralysis Genjutsu...

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.170
What visual prowess...

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.330
Marvelous...

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.630
Orochimaru...

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:23.970
Any Jutsu you use will have no effect before these eyes.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.300
You've come.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.130
Now, let's go...

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:04.020
My future lies in this child!

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.150
It's over... That was too quick.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.920
Looks like it's beginning to take effect...

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.320
The body fluid of the giant white snake skin vaporizes upon contact with the air

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.390
and becomes an anesthetic.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.750
I am immortal.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.350
The likes of your Jutsu cannot kill me...!

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:56.890
Now then...

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.320
I shall have you now!

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.520
What is this?

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.390
This is...a different space inside my body.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.320
Here, the Transference Ritual will be held...

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.290
We'll begin now.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.720
What visual prowess... Marvelous...

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.190
This is almost like...that time...

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.890
Those eyes...

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.550
Those eyes will be mine at last...!

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.090
He won't last with only the medicine...

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.420
He'll have to do the Transference Ritual as soon as today...

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.950
But...

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.620
It's hard to believe that Sasuke would consent willingly...

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:52.250
Well, even Sasuke can't resist that ritual...

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.650
Why is Sasuke here?!

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.750
That is the cast-off skin of the giant snake...

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.090
Does that mean the ritual is already done?

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.290
What's going on?

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.350
Kabuto, is that you?

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.650
Which one...

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.920
are you now?

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.020
Which one do you think?

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.320
This is the Transference Ritual!

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.950
He's showing me the memories of the Transference Ritual!

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.820
The ritual between the two will be settled right now!

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.150
What the--?!

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.750
This...can't be...

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:42.190
This is a place I created. This is impossible...!

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.820
Impossible!

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.750
It can't be...

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.750
This is my only...!

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.450
Orochimaru...

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.450
Any Jutsu you use will have no effect before these eyes.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.950
You...should realize that by now.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.420
How...hideous... Sasuke's will is eroding the space!

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.320
I'm not...going to let this happen!

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.520
I am the immortal Orochimaru!

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.250
Not here!

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.550
I won't let this happen here!

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.750
I am the one to unravel the order of this world...!

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.520
Everything...will be mine!

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.190
The clouds are moving ominously...

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.690
Almost like... A flaming sunset, like blood...

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.750
What's the matter?

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.950
No, it's nothing.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.750
Lord Orochimaru is dead.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.350
No... It's almost as if...

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.950
I took over all that he was.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.670
Three years have passed since he broke away all ties,

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.430
suppressed his personal feelings and trained himself,

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:47.100
just so he can achieve his goal...

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:53.070
Now is the time for him to take action with Orochimaru's power.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:57.600
What awaits him, as he pushes his way through the dark corridor?

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.800
Light or darkness?

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:05.770
Next time: "Zabuza's Blade"

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.070
Tune in again
