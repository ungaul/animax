WEBVTT

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.100
Well then, shall we get right to it?

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.930
Here it comes!

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.330
Die!

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.300
He's fast!

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.900
To think that Hiruko's tail fell to pieces...

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.230
You've got some pretty good moves, Granny Chiyo.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900
In that case, how about this?

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.900
Oh no!

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.000
Take this!

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.600
With the old lady manipulating things, it's impossible to get anywhere.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.070
In that case...

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.100
Oh, no! Sakura! Hold your breath!

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.170
Is it poison?!

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630
Sakura--!

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.600
I guess it's about time to start...

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.070
Hold it, damn you!

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.530
How lucky of me... to take on two Jinchuriki...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.870
Damn!

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.730
Naruto!

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.500
I'm not about to let him get away!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500
Kakashi Sensei!

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.570
Against a Copy Ninja,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.700
I guess one Detonating Clay is a little pathetic...

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.200
Having said that, there's only a little Detonating Clay left.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.570
I was intending to only lure out the Jinchuriki, but...

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.700
This is troublesome...

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.630
You jerk...wait!

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400
Wait, Naruto!

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.070
We've moved too far away from Sakura and the others.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.270
If we move even further away, the radio transmission will...

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.730
I won't be able to contact Guy's group...

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.670
We better hurry...

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.400
Chiyo's Secret Skills 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.000
You ain't seen nothing yet!

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:58.870
Damn...

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.200
There'll be no end to it this way...

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.430
Rotation!

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.730
Damn... What should I do?

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.400
Fighting against yourself... What the heck should I do?

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.000
Leaf...Hurricane.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.400
I'm really starting to get tired...

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.500
This poison will kill that girl for sure...

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.600
I'm okay! I managed not to inhale it...

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.970
Sakura!

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.670
You think I'll let you do that!

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.470
Th-This is...!

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.770
It's a Kunai Knife with a rope attached.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.130
You should have repelled it, rather than dodge it, eh?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.130
I can't hold my breath...

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.970
Sakura!

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.470
So you're determined not to let Sakura go, are you?

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.730
It's useless, Granny Chiyo.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.930
The poison will kill you by inhaling it even with the slightest dose.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.330
Sakura...

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.700
Looks like it's over...

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.430
Naruto...

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.830
I'm sorry, Naruto...

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.070
It'll mean I'll keep you waiting a little,

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.000
but I promise

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.530
I won't be a burden next time...

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.630
I promised Naruto...

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.130
that this time I wouldn't be a burden...

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.570
I promised him that...this time...

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.030
I would protect the two of them...

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.630
I...can't...in a place like this!

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.170
The poisonous smoke will stop in a minute...

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.200
Hang in there, Sakura!

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.100
I didn't plant only one source of poisonous smoke...

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.630
What?!

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.600
Sakura! Hold on!

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.930
I...can't die...

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.730
in a place like this!

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.200
What!

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.700
Sakura!

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.530
Sakura, hang in there... Sakura!

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.170
Not bad...

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.930
This is bad! She's not breathing!

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.930
Are you all right, Sakura?

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:50.270
Y-Yes...

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.500
She...

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.970
Did she use the blast waves of a Paper Bomb

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.870
to blow off the poisonous smoke?

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.570
Along with herself in it, escaping the trap in the process...

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.930
How reckless of her...!

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.070
You...!

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.000
I will capture you!

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.730
Even if my arms and legs were to be blown off...

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.130
Even if I were to swallow poison and become immobile...

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.670
I will capture you, no matter what!

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.600
No matter how much you might resist...

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.070
No matter what tricks you come up with...

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.730
I will make you tell me everything about Orochimaru!

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.130
You hear me?!

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.730
Even though I said I'd take the Jinchuriki,

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.500
the Copy Ninja is a nuisance.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.100
I have to somehow separate him from the Jinchuriki.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.200
Kakashi Sensei!

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.530
Awesome!

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.270
That guy is trying by any means possible

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.500
to separate me from Naruto...

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:17.170
I see... So he's trying to go against Naruto one-on-one.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.570
Damn! So my strategy failed, huh.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.630
I guess my only choice is to target the two of them together.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.070
I only have a little Detonating Clay left...

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.200
If I knew it was gonna come to this,

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.600
I should have prepared some more Detonating Clay

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.570
back at the base...

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.930
Well, I do have a trump card...

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.430
Huh?!

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:02.900
When a woman is talking, a man should listen quietly.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.170
Oh...those things...

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.630
So you remember these, huh...

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.770
Yeah, I guess...

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.370
That's right...

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.370
They're the first puppets you ever made.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.500
The father and...

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:47.930
the mother.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.130
Father and mother?

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.730
You mean, Sasori's...

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.630
So what do you plan to do with those now, huh?

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.700
Those are puppets I made. I already know its tricks.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.270
This is stupid...

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.400
I wonder about that...

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.700
A wire?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.300
Sakura! Stand back!

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.270
Okay!

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.170
Amazing...

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.330
This is getting messy.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.370
I better hurry up and use this thing...

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.030
As I thought, that puppet...

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.900
uses the Third Kazekage's Jutsu!

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.430
You haven't seen this in a while, have you...?

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:48.370
This Jutsu is why the Third Kazekage was praised as the most powerful.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.630
I'm gonna turn you guys into mush.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.830
What the heck is that?

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.130
That was the most feared weapon of the Village Hidden in the Sand.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.770
The Iron Sand.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.730
Once upon a time,

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.670
there was a village in where a boy lived.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.500
He was as cute as a button and had flaming red hair...

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.730
Who took millet dumplings along as he set out to kill the ogres, right!

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:50.670
What are you talking about?

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.500
The story goes: "He headed out shouldering a broad axe."

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.030
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.500
Wrong, wrong. He lived happily with his parents.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.770
And, rescued a turtle or something?

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.900
Not even close.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.170
Huh, I quit, I quit.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.800
I don't even know what story I was talking about anymore.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.030
- Huh? What happens next? - Huh? What happens next?

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.730
Next time: "Father and Mother"
