WEBVTT

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.930
Won't you reconsider this one more time?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.230
Reconsider what?

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.970
The issue regarding Naruto!

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.070
It's too risky to allow Naruto to take part in this mission.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.600
If something were to happen...

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.000
Don't make me say it again!

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.230
Team Kakashi, with Naruto and Sakura, will handle this mission.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.930
I've explained my reasoning!

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.530
I understand that...

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.200
But...it's not really "Team Kakashi" because he can't even go with them!

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.330
The situation is different from when we dispatched them to the Hidden Sand!

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.630
That's true...

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.870
You'll probably get mad if I say this.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.030
But I'll  take care of that Jinchuriki.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.870
In the previous mission, the enemy was clearly after Naruto...

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830
Wait! Hey!

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.370
We were able to prevent that because we had Kakashi Sensei with us,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.530
who knows Naruto very well... Naruto!

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.830
But we won't have Kakashi Sensei on this mission...

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.600
It's understandable that Shizune would be concerned...

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600
Don't worry, Sakura.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.800
That point has been taken under consideration...

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.830
I'll find two members to fill in the holes left by Kakashi and Sasuke.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.830
Make sure to tell Naruto as well!

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.400
Yes, ma'am...

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.530
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.730
Naruto! Just keep charging at him!

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.070
Ninja Art: Shadow Sewing!

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.900
Who the heck...are you...?

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.930
Lady Tsunade...

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.100
I'm on my way...

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.570
Tsunade...

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.170
I need to speak with you... Let me see you for a moment.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.370
Formation! New Team Kakashi 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.200
What did you want to talk about?

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.800
Since you two advisors are here, this probably isn't going to be pleasant!

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.070
As it happens...

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.870
Shizune recently came to us seeking our advice...

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.900
What do you want to talk about?

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.930
It's about Naruto Uzumaki.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.670
From now on, do not assign missions

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.530
with a possibility of contact with the Akatsuki to Naruto Uzumaki...

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.400
You know...the reason, don't you?

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.400
Yeah... I've been hearing about it from Shizune.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.370
From here on,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.130
make sure he works in a four-man squad with more skilled Shinobi

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.970
and increase surveillance on him as well as protection.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.030
Furthermore, you should decrease the amount of missions

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.170
you assign him as much as possible,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.770
and limit the scope of his activities.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.830
Got it, Tsunade...?

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.700
If Shizune has asked for your advice...

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.570
then you should know what my answer will be.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.370
Lady Tsunade...

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.800
No way!

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.100
Tsunade... Naruto's not just an ordinary kid.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.070
He's a Jinchuriki!

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.930
Under normal circumstances, the logical thing to do

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.770
would be to keep him in the village and under surveillance...

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.230
It may not sound like it, but this is a compromise.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.670
I agree that he should work in a four-man squad.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.230
But Naruto shouldn't have so many restrictions placed on him!

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.730
Even if we keep Naruto in the village,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.700
the Akatsuki will definitely come after him, come after the Jinchuriki...

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.400
Even in the recent incident in the Hidden Sand Village,

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.730
they went after Gaara, the Jinchuriki, even though he was

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.900
in what was considered the safest location in the village.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.600
There's a strong possibility that they'll take a similarly hard-line approach

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.400
in regards to Naruto as well.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.170
If that happens,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.730
at the end of the day, the Leaf Village will be in danger as well.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.400
If Naruto stays on the move,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.200
the enemy won't immediately be able to figure out what he's doing.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.130
First of all, Naruto does have talent...

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.630
He's a Shinobi who should be a great asset to the Leaf Village.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:04.000
That's a pathetic objection, Tsunade. You call yourself the Hokage?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.030
I'm trying to compromise too, you know!

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.300
Then can you ensure that, until then,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.000
Naruto won't get taken out by the Akatsuki?!

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.330
And can you ensure that if the Akatsuki take the Nine-Tails from Naruto,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.470
it won't bring about bigger calamity for the Leaf Village?!

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:33.790
As promised in that bet, that unlucky necklace...will be mine.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.200
That's enough! Don't protect me anymore, Naruto!

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.470
I told you...That kind of stubbornness will get you killed!

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.230
If you die, you'll have nothing... No dreams or anything!

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.900
That's enough! Move! Run!

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.570
It'll be okay...

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.070
Until...

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.930
Until I become the Hokage, there's no way will I die!

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.600
Here's a spell that makes dreams come true.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.100
Naruto...won't be beaten!

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.570
I believe that...

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.570
If...that judgment turns out to be mistaken...

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.300
what will you do?

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.430
If perchance, the Hidden Leaf Village and the Land of Fire

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.630
become endangered by my decision...

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.930
then as the Fifth Hokage, I will protect them with my life!

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.900
Very well... If you're willing to go that far, do as you like.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.330
However...

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.430
In exchange for that, you will use the Shinobi we select

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.400
as the additional members of the four-man squad.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.170
Fine.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.630
Danzo... Come on in!

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.300
You're...

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.200
Long time no see... Princess Tsunade.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.530
To think you'd  show up...

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:27.730
I see... So the new team members will be from The Foundation, huh...?

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.000
You're sure weak.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.000
Are you sure you have any "balls" with that kind of skill?

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.370
Wha--?! You little!

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.700
I asked...

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.430
who the heck you are!

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.070
We'll be seeing each other again...Naruto.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.000
Hold it!

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.470
Who was that...?

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.100
Choji! I thought you'd be here!

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.000
For crying out loud!

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.370
Asuma Sensei's angry and wants you to get a move on!

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:55.600
Sorry, Ino... We got attacked by some weirdo...

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.800
Some weirdo...?

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.000
By weirdo, do you mean... Isn't that Naruto?!

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.600
No... when I said weirdo, I didn't mean Naruto...

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.600
Naruto! Long time no see!

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.770
- Don't bother, Choji. - How have you been!

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.700
This atmosphere's such a pain... - Hey, you've gotta tell me your stories!

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:43.090
So you will be arranging the two additional team members?

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.120
No...

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.050
Just one member...

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.720
So you also weren't expecting the team leader, Kakashi...

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.420
to be out of action, huh...?

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.150
Since Kakashi Hatake is recuperating right now,

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.090
an additional member will be required on Team Kakashi's next mission.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.390
And we don't have much time until the mission.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.450
This should be left up to you, Lady Tsunade...

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:18.550
Kakashi's withdrawal is unexpected for me as well...

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.350
I was just at the point of wondering what should be done...

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.190
Then you should select someone very skilled

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.820
from the Anbu Black Ops under your direct control to lead the team.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.290
Yes! That would be good.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.650
You've no objections, right, Tsunade?

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.690
Leave the selection to me. Is that okay with you...?

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.150
How about it, Danzo...?

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.550
Then, I'll do it as I please...

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.490
L-Lady Tsunade...!

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.050
Geez, I don't like this!

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.290
I-I'm very sorry...

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.890
But I had absolutely no intention of betraying you...

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.450
I'm not talking about you!

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:28.490
What...?

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.490
I'm talking about that man.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.990
I'd also thought of having someone

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.820
from the Anbu Black Ops under my direct control replace Kakashi.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.550
I have someone specific in mind...

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.320
But...I never thought they'd suggest that from their end.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.750
I totally thought they were going to force

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.720
one of their own subordinates on me...

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.590
Does this mean one person is enough for the surveillance of Naruto?

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.550
Or...are they after something else?

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.390
Uh...Umm...Lady Tsunade...?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.850
Of course, I've got tons of things I want to say to you !

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.520
Yikes!

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.020
That said, the formation of Team Kakashi is a more immediate concern.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.220
You're going to work really hard!

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.350
Oh, y-yes, ma'am!

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.420
That was fast...

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.720
I heard it was a matter of urgency...

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.390
You know why you're here, right?

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.520
I have a general idea.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.310
I want you to take Kakashi's place.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.950
It's an honor to be able to work in Kakashi Senpai's stead...

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.080
This isn't an Anbu Black Ops mission. It will be a regular mission.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.310
Therefore, take off that mask and I will give you a codename.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.020
During this mission, you'll be known as "Yamato."

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:27.720
I understand...

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:33.290
An additional member... a new recruit from the Anbu Black Ops Training Division

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.890
will be dispatched to Team Kakashi.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.920
From the...Foundation?

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.950
However...

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.350
What is it?

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.320
Keep a close watch on his actions.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.120
What...do you mean?

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.750
Danzo recommended this new recruit.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.520
The man called Danzo...

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:00.950
used to be in the Taka faction that opposed the Third Hokage...

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.490
He formed the Anbu Black Ops Training Division

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.150
as a detached unit within the Anbu Black Ops and

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.120
took the position of chief.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.120
I'm sure you've at least heard of his name, right?

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:22.190
The Foundation has since been disbanded and he has fallen from power.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.520
But I still can't figure out what he's thinking...

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:29.920
Perhaps you're worrying too much...?

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.220
Never mind...

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.150
Meet up with the team immediately.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.720
Yes, ma'am!

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.850
Hey, Sakura!

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.420
This is the spot... where we're supposed to meet, right?

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.690
Yeah... No doubt about it.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.050
Nobody's here yet, considering...

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:12.050
Did Granny Tsunade really arrange new members for us?

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.620
It'll be okay. We just got here a little too early, that's all.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.650
We've still got a little bit before the meeting time.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.090
I hope they don't turn out to have the habit

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.050
of showing up late like Kakashi Sensei...

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.020
Hi...

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.720
Hey! It's you!

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.390
You're the guy who was up on the roof earlier...

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.020
Umm...as of now I will be...

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.750
taking Kakashi's place in Team Kakashi and...

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.120
This is going to be a nasty mission.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.990
Our mission is to capture the Akatsuki spy

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.050
who has infiltrated Orochimaru's organization

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.490
at Tenchi Bridge and bring him back.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.220
This is an opportunity for us

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.090
to obtain information on both Orochimaru and Sasuke Uchiha.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.550
If things go well, we will obtain a precious source of information

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.490
with which we can draw up plans

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.020
for both the assassination of Orochimaru and the retrieval of Sasuke.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.090
Keep your wits about you and

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.890
be sure to proceed through this operation with caution.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.290
Next episode: "An Unnecessary Addition"

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.190
