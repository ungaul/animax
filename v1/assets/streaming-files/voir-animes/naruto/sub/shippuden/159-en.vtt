00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.300
Hey, Nine Tails' brat, thanks for trying to save Motoi.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.430
Sure.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.130
Naruto has the ability to bring people together.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.630
Just like Bee.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.500
Yes! I totally agree!

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.600
I think I need to reconsider ya mate.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.430
You're quite a good guy, real top rate.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.000
Octopops, ya got the best rap…

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.730
I'm so happy to know ya, I'm one lucky chap!

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.770
It's great that Naruto and Bee share similar traits.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.130
But frankly, I wish he'd stop copying his rapping.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.470
Yo! Keep the beat.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.800
What do you know about Bee?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.200
If you keep complaining about him, I won't forgive you, kid!

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.370
Motoi trusts Octopops.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.170
Did that happen?

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.900
And Octopops trusts Motoi.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.270
Yo! I'm Naruto, ya know!

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.930
All right, it's decided!

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.970
Man, it's "ya know, ya know" all the time.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.270
Shuddup, ya know!

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.000
Go to the Waterfall of Truth.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.900
You'll pass with flying colors now.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.470
The Next Challenge! Naruto vs. Nine Tails!

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.700
So have you come back because you haven't learned your lesson yet?

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.370
It's going to be the same, no matter how many times you try.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.200
You cannot beat me.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.500
I know.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.330
Trying to defeat you with force isn't going to work.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.570
Because we use the exact same moves.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.430
You won't be able to chase me out either.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.400
I know you better than anyone else.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.170
Then…

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.830
You already know…

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.100
What do you want to say?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.430
What I decided earlier.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.830
I don't remember.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.230
Don't act like you don't know.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.070
Well, never mind.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.870
This place is supposed to show the truth in your heart,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.300
so I'll concentrate on the image and show it directly to you.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:17.370
HOKAGE CANDIDATE #1 NARUTO This is my autograph.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.370
Why you!

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.400
Oh hey! Give me your autograph, Naruto!

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.900
Could you make it out to my kid? He's a big fan of yours.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.130
An autograph?

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.900
The hero of the Hidden Leaf.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.600
The youth who created a miracle, Naruto Uzumaki.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.830
Give me your autograph too!

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.530
What is it? You refuse?

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.570
Oh no, but I'm not used to that sort of thing.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.600
I don't have a clue what to sign.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.400
Back at Ichiraku, I couldn't give them their autographs.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.330
Here it is now.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.300
Who cares if you have it now?

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.630
What a joke!

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.970
Everyone in the village is just sweet-talking you.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.600
They don't mean it.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.300
They've been lying to us the whole time.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.030
Making up rules and treating us like outcasts!

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.330
Don't you remember?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.370
It was so hard and painful.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.430
I'm the only one who will ever understand you!

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.600
Don't trust anyone from the village!

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.770
Yeah…

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.770
The villagers are important,

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.530
but there's someone else I have to trust first.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.770
I have to believe in myself.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.770
I need to trust the me that the villagers believe in.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.670
Why?

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.100
After all that they put us through?

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.170
Octopops made me realize something.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.900
He doesn't doubt himself at all. He has pride in himself.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.270
Do you…

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.870
Do you consider me a burden?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.230
Just what am I to you?

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.500
Because you existed, I became strong.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.870
Thanks to you, I've made it this far.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.530
And?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.500
And what am I…

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.900
And what am I supposed to do now?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.270
That's simple.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.730
You just become me.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.800
Since you are me.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.000
Thanks for everything until today.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.770
But it's going to be all right now.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.870
It seems… …it all went well?

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.130
It's too soon to celebrate, fool, ya fool.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.870
Shall we try to control the Nine Tails' power now?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.430
From this moment, I'll be your instructor

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.430
Ya better prepare yourself or else you'll suffer death n' torture.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.800
All right!

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.200
Come with me, Naruto!

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.500
Um, may I come along?

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.130
Okay!

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:46.930
What about Motoi?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.870
I have to report in to the Hidden Cloud at regular intervals,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.100
so I'll take my leave here.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800
Thank you for your help.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.100
Things won't be easy from here on out.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.630
So there was something on the other side of the waterfall.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.200
Wow!

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.770
You'll fight the Nine Tails here!

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.230
Fight the Nine Tails?

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.800
That's right, fool, ya fool.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.370
This is amazing.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.700
Follow me.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.530
These ruins seem to be quite old.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.700
They must have archeological importance,

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.200
they should be restored.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:27.700
No! Those stone statues were carved without heads to begin with.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.870
There's a reason for it.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.800
How am I supposed to fight the Nine Tails here?

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.400
What's more, how am I supposed to face him?

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.230
I hope you're not going to do anything excessive!

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.030
Do you think it's something that can be controlled

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.230
without doing something excessive?

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.900
Fool, ya fool.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.730
Since long ago, this has been a sacred place

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.500
where those selected as Jinchuriki have come

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.630
to undergo the Purification Ceremony.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.730
It's set up here so you can talk to your Tailed Beast in a special way.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.800
It's right inside this building. You hear what I say?

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.270
This is…

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.500
Only the chosen ones can enter… To be selected.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.500
Go and stick your head into the statue's mouth…

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.570
Like a good man, respected.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.670
If there isn't any darkness in your heart, the door will open…

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.900
Fully extended.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.970
Hey, can you explain it normally?

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.570
I don't quite understand.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.130
No darkness in the heart?

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.800
I see, so that's why at the waterfall…

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200
However…

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.170
If there's even a little darkness in your heart,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.500
the gate will not part.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.700
Do you consent?

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.430
And the statue will bite off your head and tear you apart.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.730
Are you content?

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.800
All the headless statues you saw on your way here…

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.830
are past Jinchuriki who weren't… sincere!

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.170
I'm your true self.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.730
The real you.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.700
This is too risky.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.100
Naruto, use a Shadow Clone.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.770
This is a sacred place, fool, ya fool.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.630
Generations of Hidden Cloud ancestors guard

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.100
and protect this place.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.370
Tricks like that won't work!

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.470
But… Captain Yamato…

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.500
I came here to learn how to control the Nine Tails' power!

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.670
This is important to me. I can't run away!

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.100
I'm going to believe in myself!

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.300
Naruto!

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.800
No! How could this happen!

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:11.870
Naruto!

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.600
You…

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.670
Just kidding!

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.770
There's just a switch in there.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.230
It's a habit. I couldn't help myself.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.700
I did the same thing too. Out of habit.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.430
Those stone statues are just broken. It's just some wit.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:33.270
I thought you said this place was sacred! Fools, ya fools!

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.000
This is…?

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.870
Go inside, close your eyes and focus.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.070
Just like at the waterfall. Then you'll meet your Tailed Beast.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.930
Before when I was training,

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.930
I was able to meet the Nine Tails in my mind.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.200
Any Jinchuriki can do that.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.400
But this is a little different, okay?

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.800
Listen to me very carefully.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:23.830
I'll give you an explanation.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.600
Naruto, what kind of Sealing Jutsu was used on your Nine Tails?

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.630
Please answer my question.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.770
It's a Tetragram Seal.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.070
A Tetragram Seal, huh. That's impressive.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.070
It's even more solid than my Steel Shell Seal.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.530
Do you have the key?

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.070
I have no choice but to do as you say, Great Lord Elder.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.700
What is this?

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.100
It is the key left by the Fourth Hokage

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.670
that locks and unlocks the sealing jutsu on your belly!

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.670
Yes!

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.970
You're going to undo the seal, after all.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.500
What if he can't control it properly?

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.930
What if the Nine Tails revives completely?

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.730
We'll seal him away here.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.200
That's what this place is for as well.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.700
Until we get a new Jinchuriki, this is where we'll seal him in.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.800
You got a problem with this? No booin'.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.900
– But… – That won't happen!

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.170
Because I'm going to do this.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.700
Okay! I'm going to shut the door.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.870
And I'll show you how to deal with the Nine Tails!

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.570
Naruto, you really do impress me.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.300
The rules are simple, as you'll soon see.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.400
Greet the Nine Tails in your subconscious mind,

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.830
then undo the seal.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.300
Hey, evil glare as usual.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.470
Naruto…

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.930
You…

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.970
What is it?

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.600
Where'd the real you go?

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.900
I don't sense him.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.530
I'm here…right in front of you!

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.230
You conquered hatred.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.230
But don't relax, do the best you can!

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.370
The Nine Tails is a mass of true hatred.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.430
That's absolutely true, man!

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.670
What're you up to?

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.130
Can't you see my mouth is full?

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.730
Here I go…

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.200
When the Nine Tails emerges from the seal,

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.700
grab the Nine Tails' chakra with your own chakra,

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.800
and pull it away!

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.500
Chakra can only be caught with chakra.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.800
It's common sense, son.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.130
Take the Nine Tails' chakra away from him…

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.430
and you'll be number one.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.270
Touch the Nine Tails directly and

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.030
stick your chakra onto its chakra, and it'll pull each other.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.200
In other words, it's going to be like a match of tug-of-war. Okay?!

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.630
I'll help you in your fight.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:23.000
But unfortunately inside your head I got no might.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.100
He's strong!

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.230
Just a word of warning.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.900
When you're trying to take his chakra,

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.130
there's the risk that he'll pull away yours.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.970
I don't need to explain what'll happen if all your chakra is

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.300
pulled away and you have zero left, right?

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.670
I see. You intend to control my power.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.500
So you teamed up with Eight Tails?

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.130
You, the Jinchuriki of the Nine Tails? That's pitiful!

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.430
The risks are high for sure.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.170
But if you take it away,

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.970
the Nine Tails' chakra will be yours forever!

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.930
Grab whatever chakra you can from the Nine Tails' will…

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.330
That will be your payoff!

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.630
Don't get caught in the Nine Tail's hatred.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.300
Use your strong will.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.930
That's how you'll ward him off!

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.500
Don't underestimate me !

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.500
Thank you, Octopops!

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.530
I managed to contain the explosion!

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.330
Naruto, that will be the last of my cooperation to your operation!

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.800
Thanks!

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.470
I'm sitting still just as I thought.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.630
Sage Art: Super Giant Rasengan!

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.370
Damn it. The Nine Tails is no joke.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.270
If it weren't for him… I hate him.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.300
What?

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.100
Don't give in Naruto! Fool, ya fool!

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:53.370
No one will ever respect someone like you!

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.400
What is this?

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.470
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Orange Spark"

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.930
Who are you?

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.270
Tune in again!
