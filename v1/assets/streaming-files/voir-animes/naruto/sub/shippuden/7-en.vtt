WEBVTT

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.430
Run, Kankuro 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.630
Damn you!

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.070
Cease fire immediately! We might hit Lord Kazekage.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.800
Y-Yes sir!

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.370
Cease fire!

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.300
Cease fire!

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.770
Cease fire!

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.400
Stop the attack!

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.030
G-Gaara...

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.200
What in the world is he after...?

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.300
Is he going to leave the village?!

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.270
My man Sasori must really be tired of waiting for me by now.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.630
Is he going to take him away alive?!

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.130
I won't let him get away!

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.400
Kankuro!

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.270
Don't be running off carelessly!

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.100
Wait until we can get a unit together!

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.570
We'll lose him if we just sit around!

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.100
I'll catch up soon!

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.770
Don't go after him too far on your own!

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.530
Yeah...! I know!

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.300
That jerk was after Gaara from the start?!

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.470
Lord Kankuro!

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.300
Don't let him get away, no matter what!

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.470
Yes, sir!

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.600
He landed...?!

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.230
There should be a unit securing that area there...

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.700
My mission is accomplished.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.200
You're late...

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.800
I told you not to keep me waiting!

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.070
Cut me some slack... This guy was pretty strong.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.500
That's why I told you to make sure you were prepared.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.300
How about the preparations here?

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.500
Things are all ready here.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.700
I had plenty of time, you see...

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.700
I was fully prepared unlike you.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.700
Then, let's get out of here.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.330
I'll never be back here again...

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.270
Hold it!

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.300
What is it...?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.230
It's too quiet...

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.570
There was a unit securing the village entrance.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.870
There should be quite a commotion if the enemy landed there...

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.700
And yet, I don't hear a single thing!

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.030
And...I've been sending several messages,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.900
yet there hasn't been a single response.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.100
What the hell's going on here?!

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.570
L-Lord Kankuro!

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.030
What is it?!

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.630
Wh-What's this...?!

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.330
What a mess...

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.300
They weren't attacked just now...

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.470
It might've been before Gaara started to fight...

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.700
There were even elite Anbu Black Ops members here...

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.170
They must have been attacked at once by a rather large group?

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.570
Or perhaps...

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.330
Perhaps...?

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.100
No. It's nothing...

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.270
I made a thorough investigation

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.370
when Gaara took the Kazekage position...

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.770
No way could there be a traitor among the Hidden Sand Shinobi!

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.630
From the looks of this,

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.500
the guys who took Gaara just passed straight through here.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.930
Hurry! We're going after them!

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:20.900
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.930
There's someone still alive!

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.330
Stop! Don't move him carelessly...

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.870
A paper bomb?!

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.670
It looks like they fell for your trap, Sasori my man.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:07.370
Of course. Traps are made to be fallen into.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.000
I get it.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.730
I'm home! I've come back, now!

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.000
Whoa! Just as I'd expect,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.300
things get pretty dusty when you leave it for years!

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.330
Sasuke... I'm back...

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.900
And I'm here to get you back...

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.130
It... It can't be...!

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.600
This means the group

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.400
that went to get Lord Kazekage back has been...

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.530
Don't tell me... they got Kankuro, too...

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
Get back! It's going to collapse!

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.400
What's that?!

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.770
K-Kankuro...

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.400
I was only able to save two of them...

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.570
These guys are hurt!

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.700
Get them some medical attention!

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.070
What're you going to do?!

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.200
Isn't it obvious?!

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.930
I'm going to get Gaara back!

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.030
Kankuro...!

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.230
He was strong enough to beat Gaara!

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.700
You don't stand a chance against him!

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.800
So are you saying we should just forsake Gaara?!

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.170
That's not what I'm saying!

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.830
If we can just find out where their hideout is,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.500
we can form a unit later and attack!

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.670
I guess I can't stop him, huh...?

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.930
Listen up! Just follow them...

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.770
Don't even think about making a move!

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.600
Yeah... If I can!

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.600
That Kankuro...!

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.830
They're mocking me...

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.500
Is it Gaara's sand...?!

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.700
Hang on... Gaara!

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.970
I leave this to you!

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.170
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.870
Deploy a pursuit unit and have them go after Kankuro immediately!

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:13.670
Yes, sir!

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.770
And contact the Hidden Leaf immediately regarding this situation!

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.000
Tell them it's an emergency! Got it?!

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.270
Yes, sir!

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.100
I have a bad feeling about this...

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.070
Something... Something's about to happen...!

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.830
I'm counting on you, Takamaru!

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.930
Go!

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.300
Lord Kazekage...

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.270
It'll be fine. I'm sure he'll come back right away...

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.530
This way, huh?!

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.170
Wonderful...

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.130
I couldn't help reading it over twice...

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.930
I guess I should get to bed...

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.200
Huh...? It's already morning...?

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.230
Uh-oh... Not good.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.900
I still haven't made the unit list for the new team.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.900
Not good, not good at all...

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.730
Where did I put... those documents again?

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:19.900
All right...!

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.630
What're you doing up so early...?

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.370
Everyone's still sleeping, you know.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:49.670
You...?!

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.500
I can't leave the village unattended for too long...

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.030
My business here is finished,

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.430
so I just thought I'd head back as soon as possible...

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.070
Without even eating breakfast?

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.500
I'll just find a teahouse or something along the way and eat there.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.230
What're you  doing here?

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:14.670
It's a pain, but I'm supposed to be your guide.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.230
I have no choice seeing as how it's a mission.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.500
Must be quite a hassle...

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.470
Here is fine...

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.300
The next time we meet,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.100
we will be at the Chunin Exams, huh?

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.770
Yeah... See you around...

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.130
It's about time you become a Jonin.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.830
It'll happen before you know it

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.770
if you stop saying stuff's a pain and just carry out your missions...

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.700
What a pain...

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.230
All right!

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.200
At last!

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.130
I don't like this wind...

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.000
What is it, Sasori my man?

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.170
I never thought... someone would be following us.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.900
Hold it!

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.370
I found you...!

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.630
You will return Gaara to me!

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.870
Deidara... You go on ahead...

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.930
As I recall...

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:42.530
he was the one who took Gaara using that strange bird...

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.270
Then this must be the guy who set the trap in the village...

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.230
I'll show you...my puppet show!

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:00.970
Crow!

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.130
Black Ant!

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:05.400
Salamander!

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.800
I'll say it again... You will give Gaara back to me!

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.600
You're late!

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.130
Finally, you're here...

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.000
Gee, sorry about that...

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.900
This time it took longer than I thought

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.570
to write up the documents for the new team.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:50.770
Today's our new team's first mission! Aren't you fired up?!

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.030
You've always been like that, Kakashi Sensei!

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.900
Oh, come on. You're already annoying!

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.100
It can't be helped.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.670
Kakashi Sensei's always had that look of disinterest!

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.430
I'm starting to lose my dignity here.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.670
If I'm not mistaken, that's one of the Hidden Sand's...

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.400
Puppet Master Jutsu, huh...?

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.070
Then I'm going on ahead!

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.930
You're not going anywhere!

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.570
Wha--?!

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.530
I don't like waiting for people,

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.900
and I don't like making people wait...

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.500
I'll finish this right away.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.730
With his brother's life at stake, it looks as though this is a match

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.970
that the Challenger Kankuro cannot afford to lose?!

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.700
Well, he is one of the finest Puppet Masters in the Hidden Sand.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.870
Meanwhile, the Champion Sasori has yet to show his skills,

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.100
making his presence even creepier!

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.170
Wow, Kankuro made the first move by bringing out his Crow!

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.330
And it just went down...

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.970
However, the challenger still has an ace known as the Salamander....

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.930
Wow, and just as we speak, there's the Salamander!

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.900
What sort of trick will it display for us?!

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.870
Next time: "Team Kakashi, Deployed"
