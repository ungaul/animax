WEBVTT

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.930
It makes it easier to cast my real Visual Genjutsu on him

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.680
by keeping him trapped in a small loop like this.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.600
So Kabuto's trapped in your loop now?

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.180
And that's the Izanami?

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.270
When did you cast it?

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.100
The first time Kabuto stabbed me with that blade.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.520
Back then, huh?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.310
But how?

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.020
You mentioned a Visual Jutsu that is possible without sight.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.850
How can Visual Jutsu work without eyesight?

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.180
Izanami is a Visual Jutsu that works with the physical senses

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.020
of both yourself and your opponents.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.100
The physical senses of two people?

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.350
As you are battling your opponent, you take a record, like a photograph,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.140
of the physical senses that both you and your opponent

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390
are feeling during that instant, with your Visual Jutsu.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.730
We'll call that A.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.980
As time progresses,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.180
you find "B" is a more important moment,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.560
then you record "C" and so on with Sharingan.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.270
Then you recreate those exact physical senses.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.060
So you're using your powers to create an exact copy of A.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.850
We'll call this A'.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.850
FLOW OF TIME By overlaying and connecting A to A',

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.230
FLOW OF TIME the Izanami also links a path for B' and C'

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.930
FLOW OF TIME to create fluctuations within a fixed time.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.430
In other words, it's the power to create an infinite loop.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.140
Naturally, all in exchange for one's own sight of course,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.230
exactly like Izanagi.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.310
So Kabuto's consciousness is trapped inside

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.430
fighting a phantom you and a phantom me for all eternity.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.270
No.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.640
There is an escape route built into the jutsu.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.520
The Izanami was developed to admonish

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.230
and save an Izanagi user.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.600
What does that mean?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.930
You know a little about the Izanagi already.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.980
It's called the perfect Uchiha Visual Jutsu

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.520
designed to change destiny.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.600
If something does not go the way you want it to,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.310
you can just erase that outcome and start all over.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.680
Ultimately, you can pick and choose

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.100
the most desirable end result.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.890
What I'm about to tell you now is the story

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.930
of the Uchiha's Izanami, and how it came to be.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.140
I want you to know this too.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.140
The Uchiha's Izanami… the story of its creation?

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.430
Izanagi and Izanami

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.560
Long ago, there was a great battle

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.180
that the Uchiha Clan could not afford to lose.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.100
The Izanagi tuned out to be invaluable.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.230
Go!

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.890
Damn it! They had set a trap!

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.100
What?!

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.390
Die!

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.520
As long as we have the Izanagi, we can't lose!

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.850
However… There's a bigger risk than just blindness

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.480
to a jutsu that allows the casters to choose their own ending.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.310
Most who used this overly powerful Visual Jutsu

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.140
could not handle it and abused their power.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.100
It was fine,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.560
as long as there was only one user of the Izanagi.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.930
However, when two or more used it,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.180
there was a scramble within the Uchiha Clan

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.850
to see who could get the best result.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.230
You are not the only one who can use Izanagi!

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.850
I don't like you bossing us around!

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.680
But I'm the one who accomplished it!

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.680
In the shinobi world, results count for everything!

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.480
Well then… I shall rewrite that result…

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.180
with my Izanagi!

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.730
You're only talk.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.930
I shall rule the Uchiha… no, the entire shinobi world…

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.930
with my Izanagi!

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.560
I'll take over your wish…

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.520
with my Izanagi!

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.930
What was created

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.270
in order to stop this inter-clan rivalry over the Izanagi…

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.180
is the Izanami.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.100
Normal vision-based genjutsu is powerless

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.310
against Visual Prowess…

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.270
If you intend to oppose me too, I have no choice.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.230
There has to be a way to settle this without fighting.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.060
My hands are already stained with blood.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.730
As if I'm going to stop!

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.230
You don't know yourself!

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.430
You don't know your own true strength!

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.350
Oh, shut up!

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.310
It's not too late to turn back right now!

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.770
If you have the will, take my hand!

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.600
I won't be fooled!

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.560
If you still refuse to listen, I'm prepared as well.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.980
Sneaking up behind me, nice work!

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.640
But as long as I have Izanagi, you cannot beat me!

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.520
It's over for you!

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.100
I don't believe this!

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.180
My right eye…

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.140
I should have gone blind with the Izanagi!

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.100
The Izanagi that you depend on so much will not protect you.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.230
Shut up!

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.180
N-Not… Not yet!

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.930
In the first place,

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.310
reality is a product of chance that we call fate.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.520
We can't predict it.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.730
But Izanagi can twist around an inconvenient reality

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.390
and lead it to a new fate.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.140
REALITY At a whim,

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.640
IZANAGI ACTIVATED the user can change the original reality into a new one.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.060
NEW REALITY IZANAGI ACTIVATED the user can change the original reality into a new one.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:16.730
NEW REALITY IZANAGI ACTIVATED To the enemy, a fallen opponent will revive,

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.140
ANOTHER REALITY IZANAGI ACTIVATED To the enemy, a fallen opponent will revive,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.600
so it's an intolerable jutsu.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.730
IZANAMI ACTIVATED The Izanami is set up to take someone who is using the Izanagi

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.680
IZANAMI ACTIVATED to change the outcome to benefit oneself,

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.730
IZANAMI ACTIVATED and cause them to endlessly circle around in a loop.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.560
I believed that Izanagi was the ultimate Visual Jutsu.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.310
But that means the Izanami is a far superior Visual Jutsu.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.140
Izanami forms a loop

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.270
around the physical sensation of Izanagi twisting reality.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.390
The Izanami is a jutsu meant for stopping the Izanagi.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:53.180
There's an escape route built into the loop.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.850
Originally, it was a jutsu to save Uchiha comrades

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.100
from arrogance and negligence.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.770
It's to stop you from taking the easy way out with jutsu.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:26.930
Why?!

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.600
There's no destiny that Izanagi cannot change!

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.310
Accept the things you've done,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.100
and take hold of the future that awaits you!

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.060
There's no way I can be forgiven for the blood on my hands.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.230
Still… Take hold of it!

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.230
I won't rely on Izanagi anymore.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.890
I'll accept reality and move forward…

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.600
IZANAMI ACTIVATED Once one accepts the original outcome and stops trying to run from it,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.810
REALITY the loop will stop.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.180
This jutsu guides you toward accepting your fate,

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.310
instead of relying on jutsu to change it.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.350
But a jutsu that has an escape is too dangerous to use in actual combat.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.310
That's why Izanami is a Forbidden Jutsu.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.480
If Kabuto stops trying to transform himself,

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.350
he can stop the loop.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.310
The strife-filled history of the Uchiha…

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:15.140
The arrogance and recklessness of those who used Izanagi…

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:21.140
and how they clashed and were stopped by Izanami…

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.140
I understand now

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.770
why both Izanagi and Izanami came to be Forbidden Jutsu.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.730
And I see how one must learn from the past

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.100
and accept one's fate and move on.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.350
But… But why bother casting this on Kabuto?

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.100
If there's a way to escape…

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.930
He reminds me of the old me.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.100
He thinks by acquiring all there is,

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.390
he can accomplish whatever he wants.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.310
He makes himself believe that he can't fail,

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.310
and lies to himself.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:04.850
I stopped listening to anyone else. I stopped trusting anyone.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.810
In Kabuto's case, he is so deluded

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.890
that he thinks all these powers are his and his alone.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.390
I empathize with him.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.060
We were both used by the shinobi world…

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.270
He can neither forgive himself nor accept himself for what he truly is.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.310
What he is doing is certainly wrong.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.850
But he's not completely to blame for not being able to realize that.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.100
My chance has passed,

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.430
but he can still forgive himself before he dies.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.930
Why would you ever feel like you need to help him do that?

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.980
He is not like you. You were perfect!

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.390
Sasuke…

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.930
I tried to control you with the Visual Jutsu

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.850
called Koto Amatsukami.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.930
I treated you like a child

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.390
because I thought you needed my protection.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.640
I didn't trust your strength.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.850
It may be that

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.930
a perfect being does not exist at all in the world.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.600
Sometimes two who seem to be opposites

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.180
are actually two sides of the same coin.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:23.100
They can only succeed when they actually work together.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.810
Like the Izanagi and Izanami.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.100
Look at me,

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.810
and find in yourself what I was unable to find in myself.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.100
Do not say I was perfect.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.310
First of all…

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.180
Impossible!

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.560
I will be a perfect being!

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.480
This is…not me!

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.350
How long will you imitate Orochimaru?

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.180
If you want to exit this loop, reexamine your mistakes!

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.430
Shut up!

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.480
I know he's going to come at me with a Fire Style Jutsu.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.600
Water Style… Water Dragon…

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.180
Water Style… Water Dragon Missile!

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.980
He anticipated that jutsu with Sharingan!

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.140
How did I get this wrong?

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.560
Where did I… make a mistake?

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.270
All I ever wanted was someone… to appreciate…

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.560
who I was!

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.180
All I wanted was to be acknowledged!

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.930
Where is the mistake in that?!

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.980
First of all… you had to accept yourself as you were.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.270
Then you wouldn't have had to lie to anyone.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.060
To you…or to me.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.230
If you lie to yourself, how can you have friends?

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.640
How can you trust or be trustworthy?

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.270
Lies will keep you from ever seeing your true self.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:35.730
If I wasn't trapped here… I'd have won this war by now.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.680
I'd be sleeping by now.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.600
Damn you, Itachi!

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.600
It's 9 o'clock already?

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.060
Something wrong?

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.430
No…

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.100
I just wish we could wrap this up quickly

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.310
so I could get a good night's sleep.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:14.100
They never tell us lackeys what's going on.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.680
That's true.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.270
So, what are you gonna do when this war is over?

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.600
Well, I'll start by going home.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.060
If the war ends and

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.770
the Five Great Nations continue to be allies…

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.020
then maybe my little brother who's been on a mission for a long time,

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.310
can finally come home.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.730
I envy those who have a home to return to…

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.100
You want to come with me?

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.230
Huh?

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.850
My home is an orphanage.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.180
And if my kid brother's back, he can take a look at your wounds.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.020
I appreciate that, Urushi!

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.270
I really hope you come back this time…

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.560
Kabuto.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.600
I'll stop the Reanimation Jutsu now.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.100
And…all the reanimated dead will fade away.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.980
That should end the war.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.520
But…

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.640
you'll be gone too, Brother.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.980
I'll have protected my village as

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.600
Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf once again.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.930
I have no more regrets.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.390
Why?!

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.850
Why help the very village that put you where you are now?

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.020
You may be able to forgive, but I cannot!

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.230
You have no more regrets?

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:57.310
What about what you've made me become?!

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.310
I leave Sasuke to you.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.100
I tried to do everything myself… and I failed.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.100
This time… I will leave it to my comrades.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.560
I'm not the one who can change you, Sasuke.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.520
But I can stop this jutsu.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.810
That will fulfill my promise to Naruto, at least.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.890
I will stop the Reanimation Jutsu!

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.230
Tell me the signs!

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:43.980
Tsukuyomi!

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.270
I kept my promise.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.350
I leave the rest to you…Naruto.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.770
I hate the Leaf Village for causing you so much pain!

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.770
I hate it more than ever!

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.850
It's because I'm your brother that,

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.230
no matter what you say, you're not going to stop me!

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.180
Even if you protect the village now,

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.520
I will still destroy it some day.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:01.390
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "I Will Love You Always"

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.430
Good bye…Big Brother.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:09.270
I WILL LOVE YOU ALWAYS Tune in again!
