WEBVTT

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.800
So you won't let me get away, huh?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.470
This shadow technique only lasts about five minutes, right?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.370
And it's just the two of us...

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.070
That works out well for me, too. You idiot!

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.070
I can stock five hearts including my own.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.100
Kakashi... I will take your heart to replace the one you took from me!

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.770
Everything's ready...

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.000
The two separate bodies merged.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.000
So the Fire Style... and Wind Style masks merged, huh?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.130
Kakashi... I will take your heart to replace the one you took from me!

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.100
That one, huh?!

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.830
He's trying to force me into an open area

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.930
where he can shoot me down, huh?

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.570
Is that your idea of hiding?

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.030
- Sensei! - Sensei!

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.800
Shikamaru's Genius

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.730
You did a good job of hiding this time, Kakashi.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.230
But do you have the courage to show yourself before us again?

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.400
Not again!

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.000
Water Style: Water Wall!

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.930
Fire with the wind Change in Chakra Nature added to it...

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.300
can't be put out just with Water Style, huh?

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.400
Looks like I'll have to confront him at close range, after all.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.070
Kakashi Sensei!

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.330
It appears you didn't get around

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.730
to watching out for my movements.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.070
Your heart...is mine.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.130
Die!

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.700
How about that...? It's addicting pain, isn't it?

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.930
I'm counting on you... Shikamaru...

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.270
How worthless...

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.700
Lord Jashin must be disappointed...

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.600
Now...

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.200
Kakazu must be about finished by now, too...

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.570
Wh-What did you do?

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.100
It seems... he made it just in time...

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.770
I-Impossible!

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.770
Time to go...

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.930
Not deep enough?!

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.130
You jerk...

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.430
Why are you alive?!

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.230
You jerk... Why are you alive?

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.070
I just pretended...

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.670
I was dead.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.270
The blood on that weapon...isn't mine.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.670
It's your partner's blood.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.100
I-Impossible...

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.600
Yes, it is possible.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.470
Your own blood was used for your partner's ritual.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.730
So, Kakashi Sensei, here...

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.500
Please use it when there is a chance.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.070
I'll let you keep it.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.770
Shikamaru knew his opponent's ability utilized blood, after all.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.200
He'd prepared capsules of blood in advance.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.870
What does that mean?

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.600
Anyone would've been fine...

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.030
If given an opportunity, we needed to get your partner's blood.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.830
In this capsule, you see...

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.370
It can't be... When did you have the chance?!

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.570
When I put a hole inside you with my Lightning Blade...

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:15.000
I took your blood at the same time.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.930
I'll capture him by myself.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.830
And...

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.100
And I'll fulfill that role...

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.500
So I took it...and my role was to trap you.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.470
Hey, where are we going?

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.230
Are you trying to separate me from Kakuzu?!

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.600
You...jerk!

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.570
Shouldn't someone go with him?

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.330
You're really underestimating Hidan.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.800
And here, that kid called Shikamaru or whatever...

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.200
would've become a bounty of high value someday.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.270
Today...he dies.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.800
Heh. That was...our strategy.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.700
You jerk...!

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.200
No way...

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.030
That kid... He planned that far ahead...

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:11.970
That's about the size of it.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.900
You should've handled him more carefully...

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.330
You guys really underestimated him.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.530
There's no way he would let the information

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.230
that cost Asuma his own life go to waste.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.970
You guys who take peoples' lives without hesitation

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.030
could probably never understand how he feels.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.470
Kakashi Sensei!

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:49.700
Are you okay?

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.300
Well...somehow I guess.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.670
I can't believe they invaded his body this much

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.830
in such a short period of time.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.070
If Shikamaru had taken any longer...

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.000
Slowly! Make sure not to damage the vessels.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.400
I'll treat you immediately with my Medical Ninjutsu.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.700
The treatment can wait!

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:15.900
What?!

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.300
Here they come!

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.670
Expansion Jutsu!

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.100
Super Slap!

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.800
Nice! Good one, Choji!

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.700
Choji!

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.770
What?!

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.600
Oh no!

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.470
What?!

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.030
He came back to life?

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.800
He absorbed the Lightning Style monster's heart.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.900
What's that...?

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.630
His main body's a monster, too.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:51.000
Two of my hearts...gone.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.030
It's been a long time... since that happened...

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.900
Even I can tell, and I'm not all that bright...

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.430
It's been so many times already.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:24.130
Any idiot could figure out your Jutsu after seeing it so many times.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.170
What did you say?

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.600
It seems your Jutsu isn't as strong as it was before.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.970
I didn't even need five minutes...

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.530
I can move!

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.730
The endurance of your Jutsu power and its effect

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:12.000
gradually decreases each time you use it.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:29.130
Basically, the longer you use it, the weaker it gets.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:37.700
Aren't you just about out of Chakra? Huh?!

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.470
You won't get away...this time.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.570
Here he comes!

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:01.530
- Right! - Right!

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.700
He's fast!

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:07.570
Damn it!

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:08.900
I can't move...!

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.430
Kakashi Hatake...

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:20.300
I was going to replace the hearts I lost with yours...

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.270
But I've changed my mind...

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:32.830
I can get more hearts anytime I want, after all...

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.570
Die!

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.270
Wind Style: Rasengan!

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.300
Water Style: Ripping Torrent!

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.600
Hurricane Vortex Jutsu!

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.800
Sorry...we're late.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.070
Perfect timing...

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.230
Do you know what those words mean?

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.270
It means if you curse someone and attempt to kill them,

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:47.930
you will also be killed in retribution, so two burial pits are necessary.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.130
You cursed and killed my teacher.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.930
Don't think you guys can just romp about carefree...

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.500
That's your burial pit.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.200
Next time: "When You Curse Someone, You Dig Your Own Grave"
