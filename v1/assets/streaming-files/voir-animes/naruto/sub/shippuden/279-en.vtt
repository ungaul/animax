WEBVTT

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.080
Naruto…

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.170
Sometimes your eyes are better than mine.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.920
Sasuke is in the darkness right now…

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.710
Go…

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.750
You're the only one who can save him.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.210
Yeah…

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.290
I know.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.070
The Final Battle

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.980
My explanation of what it means to be Hokage

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.940
represents my response.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.900
The way Itachi lived led me to this answer.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.400
To protect the Land of Fire and the Leaf Village,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.230
he sacrificed both his clan and himself.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.940
First, I needed to know why.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.070
What is this Land and Village that he would go so far to protect?

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.230
The previous Hokage said…

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.030
…that the village is a framework

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.070
created to stop the slaughter of clans and children…

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.030
…a framework that was supposed to lead to peace.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.650
Itachi tried to sustain that peace all by himself.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.280
That's when I finally understood…

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.400
Suffering bitter experiences, living in darkness

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.030
as a criminal and traitor against Land and Village…

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.900
He was a shinobi who took on all hatred

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.860
and protected the Land of Fire and the Leaf Village from the shadows.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.110
I feel he was the true Hokage.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.230
It's not the one who is acknowledged by all…

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.190
…but the one who accepts all the hatred

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.820
that is worthy of that title.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.530
I eventually came to understand Itachi's feelings

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.650
for his Land and Village.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.780
My big brother failed in just one aspect.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.610
He let me, his little brother, live.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.940
Unable to hide the truth from me,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.030
he allowed the hatred to disseminate.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.570
However… I'm not like my Big Brother anymore.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.400
I have no father, mother, brother…

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.480
not even a single member of my clan.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.230
I am all alone.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.730
I alone can bear the weight of all the hatred now.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.030
And I alone will deal with everything personally.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.860
I will handle all of the shinobi's problems.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.320
I will also dispense all judgment and punishment.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.570
I'll concentrate all hatred upon myself…

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.030
…and bring together every single village under my control.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.030
Hatred inside darkness cannot be eliminated.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.900
In which case, I'd rather…

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.610
That's right… What the Hokage is to me…

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.780
…is someone who will sear away the darkness of all Five Villages

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.030
with only his own flame.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.530
And then keeps living by eating the ashes.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.650
And you think everyone will just sit back and say "yes" to that?

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.820
I told you already…

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.230
I don't care what you or anyone else thinks.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.070
Besides, I have the power now to control it all.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.110
You don't have a clue about how Itachi lived!

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.900
There are things you can't do alone!

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.730
Just like our battle with Kaguya!

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.980
But things don't always go well…

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.980
Like with these two stone statues

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.940
And us two brothers…

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.070
With revolution…

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.940
…the villages will no longer have to bear darkness.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.900
And I alone will become the darkness.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.480
I'll dispose of the deep darkness of the past,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.940
and build a pure white future from scratch.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.110
You mean by killing the Tailed Beasts,

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.980
and the Five Kage?!

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.230
Exactly.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.730
I'm casting off the past.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.110
You're saying you can pretend nothing ever happened with Itachi?

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.940
You and Itachi were brothers, and a lot happened between you…

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.440
That's what made you who you are today!

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.690
Itachi is now in my past.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.690
I'm cutting all past mistakes and doubts here, and starting anew.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.690
Beginning by cutting you down.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.360
Yours will be the last blood I shed,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.440
in the memory of my late brother.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.150
I won't…let you kill me.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.480
I learned everything I know from the people of my past!

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.900
Especially about how to figure out what to do after making a mistake.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.900
You said you consider Sasuke a brother.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.980
That's why, Naruto,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.820
I believe you are the only one who can stop Sasuke.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.650
I'm leaving Sasuke to you.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.690
That's why…

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.030
I won't let you kill me.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.980
Lord Sage!

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.110
It seems it's almost time.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.570
What…

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.030
What should I be doing?

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.900
Just continue to have faith.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.030
Right now, that is all we can do.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.320
What you do and what transpires, will be up to the two of you.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.320
Sasuke and I aren't real brothers,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.320
but I think we can make peace with each other.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.690
Now that Itachi's gone,

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.110
I feel like I'm finally, truly alone.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.360
But with Naruto,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.650
he's the one person I have to cut down.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.730
My version of the Hokage can only come to be

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.480
by severing all bonds and being alone.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.860
Why?

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.900
Because… Because to me…

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.030
…we're really good friends.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.110
…he is still my closest friend.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.190
Naruto… Sasuke… Show me your answer…

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.980
Show me the answer for all shinobi!

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.650
Inferno Style: Honoikazuchi!

00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:59.030
His left eye is…

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.320
How the hell do you think you understand?

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.280
You've been alone from the start!

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.900
It's because I have these ties, that I feel this agony.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.530
How could you possibly understand

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.070
what it feels like to lose all that?!

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:28.900
What's the matter?

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.400
Are you just going to play defense?

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.280
If you keep stalling, you'll die.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.780
I don't wanna kill you!

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.980
To me, you've become my closest friend.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.360
You're trying to be alone again and I can't let that happen!

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.940
Especially since we both know what that's like…

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.900
That's why I can't let you…

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.030
…go there… …intentionally!

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.820
Quit yapping.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.650
We're both different from

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.030
the two boys who fought here long ago…

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.980
I know your heart…

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.980
…and you, mine…

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.940
But you still wanna fight me?

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.190
All the more, because it's you.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.230
I have to cut you out of my life.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.110
There's no guarantee that the world

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.570
you'll rebuild after severing the past…

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.190
…won't end up just like this one, you know.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.780
That's exactly why I'll continue to watch over that world…

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.030
So it doesn't.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.190
You're missing the point!

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.730
The Five Villages are finally united!

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.280
Yeah… But that's only because they found a common enemy.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:52.150
To defeat the Akatsuki, Madara, and Kaguya…

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.190
the Five Villages had no choice but to discard their grudges

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.940
and form an alliance in order to survive.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.690
But their mutual foes are now gone.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.070
Eventually, conflicts between each village will begin again.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.780
So this time, you're gonna become the enemy?

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.610
And? What'll happen after you're gone?

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.730
Finally,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.280
all the dots have connected and formed a straight line.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.940
I started with the Sharingan

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.320
and now, I possess the power of the Rinnegan.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.860
Reincarnation, immortality… I have many options.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.030
I'll also be able to control things from the shadows,

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.780
instead of through battle.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.030
You're planning to return to that hell,

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.690
for the rest of your life, or rather for all eternity?

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.070
While being hated by all?

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.820
To me, that's what a Hokage ought to be.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.150
That's not even close enough to kill me.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.980
I told you! I'm not trying to kill you!

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:08.730
I'm—!

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.860
Enough.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.730
I'm the strongest in this world right now.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.940
So right now, right here…

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.030
will be my first step into the shadows.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.190
I can feel it,

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.610
how did he gain so much Nature Energy so suddenly?

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.190
You finally decided to kill me, huh?

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.360
We've taken on a lot of responsibilities

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.610
upon our shoulders…

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.400
But you see, I wanna fight,

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.690
and win against you fair and square!

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:02.070
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: Naruto and Sasuke

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.480
…but not against the current you!

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:28.610
NARUTO AND SASUKE Tune in again!
