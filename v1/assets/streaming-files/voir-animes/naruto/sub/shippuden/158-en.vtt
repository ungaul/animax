WEBVTT

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.900
How am I supposed to beat that guy?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.330
Well that, I do not know.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.770
Octopops trained here too, right?

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.870
I can ask him…

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.200
No, he won't tell me.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.770
Not with that attitude.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.170
Probably not.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.600
I wonder if Octopops had a dark half too?

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.100
Hey, Mr. Motoi…

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.330
Can you tell me more about Octopops?

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.830
Like how he grew up, and his personality.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.370
Maybe I can get some hints from that.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.830
Maybe I can figure out the difference between us.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.570
If you're a Jinchuriki,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.100
you can imagine the kind of life he's had to lead, can't you?!

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.400
I sure can!

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.300
And that dude should be able to imagine what it's like for me!

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.430
I don't like talking about other people.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.570
But Naruto, you're a Jinchuriki just like Master Bee.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Being able to control the Nine Tails has a direct effect on world peace.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.070
I'll do it.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.800
Thank you!

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.730
I told you earlier…

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.900
Since you're also a Jinchuriki,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.630
you can imagine the kind of life he's had.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.070
And it's just as you would imagine…

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.000
Formidable power breeds fear and antagonism.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.000
Bee has always been shunned and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.800
considered a nuisance by the villagers.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.330
But he never got depressed or complained even once.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.130
He was always cheerful…

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.170
always trying to work the people around him.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.130
More than anything,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.700
instead of being ashamed that he was a Jinchuriki,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.530
he didn't hide that fact.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.500
To me, he seemed to take pride in himself.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.370
Yo.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.900
The reason why he was able to take pride in being a Jinchuriki…

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.500
was probably because of his older brother, the Raikage.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.430
From days past, in order to prevent betrayal,

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.930
Jinchuriki have commonly been selected from close blood relations

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.570
of the Five Kage like siblings, or even spouses.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.370
A Jinchuriki is a power used to protect the Kage,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.770
the head of the village.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.430
It is also a symbol of the Kage's strength.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.400
I think Master Bee tried to be a fine Jinchuriki

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.630
for Lord Raikage's sake.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.300
It's said that he mastered his training

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.170
at the Waterfall of Truth in no time.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.530
I deeply respect the kind of person Master Bee is.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.730
I consider him to be one of the heroes of the Hidden Cloud.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.970
Such a well-loved Jinchuriki.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.870
Master Bee must be quite a person. And you too.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.400
I know!

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.630
Can you ask the Octopops for training hints on my behalf, Motoi?

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.830
I can't do that.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.930
Why not?!

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.470
I have no right to request such a thing.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.730
I once tried to kill Master Bee!

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.170
Killer Bee and Motoi

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.830
Why?! You just said you respected Octopops.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.230
You seem to have a reason.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.700
So what is it?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.400
This is a confession.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.230
You're a Jinchuriki like Bee,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.800
so I think it's okay to tell you about that incident.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.800
Incident?

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.700
This took place 30 years ago…

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.900
Back then, the Jinchuriki's power was not strong enough

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.400
to completely control the Eight Tails.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.570
The Eight Tails often went on a rampage

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.500
and wreaked havoc on the Hidden Cloud.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.800
Every time that happened,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.930
the Third Raikage, the Kage at that time,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.830
and his elite staff would stop the Eight Tails.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.070
Listen! I want you to stop the Eight Tails' movements.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.370
While you're doing that,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.870
I will imprison him in a Sealing Urn.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.870
Understood.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.870
Okay, get to it.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.270
Damn it! The chain forged from the Sealing Jutsu…

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.430
Don't give up!

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.230
If we give up, Hidden Cloud Village will be destroyed.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.930
All right, this should…

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.900
Now! Pin him down!

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.700
Don't mess with me, lowly humans!

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.870
They were somehow able to suppress the Eight Tails' rampages

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.470
and shove him back into the Sealing Urn.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But there were fatalities each time.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.630
However, despite the risk,

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.400
it was crucial to control the Eight Tails

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.430
in order to preserve the power balance between nations.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.170
Experiments continued with the Jinchuriki.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.330
Among the many who died or were injured…

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.830
was my father.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.500
Master Bee killed your father.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.500
That's why… No, that wasn't it.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.770
Master Bee and I used to be friends.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.100
We were only five years old when my father died.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.900
Bee, you did it!

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.800
The Jinchuriki that killed my father died

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.400
when the Eight Tails was extracted and sealed.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.570
It was the previous Kage's Jinchuriki.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.900
Right after that,

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.470
Master Bee was chosen to be the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.530
So why did you try to kill Bee?

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.370
There is no way to control the Eight Tails.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.000
There would be many more victims.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:50.930
That's what I thought.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.870
My hatred towards the Eight Tails grew.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.700
I was just a kid,

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.770
but I kept thinking about getting revenge.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.300
Master Bee was always laughing.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.130
I started hating him more and more

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.970
because it seemed like he didn't care.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.330
My hatred of the Eight Tails

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.970
shifted to Master Bee, his Jinchuriki.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.130
I thought if I killed Master Bee, the Eight Tails would also die.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.970
I attacked Master Bee from behind.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.270
But I failed and ran away scared.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.970
My face was masked,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.770
but Master Bee might have guessed it was me.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.800
After that, I stopped talking to Master Bee.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.130
Even after all that,

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.830
how did you come to respect Master Bee?

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.300
My hatred didn't disappear overnight.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.630
For a long time,

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.930
I continued to stalk Master Bee and kept an eye on him.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.330
But I wasn't the only one.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.970
Master Bee was shunned by the villagers and despised.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.600
All the time.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.200
Get lost! You're disgusting!

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.500
Even though he was forced to become a Jinchuriki because of politics,

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.130
in order to protect the village,

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.600
people still ostracized him.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.170
Oh yeah?

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:24.700
Yo yo yo, check it out, yo! Hey, yo yo, hey c'mon, yo yo!!

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.030
Check it out, yo! Yo, hey, yo yo!

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.100
Anyone else would have gone insane.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.500
And for the first time…

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.130
I realized that Master Bee's suffering

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.530
was even greater than mine.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.500
Why did you tell us?

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.570
Truth be told, I'd rather have Master Bee hear this,

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:56.700
but I think I'm telling Naruto because he is a fellow Jinchuriki.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.970
I know that I owe it to Bee to tell him the truth some day.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.300
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a confession.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.800
How convenient for him.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.200
Naruto, where are you going?

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.430
I need to be alone for a while!

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.630
It's that boy… Remember, stay away from him!

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:47.930
Go away!

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.730
I believed in you! You're a hero, Naruto!

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.600
Thank you, Naruto!

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.430
To them,

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:05.770
I am now a relic of the past that is difficult to get rid of.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.200
Gaara is the Kazekage, you know.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.000
Don't be so disrespectful!

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.230
You're nothing but subordinates!

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.400
Gaara is reserved, cool, strong, handsome, an elite, and…

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.830
Octopops has earned so much trust.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.970
And Gaara has become the Kazekage,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.370
working for the sake of his village and gaining acceptance.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.230
And me, I have Iruka Sensei and my comrades and…

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.500
Why didn't you give them your autograph at Ichiraku?

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.370
They changed their attitude pretty quick

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.830
and tried to get friendly with you, huh?

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.900
They were disgusting, weren't they?

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:54.930
Who are you?

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:01.500
The villager treated us like outcasts, but now…

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:07.070
I am the real you that exists deep inside your heart.

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:08.800
I am the real you.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.970
The real me.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.430
I never even gave it a thought.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.630
But somewhere deep inside, I'm still…

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:20.770
It's true.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.730
I'm still not confident that I have everyone's trust in the village.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.800
Where did Naruto go?

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.470
Don't tell me…

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.170
The location of this island is top secret.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.800
There's no way an enemy would…

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.600
That was old man Motoi.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.230
Damn it!

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.370
Old man Motoi !

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.770
Naruto! We're going to go with Formation C!

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.530
Why… Why?

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.630
Naruto! What are you doing?!

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.570
Stop, Octopops!

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:17.400
Old man Motoi really trusts you!

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.330
It's a squid!

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.470
That's not an octopus! It's a squid!

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:25.970
A squid? What?

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.130
It's not an octopus?

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.300
1, 2, 3, 4, 5… You don't even have to count.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.030
An octopus is round! A squid is triangular!

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.270
What?

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.430
I thought Motoi told the truth to Octopops

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.900
and he got mad at him.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.730
We got worried and went to look for you,

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.470
but this thing started attacking us.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.870
Let's see, this is the squid that attacked us earlier!

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.330
Naruto! Save the talking for later!

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.570
Let's do this!

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.370
Gotcha!

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.330
Wood Style! Silent Strangle Jutsu!

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.230
Old man Motoi!

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.830
We're coming to get you!

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.530
I'll tell you how I feel… I'm gonna save you for real.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.470
That's my deal… That's my spiel.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.630
Eight Tails and me retake the stage!

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.300
Knocking the beat-up squid right off the page!

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.730
The rest, I won't engage.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.130
Octopops!

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.230
Bee, why did you save me?

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.100
Master Bee, you knew, didn't you?

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:51.700
That I tried to…

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.400
kill you.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:05.630
And yet…

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.470
Did that happen?

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.100
What I remember is…

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.400
Me and Motoi… Me and Motoi.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.830
The times I spent with Motoi, together…

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.670
We trained hard like birds of a feather,

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.630
We made mistakes but it was no disaster…

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.830
The two of us always exploding into laughter.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.600
The two of us laughing, best friends forever…

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.330
The times I spent with Motoi, together.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:48.970
Yay!

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.470
From this moment, I shall be your instructor

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.830
You better prepare yourself,

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.430
or else you may suffer death or torture.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.070
It's finally time to start training!

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.170
This is a sacred place where those selected as Jinchuriki

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.970
have long come to undergo purification ceremonies.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.430
You'll fight the Nine Tails here, fool, ya fool!

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:59.130
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Next Challenge! Naruto vs. The Nine Tails"

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.330
Hey Nine Tails… Evil glare as usual.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.200
Tune in again!
