WEBVTT

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.240
I'm counting on you. Take it to the Hokage.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.990
A Shinobi's Resolve

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.580
Enter!

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.340
A Shinobi bird sent by the Anbu Black Ops has just arrived.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.010
Where is Kakashi?

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.970
He is probably with Naruto.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.220
Regarding that matter, huh...?

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.560
Tell him to see me when he is done.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.350
Have they tracked down Orochimaru's hideout?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.980
No... It says they nearly had him when they were suddenly attacked.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.820
We must select members for a search team to be sent off immediately.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.950
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.080
There's likely no traces left of the Anbu Black Ops

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.750
who sent this message...

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.460
"The rule of the Anbu: When you die, leave no corpse behind."

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.630
He can't possibly rest in peace unless we discover that hideout.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.170
An order from Lord Orochimaru...

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.670
From Lord Orochimaru...?

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.480
That is the order of Lord Orochimaru.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.360
Is that so...?

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.120
From Lord Orochimaru himself! So he hasn't forgotten about me!

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.080
When I was sent to take care of this remote hideout,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.330
I was sure I had been forsaken.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.000
Did I say something funny, Guren?

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.630
Humph... All we have to do is get them to kill each other.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.760
The sound of bones being crushed! Piercing screams!

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.970
Just the thought of it gives me a thrill.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.060
It's to select members for Lord Orochimaru's next operation...

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.680
There's no point if they all die.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.980
Yes, I know that!

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.480
Men! You all heard that, didn't you?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.480
If you want to leave this hideout

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.070
and breathe in the open air, you must win!

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.950
Then, you will be able to work for Lord Orochimaru under my command!

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.120
You are such fortunate men!

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.080
Now, begin!

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.480
Fight all you want!

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.650
Here you go!

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.860
Miso-flavored pork bone stock with roast pork...

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.040
The two thick slices of roast pork are on me.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.160
Thank you!

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.540
Just what I've been waiting for.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.840
Oh... It's hot!

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.550
Be careful. Our ramen noodles stay hot till the end.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.260
It's just not easy eating with my left hand.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.600
But this kind of makes me happy.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.900
Huh?

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.610
I feel like you and I are getting closer to Sasuke.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.160
Here, lend me those chopsticks.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.460
D-Don't tell me, Sakura... You're going to feed me...?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.420
Oh!

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.510
Say ahh...!

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.340
This isn't the part for you to butt in!

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.180
What...?!

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.100
Yo... Not "What"!

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.850
Huh...?!

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.470
What's going on?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.890
Just when Sakura was about to feed me!

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.310
When a friend is in trouble, you must help him.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.820
That's what a true friend does according to this book...

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.150
Never mind reading books like that. Just read the situation, will you?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.450
How can I read something that I cannot see?

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.240
You're such a pain!

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.790
What's with all this noise?

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.660
Kakashi Sensei!

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.000
Naruto can't eat with his right hand...

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.750
and we're having a little disagreement over who's going to feed him.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.970
Here, eat!

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.180
So in the end, it's Kakashi Sensei?!

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.510
By the way, Kakashi Sensei, I'm surprised that

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.520
you haven't landed in the hospital after a huge mission like that.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.400
So is that how people perceive me nowadays...?

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.440
What a shock...

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:54.160
Well, this time, I didn't need to use my Mangekyo Sharingan, you see.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.040
If you all hadn't arrived in time, I would have used it again for sure.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.170
Sorry... we're late.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.890
Then, just as you imagined, I'd probably be lying in bed now.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.150
Naruto... You have definitely gotten stronger.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.610
You're equal to me, or even stronger...

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.170
But keep in mind that the greater the Jutsu you use,

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.750
the greater the risk to you.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.130
Yeah...

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:58.390
Kakashi... This new Jutsu... the Wind Style: Rasen-Shuriken.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.970
Forbid Naruto from using it again.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.730
If he continues using this new Jutsu,

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.650
Naruto will lose his ability to mold Chakra.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.110
If the cells are disconnected from the body's Chakra Network,

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.490
even my medical skills won't cure him.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.070
Be certain to emphasize that to Naruto.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.950
Naruto...

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.290
That new Jutsu of yours... Kakashi Sensei...

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.130
I know myself best!

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.920
I'm going to be the Hokage one day, you know.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.470
I'm really powerful, so there's nothing to worry about!

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.180
I shouldn't have bothered worrying about him.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.990
I guess these should be the members of the search team.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.740
Isn't Kakashi here yet?

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.490
He's been notified.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.030
He must be having a hard time with Naruto.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.620
I wonder if Kakashi will be able to talk him into it.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.670
We'd better put a guard on him for a while.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.880
He's sure to start training on that new Jutsu.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.670
But if he does that,

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.920
he'll never be able to build up his Chakra again...

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.430
Yes. If that happens, his career as a Shinobi will be over.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.850
Now, I can't ignore that.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.810
Yo! It's been a while...

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.270
Weren't you investigating the Akatsuki Organization?

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.400
I stopped by because I was a little worried.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.070
Tell me the details on what you said just now.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.070
Thanks for the ramen, Pops!

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.040
Give Kakashi Sensei the bill!

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.620
What?!

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.700
Thanks...!

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.120
Thank you.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.540
Wait, what...?

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.710
So, you've finally learned to do the Shadow Clone...

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.550
What...? What's going on?

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.810
Then...let me see how much you've improved.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.100
- Here I come, Big Brother Naruto. - Here I come, Big Brother Naruto.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.480
- Sexy Two-girl Jutsu! - Sexy Two-girl Jutsu!

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.780
Whoa...! So that's your new move?!

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.370
What do you think, big brother?!

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.080
The two girls are...

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.920
Are you all right, Konohamaru?!

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.350
Hey, Moegi, what are you doing?

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.310
What are you doing in front of us ladies...?!

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.890
This is like déjà vu...

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.480
You two!

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.440
This isn't what you always do when you get together, is it?

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.110
W-Well, this Jutsu makes a good diversionary tactic...

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.570
Besides, you could say this is a serious competition

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.660
between the two of us.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.620
You two shouldn't be escalating things like this.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.250
You two are the only ones who would fall for a Jutsu like this!

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.830
You guys...

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.580
You seem to be having fun, as usual.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.340
Oh! It's the Pervy Sage!

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.300
Here's another one that would fall for it...

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.510
Oh... You're looking better than I expected, Naruto!

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.600
Oh, well this is nothing.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.730
Idiot! The bones haven't healed yet!

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.940
You haven't changed at all.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.210
Enter.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.670
Lord Orochimaru, it's time for your medicine.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.220
Oh, you're back...?

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.600
Yes. I returned a little while ago.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.350
How's Guren?

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:11.890
The same...

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.180
I just don't understand why

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.400
you make such a fuss over that woman.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.520
You've never liked her, have you?

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.650
She may not look it, but at one time,

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.070
she was my top candidate.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.700
Of course, time was not on her side

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.330
and Genyumaru was selected in the end.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.040
I am aware of that.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.750
When Sasuke achieves the skills he needs...

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.250
The time for my reanimation will be near.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.210
When that happens,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.970
both the Akatsuki and Leaf Village will be a hindrance...

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.220
Our current operation is preparation for when that happens.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.930
Lord Orochimaru, it's because of the plans scheduled after your reanimation

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.190
that I believe there are too many flaws in that woman's character...

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.820
This job can be carried out by no one but Guren.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.740
Speed up that test...

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.780
Yes, sir... We may be able to leave today.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.200
I'm coming in.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:57.540
Tell me... Do you like red camellias? White camellias?

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.460
Camellias don't lose their petals; the whole flower falls off.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.210
You can get oil from the nuts,

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.800
and the tree makes very good charcoal.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.590
Don't come in here... Go back!

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.050
Go back?

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.390
I wonder where I can go back to?

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.310
Where should I go back to?

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.350
Is this where I'm supposed to return to?

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.560
But, something's not right.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.780
This is not the place where I'm supposed to return to.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.780
That's right... You wouldn't know that, would you?

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.830
Say, do you have somewhere to go back to?

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.620
Such a place does not exist for me.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:45.380
So here you are, Yuukimaru... It's time to leave.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.840
All right.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.170
Sorry to bother you.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.720
See you again, Sasuke...

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.850
So, was Naruto convinced?

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.520
He has matured.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.230
I left the rest up to that man...

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.950
That is for the best... There's something I want you to do.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.700
Ninja File

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.780
It's a search mission...

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.410
It hasn't been confirmed yet,

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.670
but the Anbu Black Ops have discovered what could be Orochimaru's hideout.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.040
However, the operative has been killed

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.760
and the map he sent me only shows the general area.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.840
I see.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.090
Do you have a problem with the members that I have chosen?

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.350
I'm impressed...

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.270
You have chosen the best possible members for this search team.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.900
Kakashi Sensei...

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.530
Is everyone here?

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.410
I'm sure you've already heard about our mission.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.450
Yes... It is to pinpoint the hideout

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.080
that's thought to belong to Orochimaru.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:09.210
Yes... With all of your abilities, it should not be very difficult to do.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.720
First, I'll get a head start and release my parasitic insects

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.970
to search out the area where Chakra is in the highest concentration.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.310
Akamaru and I will do the rest! His nose will pinpoint their hideout.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.690
Once we find the hideout,

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.900
I should search out the enemies' Chakra using my Byakugan, right?

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:36.610
I'm counting on you...

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.160
If that is really Orochimaru's hideout,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.580
the chances that Sasuke is there...?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.790
Yes...

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.290
Does Naruto know that?!

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.580
That's a silly question.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:55.760
If he knew that, he'd never sit still.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.720
That's true.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.970
Yes. Naruto hasn't been told about this mission...

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.820
Tsunade told me about it.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.990
You've perfected the Wind Style: Rasen-Shuriken...

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.900
Well done!

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.360
It's no good...

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.530
Huh? What do you mean?

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.540
You have accomplished a feat not

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.410
even the Fourth Hokage was able to.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.620
Have more confidence in yourself.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.000
If this is the result, then it's no good.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.800
I mastered an Instant Kill Jutsu.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.300
But...but...it's pointless if I'm only going to waste

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.470
my Chakra on top of getting injured!

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.760
I see...

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.560
This isn't a Jutsu that can be used over and over.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.770
I have to learn a couple Jutsu that use less Chakra,

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.400
but are effective.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.410
Is that what you were worrying about?

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.450
In that case, all you have to do is train some more.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.700
At your current level,

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.290
there are sure to be other Jutsu that you can master.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.920
What do you say?

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.710
Will you come with me on another journey to gather writing material?

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.420
I'm asking you if you have the will to train with me once more.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.800
Yeah! Take me with you!

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.100
All right. Then we'll leave at once!

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.640
Where are we going?

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.890
First, we must heal that arm!

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.230
Shall we visit a hot spring?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.570
What do you mean, "hot spring"?!

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.860
I can see exactly where your thoughts are headed, you Pervy Sage!

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.660
But I found a spa with mixed bathing

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.530
that's good for healing broken bones...

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.290
See, that is  your motive, after all!

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.080
Yes, well that's too bad. Maybe I'll invite Sakura, then.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.540
What?!

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:58.000
Yes, yes, I'll go. Wait for me!

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.550
Come on, take me with you.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.090
I'm injured, you know... Don't leave me behind, Pervy Sage!

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.350
To think he'd jump out all of a sudden...

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.310
Hinata, how is he?

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.230
He's already dead... But his body...?

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.490
There's no doubt. Orochimaru's Curse Mark.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.070
If this is really the hideout, what's going on in there?

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.910
There are multiple traces of fading Chakra within the cave.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.200
Looks like we'll have to go in, Kakashi Sensei.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.870
Be aware of your surroundings as we move along.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.420
Be wary of any traps.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.250
Next time: "Orochimaru's Hideout Discovered"

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.800
- The Fifth... - Hidden Leaf Super Quiz!

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.510
Your hosts are, yours truly, Yamato and...

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.640
Ino Yamanaka, filling in for the ill Sakura.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.810
Before I give you the question,

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.860
all of you know that every Ninjutsu has a name, right?

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.190
Take for example, Choji's Jutsu...

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.480
It's the Super Expansion Jutsu.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.280
Exactly.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.280
So here is a question about a Ninjutsu not named in the series.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.030
Now, for the question.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:33.870
What is the Jutsu that Tayuya

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:37.910
used to reel in three angry ogres with her flute?

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.960
Demon Flute: Phantom Warrior Controlling Music

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.090
That's correct!

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.750
Shino! How did you know that?!

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.710
You want to know?

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.130
That's because it is written here in the Book of Secret Accounts on Fighting!

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.050
For Shino, who got the answer correct,

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.180
we have a prize of a 100,000-ryo book certificate.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.930
I'm going to buy lots of JUMP COMICS!

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.230
Ino!

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.640
Yikes!

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.150
You lied about the Super Quiz being cancelled

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.980
and you stole my role as assistant! Cha!
