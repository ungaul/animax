WEBVTT

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.500
You're saying that the Fourth Great Ninja War is about to start?

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.670
Even if it is Madara Uchiha,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.670
can he really take on the Five Great Nations?

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.030
Wake up!

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.500
Madara Uchiha leads the Akatsuki.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.100
Just one of their members, Nagato,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.000
was able to destroy Hidden Leaf Village!

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.130
Have you already forgotten that?!

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.700
I agree with Lady Tsunade.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.400
The Akatsuki already have the Tailed Beasts

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.030
from the One Tail to the Seven Tails.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.130
If they intend to use them as military weapons,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.930
then we must consider their strength to be far greater than Nagato's.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500
And if that is the case, the Five Great Nations…

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.530
no, the entire world is in danger of ruin.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.100
We cannot delay action any longer.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.670
All right. But do you know where Uchiha Madara is?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.770
We have a general idea of the location.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.130
The Mitarashi Unit just reported in and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.330
they confirmed spotting someone who fits the description of Madara Uchiha.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.870
I see.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.500
They are presently working to get more solid intel.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.430
It doesn't rhyme.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.670
Isn't there a nice phrase?

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.100
Unless we are sure about the enemy's headquarters,

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.430
and where their hideout is,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.630
it will be difficult to launch an effective surprise attack.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.670
And so, we will first dispatch a reconnaissance team.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.230
All right.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.730
– To maximize their efforts, we will have – "All right," eh?

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.870
– three surprise attack formations. – Lacks originality.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.870
To ensure success,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.330
– each formation must be comprised of – What if I switch it around like…

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.730
– expert shinobi from the Five Great Nations. – Right-o?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.030
Right-o… And then I add a little rap flavor and…

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.800
Yo right-o.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.830
Yo right-o, yo right-o, yo right-o yo…

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.100
This gives us a pretty clear picture of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.430
the Hidden Cloud's military strength.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.900
Lucky for us, the Eight Tails is a fool.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.100
It's not working.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.600
This phrase is making me mad!

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.170
Can't figure it out.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.930
We don't have current intel about the enemy,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.500
so we must rely on intel from the others to assess the situation.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.070
So we're to go empty-handed and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.500
depend on intel from other villages?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.200
Will they even share their data?

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.900
If they refuse to divulge what they know,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.030
then the Allied Shinobi Force is meaningless.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.200
We'll just have to trust them.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.000
We don't have time to waste.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.900
At this every moment,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.670
Madara Uchiha is preparing for war.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.270
All right!

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.700
We will hold a meeting of the Allied Shinobi Force in three days!

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.230
Send word to each village!

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.200
Shortly, I will make an announcement

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.400
to everyone in the village about the impending Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.300
Fourth Great Ninja War…

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.170
You didn't know this yet, Sakura.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.230
But Madara Uchiha has declared war.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.470
It's not a war between nations this time.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.930
The Five Great Nations have joined forces for a war,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.570
the likes of which has never been seen.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.030
The enemy is…

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.000
None other than the Akatsuki.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.170
The Akatsuki… We're really going to fight Sasuke.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.570
When the fighting breaks out, many will be stricken with anxiety.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.230
It will be your job to monitor their mental state.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.970
Circulate among each team and report anything that you deem necessary.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.430
Do not hide anything.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.200
I understand.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.800
Also, make sure you keep an eye on Naruto.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.070
I cannot have him acting recklessly.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.830
In this war, the Akatsuki's goal is Naruto.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.400
What's going on, Shizune?

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.230
Well, just now…

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.170
Naruto suddenly disappeared from Ichiraku.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.030
What?!

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.030
You don't suppose the enemy…

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.930
It's impossible for Naruto to be kidnapped from this village!

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.800
Find Naruto immediately!

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.770
The Five Kage's Decision

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.200
See you, Giant Gramps Sage.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.400
All right, I'm sending you back.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.070
I'm back.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.670
Where'd you go?

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.830
I thought you suddenly disappeared, and now you're back!

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.030
I had something to do.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.430
Oh, Naruto!

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.700
They said you suddenly disappeared and everyone's in an uproar.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.200
Huh? No kidding!

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.930
I never thought I'd run into you here.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.900
Oh hey! Give me your autograph!

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.430
Could you make it out to my kid. He's a big fan of yours.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.600
Autograph?

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.970
The hero of the Hidden Leaf.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.470
The kid who created a miracle, Naruto Uzumaki.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.670
Give me your autograph too!

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.730
What is it? You refuse?

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.600
Oh no, but I'm not used to that sort of thing.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.770
I don't have a clue what to sign.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.130
Everyone’s making a fuss over him lately as the miracle kid.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.830
But until just recently, it was just the opposite.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.500
I can’t blame the boy.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.270
Gentlemen, will you let him eat a bowl of ramen before that?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.730
Oh, sure…

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.400
Yes!

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.000
I finally get to eat!

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.570
Naruto!

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.330
Oh Sakura!

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.870
Where have you been?!

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.700
Where? I was suddenly summoned and…

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.830
Just come with me right now!

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.770
Lady Tsunade and everyone else are worried about you!

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.800
Oww… Sakura! Let me eat my ramen!

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.330
That can wait.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.770
With the Great Lord Elder?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.900
Yeah, he used a Reverse Summoning Jutsu.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.330
Jeez, after all the trouble…

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.770
Lord Fukasaku could at least notify me first.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.730
Still, it's a relief that you're okay, Naruto.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.100
Yup, I'm alive and well.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.800
But why did the Great Lord Elder summon you?

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.830
Giant Gramps Sage had a prophecy for me too.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.000
Like the one he foretold to Jiraiya?

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.030
What did the Great Lord Elder say?

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.130
Well… What's the matter?

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.830
I'm gonna go to some resort and encounter an octopus.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.230
Huh? An octopus?

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.900
What is that supposed to mean?

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.370
Well, this octopus is gonna cooperate with me somehow.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.870
Giant Gramps Sage didn't know the details either.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.930
And…

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.600
he said that I'm going to end up fighting Sasuke.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.330
Sasuke?

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.430
But I'm already prepared for that.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.570
Naruto…

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.130
Sakura, it's all right.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.430
Just let me deal with Sasuke.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.000
It's quiet.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.230
I know.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.900
So peaceful.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.530
Huh? No, it's not.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.470
Well sure, the village that Pain destroyed is being rebuilt,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.570
and Lady Tsunade has come out of her coma.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.570
But as for Sasuke,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.570
there's only talk that Naruto will do something.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.370
And there's gonna be a war, right?

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.800
How did you know that?

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.600
I'm not stupid. I can tell by watching the jonin.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.570
I guess so.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.770
The fact is war is right at our doorstep.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.300
I see… I figured as much.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.330
Yeah. This is fight is going to be something we…

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.670
I mean, no shinobi has ever experienced.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.430
I mean, the Five Great Nations are joining forces for the first time

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.000
to crush the Akatsuki.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.270
It's the start of the Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.800
The Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.370
Aren't you scared, Shikamaru?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.370
Sure, I'm scared.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.470
But this time,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.530
it doesn't matter how scared we are or how hard it'll be.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.100
Our enemy, the Akatsuki, is made up of members so skilled

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.500
that it took just one of them, Pain, to destroy Hidden Leaf Village.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.970
And the abilities of their leader, Madara, are shrouded in mystery.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.470
Madara already has seven Tailed Beasts in his possession.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.630
If he unleashes all of them at once,

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.800
who knows if the Five Great Nations can win.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.270
The very existence of the ninja world is at stake.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.430
Each and every shinobi will have to do his best

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.500
in order for us to win.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.230
Choji, I'm counting on your strength!

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.100
Shikamaru… I wonder if I can do my best?

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.300
Still, it's hard to take this all in, huh?

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:34.770
Are you okay?

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.830
You wanted to know what to expect from war.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.300
I'm fine.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.670
But nothing can prepare you for the real battlefield.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.600
The cries of the wounded, the smell of blood…

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.470
It's impossible not to be affected by that.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.770
And yet, a Medical Ninja must maintain composure at all times.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.270
Everyone fights hard,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.300
believing that we will be there to save their lives.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.930
I understand.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.070
That's why I wanted to…

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.330
to know.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.070
Well, I've rambled on enough.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.330
Damn it. A poor talker like me lecturing you, it’s not my style.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.170
If we both end up dying…

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.970
You won’t be an Uchiha and I won’t be the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.600
We'll be free of all our burdens.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.630
And we'll finally be able to understand each other in the next world.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.100
Naruto…you…

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.900
If both Naruto and Sasuke are seriously wounded…

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.670
which one will I save first?

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.430
Found you!

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.630
Be quiet!

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.630
Master, what's the meaning of this?

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.070
Don't scare us like that.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.800
I'm Killer - Bee - Quiet!

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.100
That has a nice cadence.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.200
– And… – What is it?

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.100
ENKA CONCERT

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.700
These are for us?

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.370
To sell?!

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.300
I had interference from Brother in that last recital.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.970
This time, I'm gonna nail it.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.700
A recital?

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.570
Who's gonna wanna buy these?

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.170
Are you that against hearing me sing?

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.030
You fools! You idiots!

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.300
No, it's not that…

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.100
Okay, Master! I'll sell tickets even if it kills me!

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.700
I'm counting on you!

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.770
You all came quickly.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.170
The situation calls for quick action.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.770
Princess Tsunade. Are you really all right?

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.870
This is the perfect opportunity to hand things over to a youngster.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.900
You're old too.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.500
Speak for yourself, you Fence-Sitter geezer!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Setting aside the matter of Danzo,

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.870
I'm relieved that you are back as the Hokage, Lady Tsunade.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.900
Let us be done with the greetings and get right to business.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.530
First on the agenda are

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.100
the Jinchuriki of the Eight Tails and Nine Tails.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.370
Then we will go on to any intel

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.830
relating to the enemy's headquarters and military strength.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.070
My shinobi have pinned down a location

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.900
that may be the enemy’s stronghold.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.000
But it may be a trap.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.070
We have no choice but to wait for more intel on this.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.830
I also have a reconnaissance team gathering intel.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.270
We need to sort through the intel from each village quickly.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.170
How about forming a separate unit within the Allied Force

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.330
that only handles intel?

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.770
Good idea! Share and share alike!

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.500
That goes without saying!

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:12.500
If each nation becomes driven by self-interest,

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.800
the Akatsuki will pull the rug out from under us.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.330
So, where will we hide the crucial Jinchuriki?

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.330
Hide them?

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.030
What is it?

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.600
Naruto and Bee can lend much strength to this battle.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.030
Why hide them away?

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.900
I thought so as well.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.830
But those two are what the enemy is after in this war.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.470
Considering what could happen, we cannot let them participate.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.200
It was decided at the last meeting,

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.570
but you, of course, were still ill.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.730
Our enemy is Madara!

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.430
If we hold back battle strength and lose the prospect of victory,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.330
we are not going to get another chance.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.000
We must hit them with everything we've got…

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.300
The Five Great Nations joined together and

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.400
our aim in this war is to protect those two.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.200
Your sole dissent as Hokage is not sufficient.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.100
We will decide this with majority rule.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.830
You child! Naruto is—

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.470
I know him quite well.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.930
Putting us through all this trouble!

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.330
If it's for a friend, he gets too reckless.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.030
That is exactly why.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.600
Before we even talk about military strength,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.570
the five Kage must reach a consensus.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.170
Otherwise, there will be no victory.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.130
I agree, Lady Tsunade.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.200
It's fine!

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.470
The Slug Princess is back to her impudent self.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.930
It's proof that she is well.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.200
We will now need to decide where to hide

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.730
the Eight Tails and Nine Tails.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.900
Any objections, Hokage?

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.070
I understand. Get on with it!

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.800
I have a place in mind.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.430
And it is appropriately located in the Hidden Cloud,

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.930
which has not produced any Akatsuki members.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.100
I set it aside, just in case.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.630
Why do you need to speak in private?

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.600
I need a favor.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:15.870
A favor?

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.230
I understand that your younger brother, Bee,

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.800
has the Eight Tails completely under control.

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.170
I want Bee to teach Naruto.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.730
About how to control the Nine Tails.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.700
How convenient for you.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.530
If that brat named Naruto learns

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.170
to completely manipulate the Nine Tails

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.700
he will be the ultimate weapon for the Hidden Leaf.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.400
And you want me to readily agree to that?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.800
I know all that.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:50.330
But this is not the time to be arguing about our own interests!

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.830
We are up against Madara Uchiha!

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.970
The time will come when we will have no choice

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.400
but to use Bee and Naruto's powers!

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.730
It will be too late if we wait until then!

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.600
Don't shout so much.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.430
Is that any way to make a request?

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.870
I’m sorry.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.570
You have a point though.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.770
And, I considered that ages ago.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.030
What?! What are you saying?

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.270
The place I'm sending those two isn't just a hideout.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.130
I said I set it aside, didn’t I?

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:30.570
Long ago, Bee and I trained on that island.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.300
S-rank mission?!

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.500
You're assigning me to an important mission like that?

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.330
Yes. This is a mission that only you can undertake.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.830
You and Yamato will go to a certain place

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.330
in the Hidden Cloud region.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.230
Is that the resort?

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.430
The Great Lord Elder's prophecy was accurate.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.030
It seems that is the place he foresaw.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.370
Then I'm gonna see the octopus at this resort island?

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.500
I feel sorta bad!

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.370
Everyone's so busy and I get to go to a resort.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.170
You fool! You are going on a mission!

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.930
I know. Just joking, just joking.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.400
But about going to this place that was prophesied…

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.700
Is it connected to the other one?

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.270
That I'll fight with Sasuke?

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.130
That, I don't know.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.930
However, we are on the verge of war!

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.300
Hence, this S-rank mission.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.000
When you get to the site, you will follow Yamato's orders.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.800
Okay! I understand!

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.330
You can count on me for this S-rank mission!

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.130
Dress casually for enka.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.000
Yup, I look pretty good.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.370
Where is Bee?!

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.570
W-What's up, Brother?!

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.030
You surprised me too much.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.130
You're going on a mission. Leave immediately!

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.800
What's with that get-up?!

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:07.970
Let's go!

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.200
The concert is in three days.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.930
PASSION ON FIRE LIVE ENKA CONCERT TICKETS ON SALE NOW No way we can sell these.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.030
If we don't sell them…

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:26.400
It'll be "You fools. You idiots. You worthless jerks."

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.230
And we'll end up tied to the front-row seats

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.430
and forced to listen to Master's singing forever.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.870
We'll end up with calluses on our ears.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.300
Okay! So we just have to sell the tickets, right?!

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:49.400
But if we do sell them all, he'll be so grateful

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.430
he'll still give us first-row seats and

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.970
we'll have to listen to Master sing for the rest of our lives,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.530
and we'll still get calluses!

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.300
So do we sell the tickets or not?!

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.200
I don't know what to do either!

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.800
The time has finally come.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.330
Just as Giant Gramps Sage prophesied.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.500
I’m going to go search for an octopus and

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.700
train to learn how to control the Nine Tails’ power.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.230
And see Sasuke again.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.270
Naruto, are you ready?

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.530
Yes!

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.900
Hey young man. We depart now!

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.900
Next time: "The Young Man and the Sea"

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.800
We’ll set sail for the Land of Lightning!

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.870
Tune in again!
