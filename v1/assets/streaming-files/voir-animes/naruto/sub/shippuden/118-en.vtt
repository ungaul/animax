WEBVTT

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.600
How dare they turn our village into a mess!

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.070
Konohamaru!

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.070
Udon! Moegi!

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.100
Just in time.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.300
We're gonna save this village from this disaster!

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.770
What? But we just managed to run away.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.030
Brother Naruto is away.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.630
So it's our duty to protect the village!

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.700
Yeah, but there's nothing we can do against such powerful monsters!

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.000
I'll just blast 'em with the new jutsu

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.670
that Brother Naruto taught me!

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.270
New jutsu?!

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.570
It's probably the usual Pervy Ninjutsu, right?

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.870
No, it's not!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.030
Konohamaru!

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.600
There's a jutsu I want to teach you!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.800
What's with you all of a sudden?

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.030
Well, I... Um... How can I put it?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.700
It's time I pass things on to others, instead of being passed down to.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.600
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.000
Don't tell me he came up with some awesome Pervy Ninjutsu?!

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.130
A-Anyway! The jutsu I'm gonna teach you is on a whole new level!

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.370
Just hurry up and teach it to me!

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.700
I wonder what kind of amazing Pervy Ninjutsu it is.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.230
Listen up. First step is "rotation"!

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.970
Whoa! We're going to add motion, eh?!

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.330
And next is "power"!

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.000
Attack with the risqué, eh?!

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.400
And then finally, there is... There's even more?!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Containment!

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.830
The most points go to the best expression, eh?!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.370
What are you talking about?

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.130
At first, I also thought this was a Pervy Ninjutsu...

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.900
But it's different!

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.870
With this jutsu, I can go on high-ranking missions!

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.670
What kind of high-ranking missions?!

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.300
At a time like this, we have things that we must do.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.970
She's right, Konohamaru.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.470
It's our duty to guide and evacuate the civilians!

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.300
We're supposed to evacuate the children and those who cannot fight, huh?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.630
Yes! I'm going to check out how things are in Block C.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.270
Right! I'll check on Block E.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.670
Then I'm going to Block B!

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.830
I'll make sure there's no one who didn't make it out!

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.300
Be careful now, Konohamaru!

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.100
Anyone?! Is anyone here?!

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.830
Anyone!

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.470
Help me!

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.870
Where? Where are you?!

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.270
Are you all right?!

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.300
Hang on!

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.700
How could they do this?!

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.830
If we can't merge, I have no choice

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.170
but to pull in Nature Energy while I'm moving!

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.130
And I said that's impossible!

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.870
I never imagined this would happen after coming this far.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.670
I'm not giving up!

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.770
If that's what it takes, then I'll keep at it until it works!

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.800
But I'm saying it's impossible!

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.400
I-I'm sorry...

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.400
I know this is hard to accept, but it's physically impossible.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.770
That code on your back was a message to me from the Pervy Sage.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.470
Yes, I know that.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.200
And thanks to you, Naruto-boy,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.970
it's become a key to solving the mystery of Pain--

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.900
Not just that.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.670
It's also a message for me not to give up until the very end.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.900
But still...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.900
I'm Pervy Sage's student.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.570
And if that message was my master's Ninja Way...then I...

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.170
I have no business whining!

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.990
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.080
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.500
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.420
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.220
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.520
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.730
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.360
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:43.990
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.990
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:51.160
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:59.380
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.880
koete Someday...

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.200
Surname is Sarutobi! Given Name, Konohamaru!

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.130
Thank you...

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.900
You'll be all right now.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.900
That mark...

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.430
It's the gang that killed Uncle Asuma... The Akatsuki!

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.530
Is Naruto Uzumaki here in the village or not? Which is it?

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.030
Naruto?!

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.700
He's...a member of the village.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.970
We would never sell out a comrade!

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.630
The Will of Fire, eh?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.570
What?!

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.530
If you do not answer my question, it is over for you.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.400
I will ask you one more time.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.270
What is this?

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.600
Is Naruto Uzumaki here in the village or not? Which is it?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.600
I know nothing!

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.900
So get lost!

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.200
We don't know a thing! Let us go!

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.900
I see... Then I shall pass judgment.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.200
It seems you truly did not know.

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.400
Wh-What's going on?!

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.270
He didn't do a thing and yet the guy on the left stopped moving?!

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.730
What did he do?!

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.600
Was the chunin fellow killed without

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.500
being able to defend himself at all?

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.070
I-I'd better get away from here. It's too dangerous!

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Oh no! Is he on to me?!

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.070
It seems you went ahead to do as you please!

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.230
I have no mercy for scum like you!

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.630
Ebisu Sensei!

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.930
Now is your chance to get away, Konohamaru!

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.900
Where do you think you're looking?!

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.930
It'll take more than that to kill me!

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.000
Ebisu Sensei...

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.900
I must buy some time to allow Konohamaru to escape!

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.500
Wh-What'll I do? What'll I do?!

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.570
How can I...?

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.870
Good... He got away.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.400
I messed up...

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.400
But I've done what I needed to do.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.170
Is Naruto Uzumaki here in the village, or not?

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.670
If you know, speak up.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.930
N-Naruto?

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.270
Brother Naruto?!

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.870
It seems you do know Naruto Uzumaki.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.870
Then tell me where he is.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.100
I may...not look it...

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.330
but I do hold the elite rank of instructor.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.430
Naruto is my student.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.000
Long ago, I considered him a nuisance.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.800
who stood in the way of Konohamaru's rise to Hokage.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.830
That's what I believed...

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.500
However, Naruto didn't allow his cursed fate to discourage him.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.430
With unending optimism and a never-say-die attitude

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.370
he faced one challenge after another and overcame them.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.930
The important lessons which I could not teach,

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.770
despite being an instructor,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.970
Naruto taught them to my students.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.930
You...have rambled on too long.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.700
This is your last chance.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:50.030
Do you know where Naruto is, or don't you?

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.230
Answer me! Or else I'll kill you.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.400
Naruto... You...

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.830
You will overcome the death of your master

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.170
and carry on his legacy.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.330
The strong will you possess will teach Konohamaru...

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.300
no, everyone in the village, many things.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.930
Naruto is a member of the Hidden Leaf!

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:24.230
I have no intention of telling you Akatsuki anything!

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.570
Ebisu Sensei!

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.470
I see... Then...

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.670
Brother Naruto...

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.430
When people look at me or call out to me,

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.070
they only see me as the grandson of the Hokage.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.600
And I'm sick of it!

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.430
That's why I want the title of Hokage right now!

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.470
It's not easy, stupid!

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.870
You keep harping on about the Hokage.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.570
If you want that title so badly...

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.630
you can have it over my dead body!

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.700
Then starting now...we're rivals!

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.830
One day, we'll fight over the name of Hokage.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:23.170
So look forward to that day, Konohamaru!

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.000
I guess this is the end of the road.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.430
I hope that Konohamaru was able to escape.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.100
Die...

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.470
I'll take you on!

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.930
I was taught that...

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.400
there's no shortcut in the world of the ninja!

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.530
Konohamaru! Why didn't you run away?!

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.830
You have the potential to one day become a Hokage!

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.000
Do not waste your life in a place like this!

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.300
I made a promise long ago.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.330
To fight Brother Naruto over the title of Hokage...

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.530
That's what we promised.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.470
Brother Naruto is my rival!

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.970
So I'll never choose to run away!

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.130
Because Brother Naruto won't be waiting at the end of that short path!

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.500
So fast!

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.230
One thing's certain. If he catches me, I'm dead.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.930
If I'm caught, he'll kill me with some special jutsu.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.900
Konohamaru!

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.430
S-Sensei!

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.230
Is Naruto Uzumaki here in the village or not? Which is it?

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.630
I get it... So this is what you see if you get caught.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.530
Now, answer me.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.330
It seems you truly did not know.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.430
I'm starting to figure out...his ability.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.530
I don't have a clue!

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.000
Konohamaru?!

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.930
B-Brother Naruto...

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.500
Konohamaru! There's a jutsu I want to teach you!

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.130
It's an A-Rank level jutsu in terms of difficulty to master.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.800
I see. Then I shall pass judgment...

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.430
A Shadow Clone?!

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.570
Super advanced ninjutsu that combines

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.970
chakra rotation, power, and containment...

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.370
- Rasengan! - Rasengan!

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.830
Wh-When did he learn...such a...?

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.400
I am a genin of the Sarutobi clan,

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.900
honored with the name of this village!

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.400
Surname is Sarutobi! Given name is Konohamaru!

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.230
Remember that!

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.170
Oww!

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.200
Not just yet!

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.800
Let's keep on going!

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.070
This training is not for everyone...

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.670
You could say it's only possible because it's you and Jiraiya-boy.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.800
Or else I wouldn't have even brought you here.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.630
Unless you already possess enormous chakra inside you,

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.200
Nature Energy would just take over you right away.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.900
Plus, they must have the guts to never give up.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.400
That's the kind of person who can become a Sage.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.100
He's so stubborn...

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.100
Let's take a break, Naruto-boy.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.700
Otherwise, I won't be able to keep up.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.430
That's no good! We have to keep going to make up

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.770
for the time we spent on the training up until now!

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:39.100
Look, you've never had this kind of training before.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.000
To run and gather Nature Energy,

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.170
for which the foundation is being still,

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.630
is like telling you to look to the left, when you are looking to the right.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:56.970
What is it?

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.700
You all push death out of your thoughts.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:47.670
In battle, both sides suffer death, injury, and pain.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.970
Feel pain. Contemplate pain.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:55.100
Accept pain. Know pain.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.370
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Pain to the World"

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.300
Almighty Push!

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.230
INN OKOSHI MEN'S BATH WOMEN'S BATH

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.030
This time, for sure, I'll use my sex appeal to get Sasuke.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.570
This should be okay!

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.570
What's okay?

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:31.730
If you insist, Sasuke... I'll wash your back.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.800
No thanks.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.030
Aww, c'mon, don't be so boring.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.900
This is sheer heaven...

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.430
What the hell are you doing, Suigetsu?!

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.030
I'd ask the same of you!

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.130
Huh?! I just happen to...

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.800
I mean...well... None of your business!

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.270
Damn it... It was the perfect opportunity.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.830
Oh well... At least I got this...

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.470
Sasuke, have you seen my toothbrush?

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.000
Tune in again!
