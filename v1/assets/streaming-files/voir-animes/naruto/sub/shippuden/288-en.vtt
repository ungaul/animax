00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.160
The State of Affairs

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.420
FIRE So, I told my classmates…

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.460
that they were lucky to have so much free time.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.630
It's been a month since I got here.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.100
Isn't it about time I get to supervise a big assignment on my own?

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.890
Oh, Lord Hokage!

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.640
Where was yesterday's report again?

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.730
Third pile to the right, the second one.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.530
Oh, here it is.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.700
Didn't this come with some attachments?

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.570
Second pile, the third one.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.740
I don't know what I'd do without you.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.490
Oh right, Lord Hokage.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.450
About next week's inspection…

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.370
I keep telling you to just call me Kakashi.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.500
You're way too stiff and formal, senpai!

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.380
And don't forget to take a break.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.510
Efficiency gets compromised if you don't.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.890
Roger!

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.020
Anyway…

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.440
I didn't become a shinobi to be chained to a desk.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.900
How do you not get bored doing this sort of work, senpai?

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.320
Uh, senpai?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.450
I haven't looked up at the clouds in a long time.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.790
You know, senpai, sometimes you talk like an old man.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.420
Is something bothering you?

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.210
Huh?

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.170
No.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.890
And, I'm done for the day!

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.720
Man!

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.730
We cruised through today!

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.230
Thanks, and see ya tomorrow!

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.860
Oh, Lord Hokage!

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.480
Thanks, and see ya tomorrow!

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.900
See ya…

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.150
Thanks for today.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.740
Why'd you pick a guy like that?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.700
The adult world is complicated.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.870
I don't like that kind of stuff.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.500
Oh?

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.090
I thought you became one of us a while back.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.920
Give me a break!

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.970
Having more shinobi like him just goes to show we're at peace.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.760
It's been two years since then.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.470
I'm starting to get a belly…

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.850
I don't want to hear it.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.770
Do you keep up with training?

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.820
Here and there.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.690
You say it like that,

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.780
but I bet you're as disciplined as ever.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.820
Why can't you just humor me a bit?

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.570
I told him to double-check it!

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.160
By the way, how is it going?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.620
Regarding that issue.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.870
It's on the back-burner.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.830
No contact then?

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.710
I feel bad burdening you with it.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.760
I was never really cut out to be a shinobi.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.760
The fact that I continue to be one…

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.180
Is to make Naruto the Hokage one day, right?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.480
To make sure that happens, I can't be a child forever.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.230
Naruto's still a child, even now.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.900
He is who he is.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.070
Oh… How about we go grab a bite after you're done?

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.620
After this, Lord Tsuchikage and I have a game.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.740
Oh right, I saw him at the conference yesterday.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.080
All he talked about was how he would beat you this time.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.620
Anyway, please go easy on him.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.000
Well, half of it is work for me.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.880
Hey, Shikamaru…

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.180
I wonder what it means to become an adult?

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.850
No, wait… This one?

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.860
How's that, young 'un? You're speechless now, eh?

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.910
Please excuse me…

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.660
Hey, don't think I'll let you win and run!

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.630
Tsk… I have to work twice as hard tomorrow.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.880
HIDDEN LEAF LIBRARY

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.770
BARBE-Q BARBE-Q  Welcome!

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.770
Oh, there he is!

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.400
Over here!

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.900
Sorry I'm late.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.570
That's the meat I was grilling!

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.620
Here you go.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.120
This one's done too.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.290
Another order of kalbi please!

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.750
Anyway, I keep teaching this newbie and she just doesn't get it.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.880
There's one on my team too.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.050
He reminds me of myself and I just can't ignore him.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.340
I wonder if Asuma felt this way.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.550
You two have totally embraced your roles as instructors.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.470
Well, you're Lord Hokage's right-hand man, aren't you?

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:02.060
But I don't have anyone under me to mentor.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.110
You're the type that prefers to just do things yourself.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.110
Being a loner suits me.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.490
You two are the only ones who are special to me.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.620
I miss the old days.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.370
Hey, we're not old enough to be saying that.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.370
Back then, it was normal for us to be together 24/7.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.710
Now, we have to set up a time and date just to eat together.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.510
It's kinda sad, huh?

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.930
Maybe that's what it means to become an adult.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.930
That's for sure. Your temperament's changed.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.140
Huh? You've got to be kidding.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.400
Lately, you never say, "what a drag."

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.690
Haven't you noticed?

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.690
Really?

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.450
BARBE-Q – Thanks for the food! – Thank you!

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.240
They gave me gum when I was at the register.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.870
Doesn't this bring back memories?

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.950
GUM Doesn't this bring back memories?

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.200
I always chewed this when I was a kid!

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.790
Oh, it's so sweet! Was it always this sweet?

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.830
Okay, where to next?

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.880
You still wanna eat more?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.510
Let's go BBQ hopping!

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.720
Sorry, I have to go.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.840
Huh?!

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.390
Shikamaru… Is something on your mind?

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.930
Your mind seems to be wandering.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.440
It's nothing.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.230
I have to leave the village for work, on Allied Shinobi business.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.900
Is it the same thing Temari and Kankuro attend?

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.870
So Temari is more important than us?

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.740
Oww… What're you talking about?

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.000
SAMURAI And so, we hope that it grows even more.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.880
That concludes my activity report.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.000
Are there any other questions?

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.220
Regarding the long list of missing persons after the Great War…

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.050
How is the search going?

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.430
It's currently under investigation.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.020
How about the drop in shinobi requests for three consecutive periods?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.020
It's currently under investigation.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.980
You know, if it keeps dropping,

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.730
it'll affect how we administer the villages.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:17.110
We should have a more detailed report by the next meeting.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.580
I understand the view

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.660
that a decrease in requests for shinobi poses a concern.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.920
But remember, this is a consequence of peace.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.170
If there are no more questions,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.880
we'll meet again in one month.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.840
Hey! Wait, Shikamaru!

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.140
What's going on, Temari?

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.640
You're hiding something, aren't you?

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.150
Huh? What makes you say that?

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.480
See?

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.480
When you answer a question with a question,

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.320
it's proof that something's up.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.740
What's going on in the Hidden Leaf Village?

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.240
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.870
It's something you can't talk to me about?

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.910
I said there's nothing going on!

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.290
So there's nothing I can help with?

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.710
Nope.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.420
I see…

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.040
Hey, Temari…

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.670
Both you and I are representatives of our villages…

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.680
We shouldn't pry too much into the other's—

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.890
What the hell—?!

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.100
I misjudged you!

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.820
So that's what made you remember your old man.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.780
Yes.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.490
He often got yelled at by my mom for staying out all night.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.410
Sorry you had to go through that.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.660
Temari is very intuitive.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.290
She's going to find out sooner or later

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.000
about the Land of Silence.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.670
Many of the missing from the Great War

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.130
and Rogue Ninja are filtering into this mysterious land.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.510
And there's a deep, dark rumor

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.300
that it's undertaking shinobi missions illegally.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.680
By rights, the Shinobi Alliance should deal with this problem.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.930
It'll be troublesome if they find out that

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.060
we're independently investigating this.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.770
But taking action on the Land of Silence

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.020
in the name of the alliance will be touchy.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.990
Just when we finally achieved peace.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.160
It's already been two weeks since Sai left word

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.950
that he was infiltrating the Land of Silence, right?

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.990
We can't just stand by without taking action any further.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.790
It's finally here.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.600
The state of affairs is more serious than we previously thought.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.470
If the Land of Silence is left to continue as is,

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.850
the Shinobi Alliance will be threatened at some point.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.520
There is one leader at work in this land.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.940
His name is… Gengo.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.070
I've never heard that name before.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.570
It's possible, he will become the one

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.490
who may very well change the pitiful existence of shinobi…

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.750
In fact, he may change the whole framework of this world.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.120
I don't even know myself anymore…

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.040
This isn't good.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.630
Right?

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.550
Sai led a team of ten,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.090
comprised of the cream of the crop among the ANBU.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.010
It would take a formidable enemy to wipe them out…

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.050
Probably…

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.430
Sai's instincts were right.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.980
Many of the shinobi who disappeared after the Great War

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.770
and Rogue Shinobi are in the Land of Silence.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.070
I hope Sai is all right.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.900
He's not one to get killed so easily, but…

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.990
There are hints in his message that sound

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.990
like admiration for this man named Gengo.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.160
You don't think Sai has…?

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.620
He's very pure hearted, so…

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.580
If we're to get Sai out of there

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.210
and nip the Land of Silence in the bud…

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.090
we have just one option.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.550
Could we be thinking the same thing?

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:05.720
Yes.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.930
However, you can't go.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.390
Right…

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.270
To go unnoticed, a three-man squad will be best.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.650
Could you get two good shinobi from the ANBU?

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.610
A three-man squad…

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.730
You already have someone in mind for the third member?

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.950
What we're attempting is

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.950
a clear breach of faith toward the alliance.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.370
If worse comes to worst,

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.870
we would have to disavow any knowledge of this team.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.200
I'll go.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.870
You carry a big part of the responsibilities within the alliance.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.960
You can't… I'm simply adding another job to my plate.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.210
It's useless to try to stop you, isn't it?

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.930
Still, I would have thought you'd pick Ino and Choji.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.350
For this mission,

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:56.060
we need someone who can control chakra and can hide us.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.900
And someone who has a jutsu to make a direct hit on the target.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.190
Besides… Besides?

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.530
Those two have their own lives now.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.280
I think I know just the ANBU for this.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.240
They're both easy to work with…

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.870
So I'm sure you'll like them.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.620
SHIKAMARU SHIKAMARU  What?

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.580
Going on a business trip, senpai?

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.000
Yeah, take care of things here for me.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.920
It must be nice!

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.090
I wish I could go too!

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.720
Damn it.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.220
Please bring me back a souvenir!

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.760
Yeah sure, I will.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.970
This is Soku of the ANBU.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.270
Easy to work with, huh?

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.360
And where's the other one?

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.070
I am right here.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:45.690
When did you—?

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.150
He's Ro.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.860
He has the ability to freely manipulate his own and others' chakra

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.950
to erase all signs of his presence or become another person.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.790
If I were to put it simply,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.830
it's a modification of the chakra from

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.880
the point of view of what others perceive.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:06.550
I do not actually increase the chakra of the target,

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.010
I create an anachronism in their perception.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:11.970
Like, that's even more confusing.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.430
This one's still a kid.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.760
Like, unthinkable, right?

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.520
In the world of shinobi, ability is, like, everything.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.850
You don't mince words.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.850
After the Academy,

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.150
we noticed Hinoko's talents and scouted her for the ANBU.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.230
She's only 14,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.320
but she's already highly regarded in the ANBU.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.570
I asked you to like, not to use my real name, Lord Hokage.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.200
Your name's Hinoko?

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.410
That's a really cute na—!

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.870
I, like, hate to be called that name.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.460
I'd like you to be careful about that.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.960
So, what can you do?

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.130
My weapon is a chakra needle.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.840
Once my needle hones in on a target,

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.760
it will not stop its pursuit until, it like, pierces its target.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.230
Very suitable for assassination.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.270
I don't like, needlessly kill.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.700
I pierced its chakra stimulation point,

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.780
so it's like, several times more livelier now.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.870
We'll infiltrate using Ro's jutsu,

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.910
then I'll immobilize the target with my Shadow Strangle Jutsu,

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.580
and Soku will finish him.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:28.800
A true collaboration indeed. The synergy in this plan is ideal.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.630
Like, that sounds tedious.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.720
They're exactly what you wanted.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.930
I have no objections…

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.010
Then, like, what's the issue?

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.270
Can you drop the "like" thing?

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.430
Like, absolutely not.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.140
Well, it's decided. So once everything's ready—

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.770
Would it be okay to leave tomorrow morning?

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.900
It's not shogi again, is it?

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.320
I have some business to take care of.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.280
So anyway, looks like

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.450
SHIKAKU NARA I'll be heading back a bit later, so I won't be able to visit next month.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.500
I have two subordinates under me.

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.080
It's not like me, huh?

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.630
ASUMA SARUTOBI

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:20.560
Both you and my dad had someone you'd give your lives to protect.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.020
But, I haven't found anyone like that yet…

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.640
Big Brother Shika!

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:28.900
Mirai!

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440
Big Brother Shika!

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.690
Whoa, there!

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.700
Shikamaru, you're so busy these days,

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.950
you don't need to come every month.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.410
I'm not that busy.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.040
This is our babysitter.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.790
She occasionally watches Mirai for me.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.790
Hello.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.550
He may not look it, but he's Lord Hokage's right-hand man.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.550
Please… Oh, I see!

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.720
I'm sorry, I still don't know these things yet.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.930
She just started living here.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.020
People are moving into this village

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.270
all because of people like you and the Lord Hokage.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:08.980
Please, don't mention it.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.610
I hope this peace will last for a long time.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.360
ASUMA SARUTOBI Big Brother!

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:17.780
Flowers!

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.070
Oh really? You brought them for your daddy?

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.080
You're so clever, Mirai!

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.790
Mirai, you really love Big Brother Shikamaru, don't you?

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.210
Uh-huh!

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.170
This peace will last.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.090
I'll make it last.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.480
Why now?

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.140
Damn it!

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.060
Such bad luck.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.870
Hey, Shikamaru!

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.620
You're up awfully early.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Naruto…

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.750
I could say the same about you.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.750
I got up and couldn't go back to sleep…

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.090
I'm on my way home from Ichiraku Ramen.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.930
That shop opens that early?

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.890
It's open 24 hours now!

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.930
Yeah but, who eats ramen for breakfast?

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.140
I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.100
Half of my body's made of ramen!

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.980
Hmm? Do I smell like garlic?

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.320
Oh…

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.990
Chew this.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.570
GUM

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.410
This brings back memories!

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.200
I love this stuff!

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.410
See ya.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:51.960
Work?

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.790
Yeah, just a little.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.840
Don't just sit around and eat ramen.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.050
Do some work.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.760
Well, a certain someone somewhere

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.050
keeps assigning me annoying missions…

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.090
So I won't have a break for the next six months.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.720
This is the most critical time in your life.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.890
I know that.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:10.680
But you know—

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.140
No buts!

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.060
Take on as many missions as possible,

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.110
make it so everyone says,

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.030
"It has to be Naruto, no one else will do."

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.070
If you think they acknowledge you now

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.910
because you're the hero of the Great War, you're wrong.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.700
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.160
– Hey, Naruto. – Hmm?

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.870
You're going to become the Hokage.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.080
Don't ever forget that.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.540
I never go back on my word.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.380
That's my Ninja Way.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.590
You mean "our" way.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.090
Yeah.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.260
Naruto… Always stay just the way you are.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.810
That's the reason why I'm here.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.900
Anyway… I guess it's time to go to work.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.250
I humbly guarantee that

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.170
we will be able to deceive the enemy's eyes with this.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.920
Like, if we kill all of the lookouts,

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.880
it will be easy to pass through the checkpoint.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.680
It would spell trouble if we do that

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.890
and they found out the Leaf's involved.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.350
Don't underestimate the enemy.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:54.760
If we linger too long,

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.430
we'll only like, up the chances of the enemy noticing us.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.890
Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.570
"Shikamaru's Story, A Cloud Drifting in the Silent Dark, Part 2: Dark Clouds"

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.240
Soku, trust me.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:18.700
Tune in again!
