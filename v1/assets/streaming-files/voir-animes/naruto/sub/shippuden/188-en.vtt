WEBVTT

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.150
What's wrong?

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.190
The enemy is disguising themselves as allies!

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.610
Maybe you're an enemy!

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.440
We can't trust anyone!

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.900
What's going on?!

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.230
There's murkiness spreading everywhere!

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.570
G-Granny?!

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.360
No! B-Bro… B-Bra…

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.030
Bee!

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.480
How dare you stare at the Hokage's chest

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.900
when I'm standing right in front of you!

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.530
Oh no, Bro! I meant no offense. I'm just shocked, is all.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.530
The Hokage's jugs are definitely immense.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.530
We're here to stop you!

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.610
You will not pass!

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.610
The Secret Origin of the Ultimate Tag Team

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.570
So this is what Naruto looks like when

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.400
he's in control of the Nine Tails' power…

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.480
You did it, Naruto.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.820
S-Such immense chakra!

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.400
Bro!

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.780
Let Naruto go… This is a personal plea.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.480
I can vouch for him. That I'll guarantee.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.530
Silence! We are fighting this war to protect you two!

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.530
If you guys are captured…

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.570
The enemy has perfected their jutsu and the world is about to end.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.570
Isn't that right? Iruka Sensei told us!

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.400
If you know that, why are you going?

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.940
Are you crazy?!

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.440
It's because of that!

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.030
It's because they're protecting us!

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.320
I can't stand it that people are dying for me!

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.070
If they die fighting and we win this war…

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.400
and I'm the only left standing… It's not worth it!

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.360
I don't want that!

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.360
It's better than the world ending!

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.820
We all believe that. That's why we're fighting,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.690
prepared to sacrifice ourselves to protect you!

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.480
You think that I can just sit here,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.400
unharmed and do nothing when I know that?

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.070
I'm not that kind of a guy!

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.400
Besides…

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.440
Don't try to talk your way out! You will not pass!

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.690
If you won't listen to me…

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.610
Can you keep up with me in this Mode?

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.360
What is that punch? Damn, it's powerful!

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.030
I'd better avoid a direct hit.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.230
Granny Tsunade, you understand me, don't you?!

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.780
I'll stop this war!

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.360
Let me go!

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.360
Granny…

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.190
We are now part of the Allied Shinobi Force.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.030
These orders are from the Allied Forces.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.480
Even though I am the Hokage, I cannot act independently!

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.980
Okay. I understand the position you're in, Granny.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.190
So, I'll force my way outta here!

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.530
This time, I'll do it faster.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.820
How's this?!

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.400
You're fast, old man Raikage…

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.400
No…

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.570
It's amazing that when you're in Nine-Tail Chakra Mode,

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.820
you can match the Raikage's speed.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.280
There's no shinobi faster than me.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.940
Not since the Fourth Hokage!

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.570
You knew my dad?!

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.860
We fought many times.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.730
I came to believe that no one could ever defeat him.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.440
FOURTH HOKAGE I understand that Jiraiya of the Legendary Sannin

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.570
FOURTH HOKAGE called him the Child of Prophecy… the savior of the world.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.690
So why is this savior not around to stop this crisis?

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.030
Because he failed during the incident of the Nine Tails!

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.440
You are his son, yet you haven't learned anything from that.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.730
Only a fool speaks without knowing the probability…

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.360
If that's all…

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.070
If that's all you can say, don't talk about my dad.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.030
And you were born.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.480
Minato cried and said, "From today, I'm a father!"

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.530
And…

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.070
His words were, "I'd gladly die for my son."

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.650
He sealed half of the overpowering chakra

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.480
of the Nine Tails in himself.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.900
The upheaval in the world…

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.530
Dealing with the calamity and Madara…

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.980
He left it to his son.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.730
Naruto, he entrusted everything to you and died.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.860
My dad…

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.480
He believed in you with all his heart.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.360
The Fourth Hokage did not fail!

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.190
If you…insist on going…

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.190
I will kill you right here!

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.110
Wha—?! Hey, Raikage!

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.480
This way, we'll be able to buy some time

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.070
until the Nine Tails is revived.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.940
And the enemy will be forced to postpone their plans!

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.280
Looks like you want to die.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.440
Wait!

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.150
Bee, you…!

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.820
Oh… He was saved!

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.610
If that's the case, why don't I, the Eight Tails, die?

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.610
Then the enemy's plans will also go awry.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.030
If Naruto can go to the battlefield… my life is one I'd gladly yield.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.440
Octopops…

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.110
Raikage!

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.940
You cannot make any arbitrary decisions

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.900
without consulting the other Allied Shinobi Force leaders.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.280
You may be the Supreme Commander, but I will not allow it!

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.860
My responsibility is to make sure we win this war!

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.400
No matter what it takes!

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.070
Then as Eight Tails said, why are you targeting Naruto?

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.860
When the time comes, as Raikage,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.900
I will be prepared to kill my own younger brother!

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.480
But right now… I choose to kill Naruto over Bee!

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.440
Because Bee is the Jinchuriki

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.860
who is able to control the Tailed Beast's power…

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.610
That makes him a stronger military weapon!

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.570
Unhand me, Bee!

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.440
No way, fool ya fool!

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.360
You and Jinchuriki like you do not exist solely for yourselves!

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.610
You maintain the balance of power between nations.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.150
You are the strength of your village!

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.820
To the all the nations and your village, you are a special existence!

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.480
You can't just do as you please!

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.780
You must understand the circumstances, you fools!

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.480
Sure, that may be so…

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.610
But there's something personal called spirit that I can't abandon…

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.150
Without that, I'm just another weapon.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.530
Why are you defending him, Bee?

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.230
We're bumping fists…

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:50.400
But you can't read what's in my soul, Bro?

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.440
Doesn't seem like there's any good prospects this time…

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.320
Listen up!

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.230
Only one of you is worthy enough inherit the title of "Bee."

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.820
Ay here is a candidate to become the next Raikage!

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.400
You all know that… Here in the Hidden Cloud,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.650
each Raikage is assigned a tag team partner.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.320
Someone who will bring out the Raikage's full power.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.320
And to be "Bee" is to be the bodyguard of the Raikage.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.480
We'll now test your compatibility with Ay.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.400
You will team up with Ay and attempt to behead

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.650
this rubber dummy using the Double Lariat!

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.980
Remember! To do this right,

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.610
equal strength must be applied from both sides!

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.070
If one side is weaker or stronger, it will only bend!

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.070
First, bump fists with Ay and

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.400
determine how much power you should use.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.400
Then execute the Double Lariat on the dummy!

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.400
All right! We'll start from that end!

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.530
I'm honored, sir!

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.610
Next!
Yes sir!

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.030
Next.
Yes sir…

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:25.860
Next!
Right!

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.730
Next… Yes sir!

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.820
Next… – Yes sir! – Looks like we won't find

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.530
– anyone this time either.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.280
If he'd had a real sibling,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.650
we wouldn't have had to go through all this…

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.730
Next…

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.900
L-Lord Raikage…

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.320
It seems we found him.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.780
You're kind of an odd one. Bump fists with me again!

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.820
We are brothers from this day on!

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.900
I'm counting on you, Bee!

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.030
Let's go, Bee!

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.530
Your plan suits me just fine. We'll bump our fists every time.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.110
Okay, Bro!

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.360
Eat up!

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.690
You have to get strong quickly or our powers won't be in synch!

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.530
Okay, Bro!

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.230
Our mission this time is to recover a scroll.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.730
Don't tell me you already… Okay? Bro?

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.610
Is he asleep?

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.570
Yeah…

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.110
Bee is a good shinobi. He's got talent too.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.150
Although his rapping leaves much to be desired…

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.480
I agree.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.400
Probably after me,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.530
this boy will become the Jinchuriki of the Eight Tails.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.530
Is that what you've heard from the elders?

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.530
No… No one's told me anything yet.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.780
My old man, my uncle… They all failed.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.820
I'm not compatible either.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.400
Listen, as your cousin…

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.900
But look, you have the Eight Tails under control…

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.730
– Right now… – Just listen!

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.400
Only those who are Jinchuriki can understand.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.900
Friends and acquaintances start to look at you differently after.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.280
Well, they probably think they're treating you the same,

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.440
but you begin to see that they're not.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.730
There's no turning back.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.690
You can only look toward the future…

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.360
One that is filled with darkness and loneliness.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.730
Have you really achieved compatibility…?

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.780
If you walk through life

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.150
with the shadow of your own death beside you?

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.400
It fills your mind day in and day out…

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.780
and you begin to lose sight of who you are.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.860
You feel a hole in your heart.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.440
And the Tailed Beast waits to

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.570
pounce on that weak heart and run wild.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.650
When you live with the constant fear of death,

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.230
you start wanting to die.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.400
But you have a knack for ninjutsu,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.400
you have the skill and the ancestry…

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.440
You have everything going for you!

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.400
Yeah… That's exactly the reasoning they used

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.190
when they chose me as the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki. But…

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.730
that's not what's essential to become a Jinchuriki.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.070
So what is it?

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.440
Having something that can fill the void in your heart!

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.360
What is this "something"?

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.150
Just "something"!

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.400
If I can find it, I feel I can stay strong.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.230
Let Bee find that something.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.780
Another failure.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.980
This time, eight people were victims of his rampage.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.030
Because of the number of tails,

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.230
the Eight Tails is that much harder to control than the Two Tails.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.900
How long is this going to continue?

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.610
The next Jinchuriki is supposed to be…

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.400
you know, that boy.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.190
Such prestige, so immense…

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.690
The Eight Tails' name gave you presence…

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.610
Now I offer you incense… Whee!

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.150
I don't think he'll make it…

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.610
Th-This kid… How could he do this to our comrades?!

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.780
Treating us with such contempt!

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:57.780
Let's go, Bee!

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.440
Okay, Bro!

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.610
Bee?! This brat?!

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.650
So this means you're the A/B Combo?

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.360
So you're familiar with our technique?

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.570
D-Double Lariat?!

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.480
Bee, we still have a long way to go

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.360
before the Double Lariat is ideal.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.820
Right now, I'm toning down my power to match yours.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.190
You have to become stronger!

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.440
I-I know! Fool, ya fool!

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.980
How dare you address your older brother as "fool, ya fool"?!

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.440
It's the Iron Claw for you!

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.110
I'll surpass you someday, you'll see.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.570
On that day, I'll be carefree.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.440
The trick to this technique is keeping both our powers equal.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.780
So you have to come up to par!

00:15:55.610 --> 00:16:01.690
That sounds ideal to me. Talking down to you is my fantasy.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.530
You can fantasize after you master the Lariat!

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.360
Tonight…we will seal the Eight Tails in Bee.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.440
Right…

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.110
Having something that can fill the void in your heart!

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.900
If I can find it, I feel I can stay strong.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.730
Let Bee find that something.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.360
What is it, Bro?

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.280
You will now become a Jinchuriki.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.360
Things won't be the same anymore.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.400
It will be extremely tough.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.570
No kidding? It's always been like that.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.110
I'll just give the octopus a nickname as I rap.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.070
Listen up, Bee…

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.650
Always tell me everything, got it?

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.940
You are special to me!

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.570
We are the ultimate tag team.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.150
Even if he does have the Steel Shell Seal,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.150
I wouldn't be surprised if the Eight Tails starts acting up.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.480
We'd better stay on it and watch him.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.530
Wheee!

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.610
The Eight Tails is me, the cool Killer Bee!

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.530
Yay!

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.860
The blonde hair and the Teleportation Jutsu!

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.230
That's definitely the Yellow Flash, right?!

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.480
Then we've gotta get out of here!

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.690
So he's the one who singlehandedly prevented

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.900
the recovery of the Nine Tails!

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.400
And you are Unruly Ay,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.570
son of the Hidden Cloud's Third Raikage.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.440
Rumors say that you are extremely fast yourself.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.530
With Brother and me, we're gonna get you, fool ya fool!

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.690
Everyone, stay out of this.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.190
I will take care of this!

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.480
He countered me at my top speed?

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.440
What's this?

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:48.230
Forgive me, Bee.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:49.530
Are you all right?!

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.900
No way… Is he… the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki?!

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:57.860
It's the signal to evacuate!

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:58.530
Minato!

00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.980
We'll retreat for now!

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.610
This is child's play!

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.150
Eight Tails is the cool Killer Bee… That's me!

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.400
You have amazing prowess.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.860
Not as the Jinchuriki of the Eight Tails…

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.980
But as a shinobi, it seems you possess something very powerful.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.530
He's got more natural talent than me!

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.900
No, I don't mean that.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.900
He possesses something more precious.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:25.980
Huh?!

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.820
Ay… You have a fine family.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.440
As do I.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.150
In any case, the next time we meet…

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.730
I suspect we'll be fighting as one Kage against another.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.780
If you don't figure out

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.570
what your little brother considers most precious to him…

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.900
he will be neither a Jinchuriki nor a human.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.780
Don't try to fool me with that nonsense!

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.190
You are not getting away!

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.940
The Teleportation Jutsu goes where the kunai are…

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.530
I've noted the location of most of the kunai marked

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.030
with the jutsu formula.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.150
If I can figure out which one he'll pop up at,

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.940
I can get him using my top speed.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.440
I've got my own responsibilities…

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.480
Go fly!

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.030
Now! Which kunai will it be?

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.440
So I won't fail.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.610
On the Eight Tails' tentacles…

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.320
There's a Teleportation Jutsu Formula!

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.780
Was that when…?

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.570
Fine, let's do it, one on one.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.570
We'll stab at each other and get it done!

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.730
You are my foe… but I like you.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.530
You definitely got the moves of a shinobi killer…

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.530
Even if you kill Naruto to buy us some time

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.280
until Nine Tails comes back to life,

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.110
I can't see the next Jinchuriki managing to control

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.150
Nine Tail's power to this degree!

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.280
Since we have no idea which way this war will go,

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.570
I say we use all the weapons we've got,

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:53.570
and not keep the Jinchuriki in hiding!

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.650
I will let Naruto pass!

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.570
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Two Suns"

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.280
Now you're talking! That's the Granny Hokage I know! TWO SUNS

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.230
TWO SUNS Tune in again!
