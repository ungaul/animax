WEBVTT

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.000
Three of them? What's going on?

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.300
How could there be three Rinnegans...?

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.300
It must be his jutsu... There's some trick to it.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.430
Just when I was busy preparing dinner...

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.130
Ma, never mind that. Just focus on the opponent before us!

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.100
What did you say?!

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.670
I guess it's about time I made my move!

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.770
From this moment on, let Sage Jutsu prevail!

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.970
Look above, upon the halos and heavenly canopies!

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.900
Jiraiya the gallant--

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.570
- Quit yakking in my ears! - Quit yakking in my ears!

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.230
Ugh! Uh...

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.930
My posturing keeps getting interrupted today...

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.800
Let's end this quickly and go home!

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.070
I have to get dinner ready!

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.600
Ma, that guy's eye is more important than dinner!

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.400
Stay alert! It's the ultimate ocular jutsu!

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.700
Like I care!

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.670
Don't you dare belittle a housewife's dilemma

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.070
of what to cook every day, you old geezer!

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.370
How dare you use such a tone against me!

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.800
I was just looking after you!

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.930
Don't give me that!

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.470
Who are the ones yakking into whose ears again?

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.230
Not bad...

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.070
Now then... Can we put your spousal differences aside

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.100
and get this here over with?

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.370
Humph... Guess I'll just fry up something.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.470
Boy, you provide the oil. Pa, you bring the Wind Style!

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.430
Yes ma'am!

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.970
Sage Art: Bath of Boiling Oil!

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.670
Did it work?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.330
The oil vanished?

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.600
They ought to have been basted by it.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.130
That one probably has tricks up his sleeve too.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.500
Shall we find out with close combat?

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.400
Yes.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.900
Massive Rasengan!

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.000
He's...! He can absorb an entire jutsu?!

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.430
So that's what he did earlier... Behind us!

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.230
We got his back!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.200
What?!

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.370
He blocked my Sage Mode attack without looking?!

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.870
Sage Art: Kebari Senbon!

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.430
Not a single wasted movement.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.770
I would've gotten him if he'd dodged it...

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.300
Instead he blocked it by summoning without ever turning around.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.770
What's going on?

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.830
Blocking my attacks not just once, but twice!

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.100
With no verbal signals or eye contact between them at all...

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.400
Even if all three were sensory types,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.430
they still have to see an attack coming in order to counter it.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.930
Kebari Senbon is my fastest jutsu with the widest attack range.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.400
The only way to defend oneself against it is with a shield,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.570
as he just did.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.330
And he did it without looking.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.930
They're no ordinary clones.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.600
You said they have a trick up their sleeves, and you're right.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.370
Hmm?

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.100
Have you noticed?

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.400
What is it?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.470
When we got their back earlier,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.530
you picked the target and attacked from his blind spot, correct?

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.430
During that time,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.730
one of the other guys was watching us the whole time.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.030
I noticed that too.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.070
But there were no signs that

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.770
they were signaling each other either verbally or with eye contact.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.670
That's it! It's their eyes... All three have the same eyes!

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.430
Suppose the three of them can share what they see with each other...

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.630
Enabling their eyes to share images with one another...

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.070
Is that it?

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.070
Yes. That's what I suspect...

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.000
Still... What in tarnation are they?

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.300
This is bad...

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.600
Under these circumstances where my ninjutsu are being nullified...

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.370
To face all three at once is a bit too much.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.770
At this rate, if I enter battle...

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.870
I'll be killed, even in Sage Mode.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.630
I never imagined they would be this strong...

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.200
Fall back for now, Jiraiya-boy.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.130
Yes sir.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.800
He's escaped into the pipes...

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.830
In Attendance, The Six Paths of Pain

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.000
Why are we running away?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.500
We must analyze the Six Paths and come up with a strategy.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.000
And we'll need some time for that.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.470
They may look different, but all possessed the same eye.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.730
In short, they all have the Rinnegan of Six Paths...

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.500
Even if one of them is Nagato,

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.330
I can't believe there would be so many Rinnegan users crawling around.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.030
So what in the world's going on?!

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.770
Which one is the real Pain?

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.430
Figuring out the main one isn't the problem.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.600
The real problem is the fact that

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.430
three of them possess the Rinnegan of Six Paths.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.400
Just who...and what is Pain?

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:52.870
We don't know that yet. But we can make a small deduction.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.170
Their vision is linked, and they share images.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.870
That's the ability those eyes hold.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.830
Which means what, then? And how is it an advantage?

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.170
Put simply...

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.770
In the same way that three security cameras

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.030
show different angles of the same image,

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.400
those three are able to see three views at one time.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.400
So if just one of them can see the target...

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.270
the other two can counter with the ideal attack,

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.000
with perfect timing without having to see their foe.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.570
In other words, their field of vision is three times better.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.230
And unlike the Byakugan,

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.900
they can always guard each other's blind spots

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.030
without weaving signs or manipulating chakra.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.030
No wonder their combination is invincible.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.530
Which means we have to split them up and fight each one separately.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.670
I'm positive I can win one-on-one...

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.700
Since they possess such eyes,

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:02.470
fighting as a team would have to be their basic mode of attack.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.430
Taijutsu isn't going to work...

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.930
and any ninjutsu will just be absorbed.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.530
If taijutsu and ninjutsu won't work, then it'll have to be genjutsu.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.530
Yes!

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.200
But I am a dud when it comes to genjutsu.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.730
Ah, but as I recall you two were...

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.200
Yes... If they're former students of yours, Jiraiya-boy,

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.870
they know that you don't use genjutsu.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.730
So that might give us an opening.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.570
No way! I'm not gonna do it!

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.400
Wh-What is it?!

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.370
World peace is hanging on this battle, Ma!

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.630
This is no time to be selfish!

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.030
I don't care about no old geezer's senile prophecies!

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.470
The Great Lord Elder told us to get along, remember?!

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.870
What is it that you object to so much?

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.600
I can't sing a duet with Pa at this plump ripe old age!

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.730
It's embarrassing!

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.030
Huh? A duet?!

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.000
Our most powerful genjutsu involves appealing

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.430
to the auditory senses of the victim through song.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.130
Auditory senses? I see. That's why we retreated.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.970
Correct...This genjutsu is powerful, but as soon as we make a sound,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.630
our whereabouts will be revealed, which is its weakness.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.230
Also, there's the harmony of the sounds...

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.030
In other words, the genjutsu is placed with a melody.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.330
It requires a little time before it takes effect.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.330
If they discover our whereabouts

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.400
before they are caught in the genjutsu and attack, we will surely lose.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.300
However, once they are caught in the genjutsu,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.300
our victory will be assured.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.970
What's wrong?

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.700
If both your lives are ever in danger,

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.170
I want you to free yourselves from my shoulders immediately.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.370
Huh? Absolutely not!

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.530
The fate of the ninja world depends on this battle!

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.200
I have a plan. Although it is a gamble as well...

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.270
Do tell.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.930
Please begin... - Right. - Right.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:00.970
What is that?

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.170
This is...the croaking of frogs...

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.400
Is this a genjutsu?!

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.330
It's coming from in there.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.100
A Shadow Clone!

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.100
Fire Style: Giant Flame Bombs!

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.630
So that's your move!

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.070
Good! My gamble's a success!

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.330
That big one went after the jutsu to absorb it!

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.530
The first fellow only used summoning...

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.670
While both times, it was the big fellow who absorbed my jutsu.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.670
Just as I suspected,

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.570
each of them possesses only a single type of ability!

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.530
Right now, the big fellow's eyes are focused on the jutsu.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.930
One, I blinded earlier...

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.800
So only one of them...

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.230
is looking at me!

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.130
This one too!

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.900
Gotcha!

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.470
I can't move.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.300
The dark swamp?!

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:49.770
Just a little more!

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.370
Now we're really one-on-one!

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.000
I'm not letting you summon!

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.100
You got us...

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.930
You are inside a genjutsu paralysis that binds your psyche.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.330
Now none of your bodies,

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.530
including your main body, will be able to move.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.800
Jiraiya Sensei...

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.370
I didn't expect a genjutsu like this from you.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.800
I thought I taught you...

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.930
Never let your guard down, no matter who your opponent is, Nagato...

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.630
You erred in your decision.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.430
I just want to protect those two.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.700
No matter what kind of pain I have to endure.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.600
I see.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.300
Rather than rule the world through pain...

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.830
I wish you had moved past the pain and

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.100
harnessed your power to bring about peace in a positive way.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.830
That disciple will become a ninja

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.330
who will bring about a great change to the ninja world.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.700
That is what I saw in my dream.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.500
Either great stability or great destruction.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.800
The likes of which this world has never seen before.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.600
One of those two.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.630
For just a little while... I believed you were the one.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.470
Farewell...

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.330
It's done...

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.570
Are you both all right?!

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.470
This genjutsu is hard on the throat.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:40.170
It's real hard keeping tempo with Pa... This jutsu ain't that easy at all!

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.400
Damages the throat! Stretches the lower jaw 'til it sags!

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.370
Creates wrinkles!

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.970
My profound apologies. Please take your rest now.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.600
For I've made my selection.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:06.100
Didn't you teach me to never let down your guard...Jiraiya Sensei?

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.670
Lad! Your left arm!

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.030
I'm aware of that...

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.030
What's going on?!

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.270
This one's got a different face than the other three...

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.670
He was probably summoned earlier.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.970
I see! Before they got caught in our genjutsu!

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.470
Now then.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.770
In attendance... The Six Paths of Pain.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.300
Six?! There are six of them?!

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:13.630
Hey, look close! The three we just did in are there too!

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.900
The newly summoned ones must have resurrected them

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.800
with some sort of jutsu!

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.870
There's even a jutsu that can revive as many as three of them

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.330
when they were undoubtedly dead?!

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.070
Are they really human?!

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.930
Pain... What are you?!

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:39.700
Pain...

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:46.070
That name is an alias that denotes all six of us.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.070
Why...

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.600
are there six Rinnegan bearers?

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.470
Y-You're...!

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:41.970
Never going back on your word and never giving up...

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.170
Naruto, if that is your ninja way,

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.500
then as your mentor, I have no business whining.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.470
For everyone knows

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.370
that a student inherits his ninja way from his teacher...!

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.000
Next time, on Naruto Shippuden: "The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant"

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.370
Tune in again next time, won't you?

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.830
It's Naruto Uzumaki's Swirling Radio! Today's guest is...

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.230
To all my female supporters throughout the nation, Jiraiya has arr--

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.370
And now, let's get right to our first letter...

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.300
Hey! Let me finish my intro!

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.630
From radio alias "Pervy Hedgehog."

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.470
"When will the next 'Make-Out Series' be published?"

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.300
W-Well, I have an outline completed...

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.170
Okay, next!

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.700
From radio alias, "Akemi from the Fun Fun Alley."

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.370
"When will you pay your tab?"

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.400
Hey brat! How could you read that on the air?!

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:40.570
Couldn't you have asked me backstage...?

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.470
And so, we have Akemi at the studio today!

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.130
What?! I-Is there somewhere I can hide?

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.270
Just kidding.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.030
Huh? I-I knew that.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.330
Well, come on. Let's move on with the show.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.830
Geez... And you were so cool in the main story.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:04.930
Minato... Did I raise your son the wrong way?

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.570
Tune in again!
