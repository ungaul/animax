WEBVTT

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.370
How's this?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.600
So can your borrowed Sharingan extinguish that?!

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.730
I will show you the difference

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.400
between the real thing and a fake!

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.170
Damn it!

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.230
My sight!

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.600
Sakura! Why are you here?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.370
Don't!

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.300
I won't let Kakashi Sensei bear the burden!

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.300
I'm different from you guys.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.330
I'm walking a road that's incompatible with the rest of you.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.000
The four of us worked together...

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.170
and it's true that there was a time

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.870
when I thought that was my road.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.130
The four of us have worked together,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.970
but in the end, I decided on revenge.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.300
That's been my reason for living.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.900
I can't be like you or Naruto.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.330
I'll do anything for you, Sasuke!

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.730
So...I'm begging you, please stay here!

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.130
I'll even help you with your revenge!

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.900
I'll make it happen somehow, I promise you!

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.370
So stay here with me!

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.800
If that doesn't work for you, then take me with you.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.770
You really are…annoying.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.800
Don't go!

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.930
If you go, I'll scream and…

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.530
Sakura…

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.830
Thank you.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.900
Sakura!

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.030
Stop, Sasuke!

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.670
Two Fates

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.300
Your timing is better than mine, Naruto.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.300
I never imagined you coming here. You're a lifesaver!

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.870
Th-Thank you, Naruto.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.770
Sasuke really tried to kill me.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.700
If Naruto hadn't come, I would be dead now.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.200
By Sasuke's own hand.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.630
Sasuke… Sakura is a fellow ninja from Team 7.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.470
"Was" a fellow ninja. I no longer belong.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.270
Now do you understand, Naruto, Sakura?

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.800
His intent to kill is real.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.170
Sasuke is no longer the same person as before.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.700
Sasuke…

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.370
What?

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.570
I heard the truth about Itachi from a guy named Tobi.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.670
The truth about Itachi?

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.100
I don't know for sure if what he said is really true or not.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.400
But it doesn't matter.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.300
What you've been doing is… understandable.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.770
Naruto… I told you before.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.330
You don't have parents or siblings, so you couldn't possibly understand me.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.270
So outsiders can keep their mouths shut!

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.900
Do you know what Naruto has gone through for you?

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.730
No matter what rumors we hear about you,

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.800
he never stops thinking of you as a friend.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.430
While everyone targeted you,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.370
Naruto alone tried to rescue you!

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.970
Even now…

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.200
Rescue me? From what?

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.500
Well, from…

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.630
From revenge.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.470
I swear I'll save you from the chaos of vengeance.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.430
There's no need for that.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.170
The stage has already been set for my vengeance to happen!

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.030
Just awhile ago,

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.670
I finally got to take revenge on one of Itachi's enemies.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.270
How many Uchiha did you kill to get that right arm?!

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.130
It was Itachi who enabled me to get it.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.070
You made him do it!

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.770
This is the Reverse Tetragram Sealing Jutsu.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.670
Sasuke! Get away from Danzo!

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.700
I killed a high-ranking elder of the Hidden Leaf.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.270
Someone named Danzo.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.570
Sasuke killed Danzo all by himself?

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.170
I've never felt like this before.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.870
I feel the tainted Uchiha name becoming cleansed.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.930
I feel the Uchiha getting free from this rotting ninja world.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.700
You guys couldn't begin to understand.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:04.700
And isn't what I'm doing exactly what you Leaf ninja wanted all along?

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.030
You've always snubbed and put down the Uchiha.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.330
So I'll help erase the Uchiha from your memories.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.130
I'm going to kill all of you,

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.400
and destroy the Hidden Leaf!

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.500
Severing all bonds to the Hidden Leaf

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.430
is the ultimate purification!

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.630
And that shall lead to the Uchiha's true restoration!

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.530
Sasuke…

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.400
Hatred. The history of repeated accumulating hatred.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.900
That is what created the Sasuke in front of us.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.930
Though they may not realize it,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.430
Naruto and Sakura are seeing with their own eyes

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.170
that Sasuke is a victim of the times we live in.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.600
And that is why…

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.530
This is my task.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.570
Naruto, Sakura. Get out of here.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.630
But Kakashi Sensei…

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.200
If you stay, you'll see things you do not want to see.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.730
Now go!

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.130
I…

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.330
Sakura, the poison-laced kunai Shizune taught you how to use

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.100
won't kill Sasuke.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.870
Orochimaru gave him resistance to poisons.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.130
What's more… You've come to terms with your feelings, right?

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.900
Sasuke… I healed you.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.270
But your body cannot… withstand another battle.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.170
Sasuke…

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.130
Don't move, Karin.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.600
A vital point… Right through the hostage!

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.930
That's what I wanted to see.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.330
Brother… One down.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:59.730
No… I don't care about Sasuke anymore.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.400
Kakashi Sensei, this "something" I don't want to see…

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.400
Are you going to kill Sasuke?

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.270
Go! Both of you!

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.430
Now's my chance! I'm not holding back!

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.030
Wait, Naruto!

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.970
Naruto!

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.200
There's a chance, Sasuke…

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.600
that our roles…

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.630
could have been reversed.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.030
Run…keep running… and cling to life.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.500
Then one day,

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.200
come before me with the same eye that I possess.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.570
– Chidori! – Rasengan!

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.630
Sasuke… You remember, right?

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.000
The entire village used to despise me.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.070
It's because I have the Nine-Tails inside me.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.770
At one time, I hated the village too.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.830
I even thought about revenge.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.970
I want you to wipe off every bit of that graffiti!

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.730
Look. It's that boy.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.030
Why is he allowed to remain in the village?

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.900
I wish the Third Hokage would reconsider.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.300
Shut up!

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.300
You brat! Go away!

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.300
What's the big idea?!

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.700
Here!

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.870
I'll give that to you if you just leave.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.970
Why? Why?!

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.830
Why does everyone, even my homeroom teacher…

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.670
Why do you all look at me like that?!

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.970
I'm not a nuisance and I'm not some kind of germ!

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:27.800
I'm… I'm Naruto Uzumaki!

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.670
One step in the wrong direction

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.730
and I might have conjured up some terrible plan just like you.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.430
I used to think I didn't have any bonds with anyone.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.500
That's until I met you and Iruka Sensei.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.100
Koji! Time to go home!

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.900
Daichi! Dinnertime!

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.170
Okay.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.800
Let's go home, everyone.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.330
Mom!

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.730
What are you doing?

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.900
I told you not to play with that boy.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.630
Come on, let's go!

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.370
Naruto… I'll tell you the truth.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.970
You know about the incident 12 years ago

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.430
when the fox spirit was sealed, right?

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.700
Since then, there's been a certain law in the village.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.770
A certain law?

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.730
Well…

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.970
It's a law that you were never supposed to know about.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.730
Only me? Why is there such a law?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.870
It's a law that forbids anyone from saying

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.370
that your true form is the fox spirit.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.670
Namely, you are the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.700
that killed Iruka's parents and destroyed the village.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:54.200
Ever since our beloved Fourth Hokage sealed the Nine-Tails,

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.470
the entire village has deceived you!

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.600
No one will ever accept you!

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.400
Die, Naruto!

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.070
Naruto, get down!

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.630
But…

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.970
I understand, Naruto.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.530
You must have been so lonely, huh?

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.370
You must have suffered so much.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.170
Forgive me, Naruto.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.870
If I had been more reliable,

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.830
you wouldn't have had to endure this.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.670
I almost gave in to despair.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.300
But you and Iruka Sensei saved me.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.130
I knew that you were always alone.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:08.570
Watching you, I felt reassured that I wasn't the only one.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.330
We were both kids, and looking back…

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.430
I had to live with the Nine-Tails and you, the fate of the Uchiha.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.530
It's ironic that we had similar burdens.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.970
To be honest, every time I saw you,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.030
I wanted to walk over and start talking.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.270
I'd get sort of giddy.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.300
Because I felt like you understood me.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.630
But I stopped.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.130
The reason is because

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.900
I was jealous because you were good at everything.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.870
So I made you my rival.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:02.200
From then on, you've been my goal.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.670
Hey Sasuke, do you remember

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.700
what you said to me long ago in the Final Valley?

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.600
The thing about when two shinobi are of a high enough level…

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.530
I just learned a lot about you by trading blows with you.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:56.100
Can you tell what I'm thinking? Can you read my thoughts?

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:01.030
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "High-Level Shinobi"

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:03.870
Why are you so fixated on me?

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.130
Tune in again!
