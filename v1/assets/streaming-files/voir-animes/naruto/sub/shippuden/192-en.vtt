WEBVTT

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.070
They've been making us walk quite a distance since sunrise.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.610
Our battle must be imminent.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.900
Who will we be fighting?

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.690
You don't think it's…

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.690
Are they close?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.400
It feels familiar, nostalgic…

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.280
Itachi Uchiha…and Nagato!

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.940
You know these guys, Naruto?

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.940
Yeah, I know both of them.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.900
I never imagined I'd be forced into fighting you again, Naruto.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.480
It's probably been a while since we last met.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.360
But since I've been dead, it feels like it's only been a moment.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.480
You've changed a bit, Naruto.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.320
Oh, you mean this?

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.070
I'm in control of the Nine Tails' chakra now.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.860
This is my Chakra Mode!

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.400
What?

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.530
I see… No wonder you look different.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.400
It's your face.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.110
You now command the Power of the Nine Tails?

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.570
I'm impressed with your development!

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.480
He and I are sibling students.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.280
I'm not surprised!

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.190
For that, it's me he owes…

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.820
Before I came along, he was pretty much in the shadows.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.690
That's so not true!

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.070
So you've overcome hatred, Naruto?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.070
Oh yeah! As my senior, you taught me about pain.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.440
The training I did at the Waterfall of Truth with Octopops…

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.780
My mom and dad…

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.690
I have all of you to thank for where I am now!

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.860
I see…

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.940
Naruto, I must ask you…

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.400
That reminds me—

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.440
I have a question for you, as well.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.570
Seems like I found you first… Eight Tails and Nine Tails.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.400
With these two cards, he'll fall right into my hands.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.110
Too bad I won't be able to see the frustrated look on

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.150
his face under that mask… when he realizes!

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.030
Fire Style!

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.320
Fireball Jutsu!

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.820
Contact! Naruto vs. Itachi!

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.940
Naruto, I must ask you…

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.440
That reminds me—

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.570
I have a question for you, as well.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.730
Yo?!

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.940
Oops, was that hot?

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.440
Sorry for not giving it all I got.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.030
Samehada…

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.570
So Kisame is…

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.440
He was still talking…

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.360
He's under a spell…

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.820
Even if he cuts you off, what the hell?

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.230
Okay?

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.610
Above you!

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.650
I see him!

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.860
What happened to Sasuke?

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.530
He says he's going to take revenge on the Leaf Village!

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.440
He joined the Akatsuki!

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.530
Why won't Sasuke return to the village?

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.480
He found out about your top-secret mission,

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.400
and chose to destroy the village!

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.400
Top-secret mission?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.900
Don't tell me Madara…?

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.530
Madara told me the truth too.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.570
So that's how it was…

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.690
So Madara was telling the truth!

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.030
The Uchiha Clan tried to take over the village and…

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.190
You've said enough, Naruto.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.980
Is that true, Itachi?

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400
Itachi…

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.610
You died playing the villain

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.400
in order to protect the village and Sasuke!

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.940
Sasuke surely understands your pain and resolve!

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.320
But instead of seeing your wishes through,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.730
Sasuke is trying to destroy the village.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.570
This is his way of avenging

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.780
the pain the village caused his beloved older brother!

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.690
Damn Madara, he knew the truth about me…

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.570
Do the villagers know about this?

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.570
Kakashi Sensei and Captain Yamato were there too.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.480
But there was nothing to prove what Madara said,

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.480
so Kakashi Sensei is keeping everyone tight-lipped.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.780
I don't think anyone else knows.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.900
Then don't ever tell the village about this!

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.570
You can't let the Uchiha Clan's reputation change!

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.440
And one more thing…

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.530
Damn! My body is moving on its own!

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.570
Universal Pull!

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.320
Nicely dodged, Naruto!

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.610
I'm stronger now than when Pain and I fought.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.400
I'll let you deal with Sasuke.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.440
That was my plan from the start!

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.440
Entrusting it to you was the right thing to do, after all.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.480
Okay, Naruto, pull me away!

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.480
I can't move by myself.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.480
Summoning Jutsu!

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.110
What?!

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.110
Or maybe I can…

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.610
Did you always do that?

00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.650
Behind you!

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.480
I got it! Okay!

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.480
Fire Style! Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.440
Hot! Hot! Hot!

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.730
Caught you! Ya fool, ya fool!

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.940
For someone so big, that was easy!

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.280
Keep your guard up, Naruto!

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.440
What the hell's happening?!

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.940
Genjutsu!

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.570
Don't look at my eyes!

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:09.940
Ouch!

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.940
Wake up!

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.530
Samehada!

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.400
Killer Bee the Eight Tails! That's me!

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.780
Yay!

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.860
This'll go on forever!

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.820
He multiplies every time you hit him!

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.730
Knock me down first!

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.530
Watch yourself, Octopops!

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.730
If you get struck by Amaterasu or Tsukuyomi, it'll be the end of you!

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.610
He's got the Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.030
It's out.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.730
Did he do something to Naruto with his Visual Prowess?

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.570
Why did a crow come out of my mouth?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.230
Why are you so attached to my brother?

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.900
He's a Rogue Ninja.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.400
That's because unlike you…

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.230
I think of him as a brother, more than you ever did.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.400
You're already under my genjutsu.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.570
Damn it!

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.900
I'll say it again.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.440
I just wanted to talk to you for a moment.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.690
You've been trying to take Sasuke back to the village.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.440
But what if it doesn't go the way you want?

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.980
I'll do anything to make it happen.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.610
Even by force?

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.320
If, by some turn of luck,

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.980
Sasuke goes with you willingly, great.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.150
But what if the exact opposite happens?

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.530
What does that mean?

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.360
You just said you consider Sasuke to be like a brother…

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.530
What if Sasuke were to attack the Leaf Village?

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.230
What would you do then?

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.610
What? Why would Sasuke…?

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.110
There's no way he'd do something like that!

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.150
Sasuke is still naïve.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.650
He can easily be dyed any color.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.230
In such a case, can you stop him?

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.320
Even if you have to kill Sasuke?

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.980
Come to think of it, back then…

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.280
I have shared some of my power with you.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.400
Though I hope the day never comes when you'll have to use it.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.440
This feeling!

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.360
Naruto! It's Amaterasu!

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.480
Almighty Push!

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.820
Damn it! My body's moving by itself again!

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.650
What was that?!

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.530
What's going on?!

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.980
It's not Amaterasu?

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.610
So that's how it is…

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.030
How what is…?

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.230
Amaterasu…

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.940
He used Amaterasu?

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.360
That crow… It's yours, isn't it?

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.730
What did you do with that crow?

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.440
I underestimated him…

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.230
Itachi Uchiha. He's clearly different from the rest.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.570
He resisted my Reanimation Jutsu.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.400
It worked…

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.530
Oh, so that's it…

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.820
Amaterasu!

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.400
You!

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.610
Relax… I'm no longer being controlled.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.690
I used a new genjutsu against the enemy's jutsu.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.440
A genjutsu that orders me to protect the Leaf Village.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.530
It erased the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:25.440
I prepared that crow to respond to my Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.940
Just in case, for times like this.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.860
What're you talking about?

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.230
It's implanted in that crow's left eye.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.940
It's his eye!

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.570
There's only one genjutsu that can do that.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.150
Shisui Uchiha's…

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.110
The ultimate Mangekyo Sharingan genjutsu in existence:

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.530
Koto Amatsukami.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.320
Using that genjutsu, I was able to restore myself.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.570
It appears Shisui's Mangekyo had already worn off, though.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.980
Shisui Uchiha?

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.400
The Uchiha's most powerful genjutsu user….

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.610
Shisui the Teleporter?

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.610
Shisui's Visual Prowess creates a powerful genjutsu

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.570
that allows you to control someone without them ever realizing it.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:23.440
I programmed the genjutsu, to protect the Leaf, into Shisui's eye.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.940
Then I put it into the crow's left eye,

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.480
and after that, I gave the crow to you, Naruto.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.480
I never realized that I'd be using it on myself someday.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.610
Why did you have that eye, and why did you give it to me?

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.030
Self-sacrifice…

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.070
The mark of a true shinobi is that they do not seek glory.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.480
They protect from the shadows.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.530
Shisui taught me that.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.610
Shisui anticipated that a battle would ensue for his eyes.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.190
He faked his own death

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.360
and made it seem like his eyes were destroyed.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.110
I helped him by becoming the target of suspicion in the village.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.230
When I last saw Shisui,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.690
Danzo had managed to steal his right eye.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.190
He bequeathed his remaining left eye to me,

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.440
telling me to use it to protect the village, and disappeared.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:26.480
I gave that eye to you, because you share Shisui's feelings.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.150
If Sasuke, whom I left behind,

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.400
ever became a threat to the village…

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.440
then I would have violated all that Shisui entrusted me to do.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.440
You are the only one who can make it right.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.820
You said you consider Sasuke a brother.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.150
That's why I felt that you, Naruto,

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.400
were the only one who could stop him.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.530
True power… In his quest for the Eternal Mangekyo,

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.400
Sasuke planned on transplanting my eyes into himself.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.280
If that ever happened,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.230
that crow was supposed to emerge from you,

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.360
in response to your coming into contact with my transplanted eyes,

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.530
and cast the Koto Amatsukami to protect the Leaf, onto Sasuke.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.360
That was my plan.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.650
Why didn't you cast that jutsu on Sasuke from the start,

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.400
using Shisui's eye?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.190
It's not that I didn't, I couldn't.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.980
Not at that time…

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.980
Shisui's Mangekyo would take decades to reactivate,

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.030
unless you had Hashirama Senju's chakra.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.110
Also, there were many things

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.480
Sasuke wanted to use my death for.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.650
Itachi…

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.820
Thank you for trusting me.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.900
You don't have to worry anymore.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.530
You've done more than enough for the village.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.730
Let me take care of the rest.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.980
I would defend the Leaf Village!

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.400
But I would also stop Sasuke without killing him!

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:17.150
My little brother is lucky… to have a friend like you.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.610
Even Shisui's eye… Luck just keeps coming my way!

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.440
Almighty Push!

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:50.690
Where did he go?!

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.650
Almighty Push!

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.860
It isn't going to be that easy. Fool, ya fool!

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.360
Lariat!

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.480
Gakido!

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.070
Are you absorbing chakra?

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.030
Octopops, you okay?

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.110
Ningendo!

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.440
What…

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.070
…is this?!

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.820
Planetary Devastation! He got me with this jutsu once!

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.780
It's super bad ya' know!

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.230
If you get caught in it, it's over!

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.360
Hey, Naruto, if it's a sure death, how come you're still alive?

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.360
In that case, we'll be all right! We'll get through this fight!

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.480
Hey! This is no time to be laughing!

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.780
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Acknowledged One"

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.900
THE ACKNOWLEDGED ONE Every jutsu has a weakness!

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.020
THE ACKNOWLEDGED ONE

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.360
Tune in again!
