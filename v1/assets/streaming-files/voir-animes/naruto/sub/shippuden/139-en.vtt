WEBVTT

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.370
When we enter the Land of Iron, please find Naruto, Kiba.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.800
I know!

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.670
What's wrong?

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.600
All Ino could do was cry.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.670
But look at Sakura's determination.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.930
I don't know what she'll say to Naruto,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.070
but it's gonna get really uncomfortable.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.900
I'm sure Sakura's got some ideas.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.430
Four-man squads are the standard,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.770
but any search mission usually includes me.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.230
Plus, I've got that secret request from Sai.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.330
I need to use my nose to see if the Foundation,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.500
the Anbu under Danzo, is following us.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.170
Talk about working us to the bone. Ain't that right, Akamaru?

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.170
Hey you! Look at what you’ve done!

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.030
That's why I hate ninja.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.430
I-I'm sorry. I'll make sure it's repaired.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.830
Sasuke has shouldered the entire burden

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.200
of the Uchiha’s hatred and intends to strike the world with that curse.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.530
It is the most powerful weapon.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.830
It’s his friend and source of power, this thing called hatred.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.300
And it is Sasuke’s Ninja Way!

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.400
Sasuke chose this himself.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.500
The only thing left to do is to ask him myself.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.900
It seems Shee was right. The Hokage did make an escape.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.800
Yes, because of Sasuke.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.770
Nothing planned by the Akatsuki is going to be good.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.430
Who knows what you're up to?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.770
Sasuke is…

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.930
Bring Sasuke back!

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.630
Then listen to my explanation.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.430
It will all depend on your answer.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.000
Calm down, Raikage.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.770
Let's hear him out, and take it from there.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.600
Revive Sasuke.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.770
So that's Madara's ability?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.930
The Transportation Technique.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.630
Where am I?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.870
Now then, are you all ready to listen?

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.570
Why are you trying to win Sasuke over?

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.300
A Sharingan capable of awakening the Susano'o is rare.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.900
I like to stock up on good eyes.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.100
By battling the Five Kage,

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.330
I wanted him to hone his ocular powers even more.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.100
I'm the one who sent Sasuke here.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.130
I was intending on weakening the Five Kage and taking you all hostage.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.070
It seems that is still not possible.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.800
Taking us hostage? For what purpose?!

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.200
To smoothly implement the aforementioned Project Tsuki no Me.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.000
It's quite shocking to learn that Madara Uchiha is still alive,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.770
but why would a man of your skill resort to such a roundabout method?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.100
Surely, you have the strength to bring any plan to fruition.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.600
The injuries I sustained during my battle

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.300
with the First Hokage Hashirama were too severe.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.800
I have no strength in me now.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.000
You could say I am merely a shell of my old self.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.830
Is this a plan to restore yourself?

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.670
You could say that. But that's not all.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.130
What are you scheming?!

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.730
Just what is this Project Tsuki no Me?!

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.670
I want to take my time talking to you. Let me sit down.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.600
We’re asking you what kind of plan it is!

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.170
All shall become one with me,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.970
and result in a complete possession form that unites all.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.000
Become one? Unite all?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.930
What do you mean?!

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.530
The Uchiha have an ancient stone tablet

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.130
that has been passed down through the generations.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.630
It still exists underground in the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.600
Upon it are written secrets,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.500
engraved by the Sage of the Six Paths himself.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.500
It cannot be read unless you possess ocular powers.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.700
With the Sharingan,

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.630
the Mangekyo Sharingan and Rinnegan, in that order,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.800
the contents become increasingly visible.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.730
Your story is unlikely. The Sage of the Six Paths doesn't…

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.670
It is the truth!

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.600
He did exist. And he left the stone tablet.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.700
Don't change the subject!

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.030
What does your plan have to do with the Sage of the Six Paths?!

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.230
Do you know why he became a legendary figure

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.270
and a godlike figure that is revered as a god of ninja?

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.500
There lies the link between my plan and this man.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.400
Madara Uchiha…

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.530
You possess the Mangekyo Sharingan and among the Akatsuki,

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.300
there was one who possessed the Rinnegan.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.670
You know everything, don't you?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.130
We're listening.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.930
He once saved the world from a certain monster.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.870
Monster?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.730
Gaara, you also had one part of that monster sealed inside you.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.800
That monster was the combination of every Tailed Beast in existence.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.270
Something that possessed the most powerful chakra.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.930
The Ten-Tails!

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.430
Declaration of War

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.900
That monster was the combination of every Tailed Beast in existence.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.900
Something that possessed the most powerful chakra.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.230
The Ten-Tails.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.430
Aren't there only nine Tailed Beasts?!

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.870
I just told you.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.770
It was the combination of all the Tailed Beasts.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.370
Shukaku, Gaara's Tailed Beast known as…

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:06.770
the One-Tail!

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.600
The fiery Monster Cat of the Hidden Cloud's Yugito Ni’i…

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:13.970
the Two-Tails!

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.170
The former Mizukage's…

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.400
Three-Tails!

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.600
Roshi of the Lava Style’s…

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.530
Four-Tails!

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.330
Han of the Hidden Stone’s… Five-Tails!

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.970
The Rogue Ninja Utakata’s…

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.030
Six-Tails!

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.230
Fuu of the Hidden Waterfalls’…

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.830
Seven-Tails!

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.500
Raikage's younger brother, Killer Bee’s…

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.100
Eight-Tails!

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.070
And the fox spirit of the Hidden Leaf…

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.200
the Nine-Tails!

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:07.870
The Ten-Tails' chakra was simply divided up into the nine Tailed Beasts,

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.230
by the Sage of the Six Paths.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.830
I don't like where this story is headed.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.900
Is that why the Akatsuki are gathering the Tailed Beasts?

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.130
The Sage of the Six Paths developed a certain ninjutsu

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.330
in order to protect the world from the Ten-Tails.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.670
Even today, that ninjutsu is still being secretly passed down.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.200
It is the Sealing Jutsu process for Jinchuriki.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.100
Yes, the Sage of the Six Paths was the Ten-Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.700
In order to suppress it, he sealed the Ten-Tails within his body.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.070
The Sage, who saved a world terrorized by the Ten-Tails,

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.630
became a savior and won praise as a god.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:54.100
But if the Sage died, the powerful and demonic chakra of the Ten-Tails

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.500
would once again be released unto the world.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.270
Fearing this, at the time of his death,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.930
the Sage of the Six Paths summoned every last ounce of his power

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.900
to partition the Ten-Tails' chakra into nine parts

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.870
and scattered them across the world.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.500
Then he sealed the Ten-Tails' body, now devoid of chakra,

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.370
and hurled it into the sky.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.330
And it became the moon.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.700
What a tall tale! As if a human could do such a thing.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.600
When he became the Jinchuriki of the Ten-Tails,

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.170
the Sage of the Six Paths went beyond the realm of humans.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.900
I understand now that you seek that inhuman power

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:38.500
by gathering the chakra of the nine, namely all, of the Tailed Beasts.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.030
But what will you do with all that power?

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.430
Revive the Ten-Tails.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.730
And I will become the Ten-Tail’s Jinchuriki.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.400
I will use its power to strengthen my ocular powers,

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.830
and activate a certain jutsu.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.400
A certain jutsu?! What is it?

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.500
What do you intend to do?

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.700
A Super Genjutsu, where I project my eyes off the moon.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.500
Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.830
I will cast a genjutsu on every human that walks the earth.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:18.030
And in that genjutsu, I will control all humans and unify the world.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.270
A world without hatred or war.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.030
Everything will become one with me, everything will be united.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.530
That is my Project Tsuki no Me.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.200
Stop joking around! I’m not handing the world over to you!

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.030
Peace that exists only as an illusion is deception.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.000
Peace is only meaningful when it is genuinely achieved in the real world.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.000
So what exists inside such a world?

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.000
There is no hope, no dreams! It’s just an escape!

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.870
Unite the world, huh?

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.730
Danzo mentioned something similar.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.300
But instead of uniting the world,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.630
it just sounds like you want to make the world yours!

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.470
All this talk and yet, what have you Five Kage accomplished?

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.100
You of all people should know by now…

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.400
There is no such thing as hope!

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.770
To hope is equivalent to giving up,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.430
and it’s the biggest deception of all.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.500
Turn over the remaining Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails,

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.000
and cooperate with my plan.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.170
Or there will be war.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.300
War you say?

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.970
The Eight-Tails? What are you talking about?

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.070
Didn't you get Bee?

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.800
The attempt to capture the Eight-Tails failed and he escaped.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.300
He is a ninja who is a perfect Jinchuriki.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.730
Only your younger brother has got what it takes.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:46.770
Huh?!

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.570
Yeah, I sort of had a feeling about that.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.470
That idiot!

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.070
He used that chance to slip away and now, he's having the time of his life!

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.870
Unforgivable! He's going to get my Iron Claw!

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.770
We will not hand over Naruto Uzumaki.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.300
I agree with him!

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.670
What about you, Raikage?

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.830
There's no way I'll let him have my younger brother!

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.630
I don't have the strength,

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.500
but the Tailed Beasts we've gathered so far, do.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.700
You people have no chance of winning.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.700
We haven't given up hope.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.600
Very well.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.670
I hereby declare the start of the Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.570
The Fourth Great Ninja War?

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.630
Are you mad?!

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.900
The next time we meet will be on the battlefield.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.100
Well then, what do we do now?

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.970
We have to form an Allied Shinobi Force.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.130
It’s the only way we can counter the power of the seven Tailed Beasts.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.200
You were opposed to this, weren't you, Lord Raikage?

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.930
It seems my younger brother is alive.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.870
We cannot allow ourselves to be manipulated by the Akatsuki any longer.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.030
Form the alliance and settle this once and for all!

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.000
What about the Hidden Leaf? The Hokage ran off.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.500
There is too much suspicion surrounding Danzo.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.070
He lost our trust at this summit.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.170
When the Hidden Leaf ninja learn about him,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.700
his position in the village will become insecure.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.770
He will be removed in no time!

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.130
I will speak to someone I trust among the Hidden Leaf

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.930
regarding the Allied Shinobi Force.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.200
Who would that be?

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.570
Kakashi Hatake of the Sharingan.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.500
You mean the White Fang’s son?

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.370
Right here and now, this young ninja, no matter how awkwardly,

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.900
is bowing his head in his affection

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.000
for the Cloud and Leaf, village and nation.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.600
Lord Raikage…

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:05.000
As one of the five Kage, what do you think of this?

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.700
Fine. He seems more trustworthy than Danzo.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.970
Agreed.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.770
Lord Raikage, we must take measures to find Killer Bee immediately!

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.870
If the Akatsuki want the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.800
they are probably still pursuing Bee.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.770
Yes. Shee, send word to the village to put together

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.670
a Tracking Unit to begin the search for Bee immediately!

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.100
Yes sir!

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.600
We must notify Samui's team too.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.530
Omoi and Karui have been feeling quite distraught.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.030
If we are to stop Madara's Project Tsuki no Me,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.000
we cannot let the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails fall into his hands.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:49.900
I think it is imperative that our Allied Shinobi Forces find the two first

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.800
and place them into hiding.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.670
Y-You're absolutely right!

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.370
If the day comes when this Ten-Tails is revived…

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.100
However, we cannot even imagine the power Madara wields

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.400
with the seven Tailed Beasts he already has.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.330
Furthermore, he may possess certain jutsu or a trump card

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:07.770
for using the Tailed Beasts.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.530
Otherwise, he wouldn't have come on so strong.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.970
Perhaps it would be wise for the Allied Shinobi Forces to plan

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.930
on using the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails as military weapons too.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.300
That cannot happen.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.800
This is also a war to protect those two.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.530
There is a reason why Madara is waging war

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.770
with just the seven Tailed Beasts he has collected thus far.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.600
It is too difficult for Madara, in his weakened state,

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:38.130
and the Akatsuki members to capture the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.830
And even if they had succeeded, he felt the risk was too great.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.800
That is why he may be hoping to lure the two to his side through war.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.570
In any case, using the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails for battle

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.470
is not a wise strategy.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.870
I agree.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.000
I also concur with the Kazekage.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.170
If we consider the worst-case scenario,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.600
it will be like offering the Eight-Tails or Nine-Tails on a silver platter!

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.370
And besides, the Eight-Tails is my younger brother and

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.130
"military strategy" is a foreign concept to him.

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.630
I can’t predict what he’d do.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.830
Yay!

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.300
He may just create more chaos on the battlefield!

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.970
Naruto the Nine-Tails, would do the same.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.770
– That's for sure. – I'll say.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.630
I understand. Well then, Lord Tsuchikage,

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.870
our aim will be to protect and confine the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:33.670
Fine.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.170
Intel about Killer Bee will be provided to

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.330
the Stone, Mist, Sand and Leaf Villages.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.500
Use it to form Tracking Units and get moving!

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.300
Send word the instant you find the Eight-Tails.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.970
My younger brother will only heed orders from me!

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.500
By the way, Kazekage, we will leave the matter with Kakashi to you.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:53.630
Yes.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.670
On my way here,

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.830
I met Kakashi Hatake and the boy who is the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.900
They might still be here in the Land of Iron.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.300
You should start your search for them here.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.870
Understood.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.700
U-Um… May I say something?

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:11.800
What is it?

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.470
Uh… Yes… Umm…

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.370
Spit it out!

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.900
I-In the Akatsuki, there's someone who, like me, is a member of

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.000
the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist. Kisame Hoshigaki.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.000
He has chakra equal to that of a Jinchuriki

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.370
as well as a sword known as Samehada, Shark Skin,

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.200
which is the most evil, even among the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.800
When his chakra and sword merge, even though he is human,

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.300
he releases power close to that of a Jinchuriki.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.530
He is like a Tailed Beast without the tail.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.930
That's what I've been told by my seniors.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.930
He is extraordinary and must not be underestimated.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.370
We already know that!

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.230
But are you all sure about this plan?

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.830
We do not know what kind of power

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.030
the seven Tailed Beasts possess under Madara.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.930
If we confine the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails,

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.830
and our Allied Shinobi Force is destroyed while protecting these Tailed Beasts,

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.530
our entire effort would have been meaningless.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.470
If that is the case, I think it is better to use the two right from the beginning

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.770
in a combined effort with the Allied Shinobi Forces.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.230
I wonder about that.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:23.030
At this moment, the world's first Allied Shinobi Force is being formed.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.330
Its power is also unknown.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.630
Madara will also be taking a great risk

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.130
in pitting the power of the seven Tailed Beasts against it.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:35.570
Otherwise, why would he have come to this summit to try to negotiate?

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.170
He must also be dealing with unfavorable conditions.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.930
Furthermore, we Samurai will also participate in this war!

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.570
Lord Tsuchikage… Do you still have doubts even now?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.630
Looks like the Raikage and Kazekage went upstairs.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.670
Sasuke and Karin must have gone ahead.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.670
We should go up too.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.600
But it's guarded.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.100
We'll be spotted right away.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.400
Well, I have a good way.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.470
What the hell was he?

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.330
So gross!

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.300
If we keep doing what we’ve always done,

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.130
we’ll never find Sasuke.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.900
I’ve got to use Sage Mode.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.770
But first, I need to be able to sustain it longer.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.800
Naruto, come inside soon.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.270
Finally found you!

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.070
Sakura…

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.030
Sai, Kiba, and even Bushy Brows?

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.370
Why did you all come here?

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.530
Naruto…

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.000
I need to talk to you.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.100
W-What is happening?! Sakura, is this the truth?

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.370
Sakura, you’re… Is this really how you feel?

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.670
Stop Yamato, let’s hear her out.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.930
Is this for real, Sakura?

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.330
Yes, I just finally realized my true feelings.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.000
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: “Sakura’s Feelings”

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.830
What’s going on?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.370
Tune in again!
