WEBVTT

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.600
It hurts, doesn't it?

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.300
Well?

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.830
The judgment has been handed down.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.370
Wh-What do you mean?

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.070
How about it?

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.330
Has this helped you understand the pain that other people feel,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.370
even a little bit?

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.070
Even my arm...

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.600
Has his Jutsu done something?

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.370
No, that can't be...

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.900
You have already fallen under my curse.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.200
The ceremony will now begin.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.630
Well, then...

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.570
Why not taste the ultimate pain with me?!

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.900
The Judgment

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.130
You have already fallen under my curse.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.700
The ceremony will now begin.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.800
Well, then! Why not taste the ultimate pain with me?!

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.500
Why is Captain Asuma burned?

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.000
Wasn't his opponent the one hit by the Fire Style Jutsu?!

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.700
He definitely was hit.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.870
But for some reason,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.170
Captain Asuma was also burned by the Jutsu!

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.870
This...could it be that...

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.800
This will net us 35 million in gold.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.970
All the preparations are now complete!

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.270
It's going to hurt like crazy, so get ready!

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.800
Take that!

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.800
It hurts, doesn't it?!

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.800
But this is nothing. I haven't got you in a vital spot yet!

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.500
Believe me, THAT pain is out of this world!

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.530
The pain another feels while dying penetrates into my own body!

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.100
I pass through the pain, transcend it, and turn it into pleasure!

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.670
Captain Asuma...

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.730
is holding his left leg.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.230
Something strange is going on.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.830
It's the same injured leg as

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.300
the opponent who stabbed himself with his own lance!

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.900
Wh-Why...

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.270
You have already fallen under my curse.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.930
So that's how it is!

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:46.970
But of course...

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.600
His body and mine are connected with some curse.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.170
In other words, the damage dealt to our bodies is also linked.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.000
Furthermore, he is immortal.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.670
Where would you like to hurt next?

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.130
Hmm? Here? Or here?

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.930
How about both legs at the same time?!

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.700
Or...

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.770
shall we end now?!

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.330
How about it?!

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.670
Shikamaru! You must not use a physical attack like Shadow Sewing!

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.800
Stop his movements with Shadow Strangle Jutsu! Hurry!

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.900
I'm already on it!

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.730
Better make it in time!

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.970
Please make it in time!

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.100
Die--!

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.870
Do you think I'd let that happen?!

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.170
You did it, Shikamaru!

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.800
This won't stop me for long!

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.330
Izumo, how many minutes have passed

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.870
since you requested backup?

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.200
About ten minutes.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.970
It'll be at least another 20 minutes before reinforcements arrive.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.300
That long?!

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.770
Damn...! What should we do?!

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.770
If we kill him, Captain Asuma will also die!

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.170
Usually, one must kill one's opponent in order to break a long-lasting type Jutsu.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.930
But if that is not possible...

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.830
Every Jutsu inevitably has rules associated with it,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.230
as well as risks and pitfalls.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.000
First, I need to calm down and analyze the opponent.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.830
I was saved, thanks to Shikamaru.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.930
I must take this chance and think of a way to break this Jutsu.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.300
With him as an opponent,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.700
the Shadow Strangle Jutsu won't hold out that long.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.700
There's little time to consider the next move.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.900
If this wears on any longer, I'll lend a hand.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.970
We can't let all the money get away.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.030
I told you to butt out, Kakuzu!

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.000
I can handle this...!

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.570
Truth be told, the situation as it is...

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.970
we're lucky the other guy has stayed out of the fight for now.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.030
Be that as it may, there's still the question of what to do.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.770
Well, it's all a matter of time now...

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.430
Why that...

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.130
That's it... Think back...

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.570
Surely, I've come this far assuming

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.630
I'd be fighting against an adversary beyond the scope of my imagination.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.200
OROCHIMARU The Akatsuki Organization is made up of ten members.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.370
But Orochimaru withdrew.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.670
SASORI Sasori of the Red Sand is dead.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.470
ITACHI Of the remaining ones, we know the identities of three.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.500
KISAME Kisame Hoshigaki,

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.500
who is reputed to have sparred with Guy Sensei with ease...

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.230
He might be a Water Style User.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.300
ITACHI Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha with his Sharingan...

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.130
It was his handiwork that put Kakashi in the hospital for over a week.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.330
Deidara, said to have sparred with Naruto.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.070
He uses animated explosive clay.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.430
DEIDARA He blew himself up in the end.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.430
It's doubtful whether that story is actually true.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.770
That leaves five members of the Akatsuki Organization...

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.400
Whichever of the faces in this file you pick,

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.430
you'll find him to be one tough opponent.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.070
Their Ninjutsu will be of a level that should not be underestimated.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.800
Though the true nature of these five is unknown,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.630
there is no doubt they have special abilities that are beyond our imagination.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.270
RECORD OF PAST BATTLES Good grief.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.370
We're up against the worst possible bunch of fellows.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.330
When it comes to this,

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.700
it's meaningless to formulate a strategy in advance.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.730
In fact, any preconceptions might make matters worse.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.670
So, what should we do?

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.030
It goes without saying that we should train to get stronger,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.730
but what happens when you encounter

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.600
 an adversary against whom you cannot win?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.970
The nature and extent of the enemy's powers--

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.470
his Ninjutsu, Taijutsu, and Genjutsu.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.400
You must discern what type of Ninja he is.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.130
Then you need to determine whether or not it's a combined attack

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.900
by guys who function as a two-man cell.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.570
And if there's a possibility of that,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.830
then what kind of chemistry does he have with his team members?

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.700
We need to gather as much information as possible

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.470
and make a split second decision.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.170
When you're up against an organization like the Akatsuki,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.730
there isn't even time to gather such information, is there?

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.570
Akatsuki, you say?

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.170
Asuma...

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.470
Have you already taken action against the Akatsuki Organization?

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.000
No, I came to the conclusion that it was pointless.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.500
That's what you think.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.370
If you got hold of even one piece of information about the enemy,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.670
it could lead to a successful strategy.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.030
If we could get our hands on such information.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.400
That's difficult since we're up against the Akatsuki for the first time.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.730
A guy like me would be blown away in an instant.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.930
Well, you're probably right about that.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.200
RECORD OF PAST BATTLES CLASSIFIED DATA VOL. 1 It's mortifying, but those are guys who don't slack off.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.270
That is if you were to come up against the Akatsuki on a one-to-one basis.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.930
You are one of the best at judging and analyzing a situation,

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.530
even among the Hidden Leaf.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.200
If you can't find the time to strategize in a one-on-one combat,

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.870
then depend upon your comrades.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Team responsibility is important,

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.900
but one who does not rely upon his comrades...

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.670
KISAME is not fulfilling that responsibility.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.600
There are times when even if you can't do it alone,

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.170
things will somehow work out

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.870
if you and your comrades pool each others strengths.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.670
It's not enough for things to just somehow work out.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.530
Then, do something.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.000
Before your comrades get done in.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.870
Asuma has left me with a wealth of information.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.330
Think! You've got to think!

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.700
Remarks, personality, speech patterns... the clothes they wear...

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.100
Grasp their movements right up to now.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.030
The significance of each and every action.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.270
And then the connection between actions.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.670
Develop a hypothesis about their abilities

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.100
that can be drawn from all these factors.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.700
It's all about observation and analysis.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.330
God's judgment will be handed down!

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.900
God...judgment...

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.570
You have already fallen under my curse.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.800
The ceremony will now begin.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.000
A curse...the ceremony...

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.530
With this, all preparations are complete!

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:54.600
Preparations...!

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.130
Looks like Shikamaru came up with an idea.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.970
Did you figure something out, Shikamaru?

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.070
Yeah!

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.730
It's amazing that you're capable of such an analysis

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.530
while still maintaining your Jutsu.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.470
Shikamaru is endowed with lightning powers of analysis

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.430
that enable him to look ten steps ahead and predict 200 more.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.170
What's more, he has the intuition to choose

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.070
 the best possible strategy based on that analysis.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.270
I'm heading out, Captain Asuma...

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.730
That Shadow Jutsu...

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.600
Does it force the person it's used on to mirror the motions of its caster?

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.330
Why you... Trying to sniff out the true nature of my Jutsu.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.270
What are you going to do?!

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.400
I'll draw that creep outside the strange pattern drawn on the ground!

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.500
If I do that, his curse Jutsu will be broken.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.970
What on earth does that mean?!

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.030
His weapon... That huge scythe with three blades.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.830
Judging by its shape, I'd say it's not designed to land a single fatal blow,

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.170
but rather increase his attack range.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:45.830
All his weapons are designed to cause damage from a distance.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.170
In other words, his tactic is to only injure his opponent

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.100
and then buy time to deploy a lethal Jutsu.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.100
And by that you mean the curse?

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.770
But what's the connection between the enemy's wound and the curse?

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.470
It's blood...

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.600
In order to form a link between himself and his targeted opponent,

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.530
he needs to find a way to incorporate that opponent's blood into his own body.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.400
So when he was licking the blood...

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:27.000
Then if he wounds his opponent and even a little blood adheres to that sickle...

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.700
he can curse his opponent.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.330
But of course...

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.230
After licking the blood, his body changed color.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:39.800
That is a condition for invoking the curse. But that's not all.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.470
In order to completely invoke the curse, one more condition must be met.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.900
One more?

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.470
This brat knows his stuff.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.030
A little while ago,

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.200
that creep let Asuma's Fire Style Jutsu roll right off him.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.870
He was unfazed,

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.030
but he hurried back to that strange pattern drawn on the ground, remember?

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.500
And once he was standing inside that pattern,

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.070
he said the ceremony would begin.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.830
And by howling that the preparations were now complete...

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.930
We can surmise the set-up for his art of cursing

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.200
is only complete once he steps inside that pattern.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.500
You little brat!

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.830
You talk too much.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.500
He was able to figure all that out?

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.430
You little brat!

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.100
Why you! I'll get you later! I'll tear you limb from limb!

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.970
I'll pulverize you! I'll turn you inside out!

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.030
There isn't going to be a "later"!

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.570
We got him out!

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.900
All right! The curse is broken!

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.200
All right!

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.530
Wha--?!

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.330
Nuts...

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:03.870
I can't move...

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.700
I'm at my limit! I don't think I can hold him any longer.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.600
You did well, Shikamaru.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.900
Kakuzu! Lend me a hand!

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.200
Hey! Snap to it!

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.470
I told you to keep your wits about you.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.030
All right! So this leaves only one opponent remaining?

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.900
But his power and speed are probably greater than that of the immortal guy.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.370
And he may still have abilities we don't know about...!

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.100
Shikamaru!

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.470
Shikamaru is exhausted.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.430
And the captain is wounded.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.430
What do you want to do, Izumo?

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.270
We have the advantage of outnumbering our opponents

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.330
and even immobilized one of them.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.270
But perhaps we should start looking for a chance to retreat.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.530
Next time: "Unfulfilled Scream"
