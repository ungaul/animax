WEBVTT

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.530
All right.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.400
Starting now, our main mission is to find Itachi

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.430
and take him into custody.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.600
- Yeah! - Yes!

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.570
Akatsuki's goal is to round up the Tailed Beasts.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.100
It is believed that they already have the Three-Tails.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.930
According to the data obtained by Jiraiya,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.500
it's possible they have infiltrated the Land of Fire and will target Naruto.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.830
Itachi, in particular, is originally from the Leaf Village.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.330
Three years ago, he returned to the village

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.230
and attempted to take Naruto.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.500
So he's headed for the Leaf Village again?

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.200
As well as Sasuke who is after this Itachi Uchiha!

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.700
Alright!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.830
I'm gonna meet up with Sasuke no matter what.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.730
Well, let's just take it one step at a time.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.830
Here's the search plan.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.270
Using this as the central point,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.470
we'll search all four directions for five kilometers.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.770
If we find nothing,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.800
then we'll move the central point and spread out five kilometers from there.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.900
And...we'll keep repeating this strategy.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.900
Five kilometers... Our wireless radio will be out of range!

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.530
And if we're separated, it'll be dangerous!

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.000
The rules state that all patrols must be done by two-man cells.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.970
- If we encounter the enemy--! - Sakura...

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.230
Don't get so worried.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.430
Just watch...

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.770
Our voices which travel even farther than the wireless radios,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.400
and our noses that can instantly sniff out danger, will protect you.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.630
Pakkun!

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.600
All right, let me explain the patrol team formation.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.900
This time, two ninja hounds will be assigned to each member.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.530
Two dogs...? Huh? But...

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.800
Get along, all of you.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.800
Hello, Sakura.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.970
You're such a snappy female as usual.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.270
I'm partnering with Shino.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.000
Ugh... You stink of insects.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.070
You stink like a dog.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.800
Hello.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.530
Let's work together... In peace and harmony... Hehehe!

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.230
I wonder if... I can become friends with dogs?

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.170
What about me?

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.830
Naruto, you're the Jinchuriki they're targeting.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.570
Just in case you're attacked,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.600
you'll be with Yamato and Sensory-Scout Hinata.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.270
And Big Bark Bull.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.930
L-Let's work together, Naruto.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.170
Right!

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.300
And being ninja-hound users, Kiba and I will each have one dog.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.930
So we're all set!

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.730
Listen up, everyone.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.630
Above all, you will track Itachi and Sasuke's scents.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.670
If you find either one of them,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.970
verify their location, then return to this spot.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.100
Especially you, Naruto. Don't go running off ahead of us.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.270
I know.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.030
All right then, let's head out.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.400
Scatter!

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.300
The Hunt

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.830
I'm going.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.600
Itachi Uchiha, eh? I hope we can find him.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.930
All right!

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.070
Sa-su-ke!

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.230
I'm staying with you!

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.930
You too. Get going.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.770
Drat!

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.300
It's completely healed... Yeah.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.670
And? Which one are we going for?

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.100
Sasuke or the Nine-Tails...?

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.930
Well now, which will it be...?

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.300
W-W-Wait, D-Deidara Senpai!

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.500
Wait up!

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.500
PAWN SHOP

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.430
Who are you?!

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.500
I guess underlings don't matter.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.930
Go and check.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.030
Yes.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.830
Huh? Who are you?!

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.030
You're that Akatsuki... What's his name?

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.970
Kaku... Kakuta... Kakusa... Kakushi... K-Kakuzu...

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.800
Yes, that's the one.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.070
You're that Kakuzu's henchman- his bookkeeper, right?

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.630
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.700
J-Just please don't kill me...

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.070
That's the way... Keep talking.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.870
Let me ask you guys...

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.000
Akamaru! Don't lose to the other ninja hounds!

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.130
We'll be the first to detect Sasuke and Itachi's scents!

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.530
You're too slow, Shino!

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.270
Don't dawdle!

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.570
I don't like them...

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.070
Let's go! Pochi! Tama!

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400
Pochi...?

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.030
Tama?!

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.300
Don't give me silly nicknames!

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.600
Sasuke...

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.270
If you don't wipe that solemn look off your face,

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.230
you'll scare off the boys.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.470
What?

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.200
The more you chase, the further they run away.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.930
You're a female that keeps on pushing, aren't you?

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.100
Why don't you try pulling away for a change?

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.070
What a thing to say!

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.530
Sasuke and I...

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.730
aren't like that...

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.870
Hey, stop being so rude.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.800
Humph!

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.630
It's just that I want to let Sasuke know...

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.200
how I...how everyone feels.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.100
Everyone is waiting for Sasuke to return home.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.730
That's all...

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.070
Fine. Well, if pulling away doesn't work, why don't I try sniffing?

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.170
What's the matter?!

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.200
I caught a whiff of Sasuke Uchiha's scent...

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.670
What?!

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.530
Well?

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.730
The smell is faint, but it's steadily getting closer.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.430
What are you doing?! He'll be on to us before we find him!

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.430
We have to be cautious!

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.170
He's near.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.870
Sakura, do you see Sasuke around?

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.530
This isn't good. The smell is going farther away.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.570
I've given it a once-over, but I don't sense any chakra.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.970
Maybe I'll go back to Sasuke.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.700
The other two are probably not back yet.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.730
I found it, Tobi!

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.600
Yeah!

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.830
No kidding?! That was fast!

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.930
And? Which one is it? The Nine-Tails or Sasuke?

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.330
What an opportunity. We're going together, Tobi.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.130
So... Which one?

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:00.630
Just follow me!

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.570
Yes.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.400
Naruto... Hinata... You understand, right?

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.630
Yes.
Yeah...

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.470
You're...!

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.100
Show yourself... Who are you?

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.600
You found me, after all...

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.300
Kabuto Yakushi...

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.730
You've got guts approaching us by yourself.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.300
I wanted to have a chat with Naruto.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.330
You're not getting away this time. We're taking you in.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.100
Hey! Kabuto! You would know! Where is Sasuke?!

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.870
Humph! Still can't get over Sasuke, eh...?

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.970
Is it true that Sasuke killed Orochimaru?!

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.530
Yeah... It's true.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:32.800
More importantly, I brought you a present today.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.130
That outfit... You're...

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.970
So you're Sasuke... You really do look like Itachi!

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.170
S-Scary!

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:54.300
- Ha! - Ha!

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.830
What's that?

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:10.500
Information our organization has gathered regarding Akatsuki.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.200
What of it?

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.230
It's yours. You can have it.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.800
Now that Orochimaru is dead...

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.830
you're trying to negotiate with us?

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.770
Nope... I don't think it's as easy as negotiating with something like this...

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.230
Especially with the Leaf Village.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.570
Then why?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.570
Unlike Orochimaru, Akatsuki isn't after you.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.670
It's a simple gift to Naruto. A token of my gratitude.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.170
Plus, Akatsuki is pursuing you.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.770
Gratitude...?

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.500
After Lord Orochimaru died,

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.070
I lost sense of who I was.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.570
I never knew my parents or my homeland.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.930
The enemy found me and from the time I was little,

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.200
I moved around the lands and villages as a spy.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.470
Lands and villages didn't mean much to me.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.430
That is, until I began serving Lord Orochimaru...

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.870
But now, he's gone too.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:20.230
Just who am I? The agony of not having an identity...

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.170
You can understand, can't you, Naruto?

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.770
Like I'd understand anything you say!

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.030
Humph... I wonder about that.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.230
Are you Naruto Uzumaki? Or are you the Nine-Tails?

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.630
In the past, you were shunned... regarded with loathing.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.000
You must have questioned yourself about who you really are.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:46.300
However, you had faith in your strength

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.970
and told yourself that you were Naruto Uzumaki...

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.430
and you boldly overcame their views about the Nine-Tails.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.400
What does he intend... to do with Naruto?

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.370
I can't figure out his intentions...

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.630
And that's why you are sure of your identity

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.570
and you found friends who accept you.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:12.300
But instead of overcoming Lord Orochimaru,

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.130
I desperately clung to his power.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.770
I'm really able to understand how you feel now.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:25.070
You made me realize... that I want to be like you.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.730
So now...

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.900
I'm going to surpass Lord Orochimaru whom I absorbed,

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.330
and discover a new, stronger self.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.430
I'll find my new self...

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.970
and you have given me a hint to finding it.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.030
That's why I'm grateful...Naruto.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.270
Lord Orochimaru is the symbol of reincarnation.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.400
He continues to live on inside me, as an existence that I must overcome.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.370
Took...into your body?

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.630
Well...

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.730
It was just a small segment of Lord Orochimaru's corpse

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.230
after Sasuke killed him...

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.630
which I transplanted into my own body.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.270
But, his life-force is amazing.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.900
It's now steadily trying to take over my body...this thing.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.300
That's ridiculous...

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.230
What is that?

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.800
Byakugan!

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.200
One-third of his body has already been taken over.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.770
But I've been fiercely resisting this takeover!

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.230
I can feel this part of me that's trying to overcome Lord Orochimaru!

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:54.670
Is that all you want to say?

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.200
Well, give it everything you've got!

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.030
In a jail cell in Leaf Village!

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:11.500
Wood Style!

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.270
All right! Gotcha!

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.300
Behind you!

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.830
Dammit...

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:27.600
When I'm able to fully control Lord Orochimaru's power,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.570
I will fight you again, Naruto.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.500
But you come later.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.300
First, it'll be Sasuke who brought down Lord Orochimaru.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.570
What're you gonna do to Sasuke?!

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.100
Until we meet again.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.900
We did it! We brought down Sasuke.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.330
As expected, Senpai...

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.100
As expected, Senpai.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:20.770
Shut up!

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.330
But looks like he's kinda strong... this guy.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.630
Imagine Orochimaru being killed by a brat like him.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.730
I still can't believe it...

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.000
Huh?

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.900
Tobi, look how he's glaring at us! Humph!

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.500
You're raring to go, eh Senpai?

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.300
You'll have to apologize to Itachi later.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.600
You guys must be Akatsuki. Where's Itachi Uchiha?

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:41.330
Huh?

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.530
If you tell me nicely, I'll let you go.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.430
What shall we do, Senpai? He's playing hardball.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.330
Sharingan...eh? You're Itachi's kid brother, all right.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:54.530
So you were able to kill Orochimaru because of your Uchiha bloodline...

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.670
Lucky enough to be born into that family! That's all it was!

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.500
If you don't feel like telling me, that's fine.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.570
I'll just wring the information from you by force.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.870
Next time: "Clash!"

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.230
PAWN SHOP

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.130
Oh...

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.730
Once again, the due date for Lady Tsunade's debt is looming.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.700
Tonton! We have no choice.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.230
Let's go and do that thing like we used to!

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.130
Huh?

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.670
You'll catch a cold sleeping out here.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.800
Oww... Are you all right, Bro...?

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.970
Um...

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.500
I'd like to borrow some money.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.100
Bro! This one's a winner!

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.430
I know! I know!

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.330
If we sell her, I think we'll get over a million ryo!

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.030
All right! How's about 500,000 ryo?

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.700
Thank you very much!

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.630
I'm sorry!

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.870
PAWN SHOP Bro, the pig disappeared!

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.370
What?! What a day this is turning out to be!

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:10.070
Tune in again!
