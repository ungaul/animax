WEBVTT

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.600
I thought we dodged it...

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.030
No time to waste here!

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.100
I'll finish this with my new jutsu!

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.100
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.170
I see... So you have become a Sage...

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.700
mastering the same jutsu as Jiraiya Sensei.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.630
Jiraiya... "Sensei"?

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.130
I also learned jutsu from Jiraiya.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.930
He was once my master...

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.700
which would make us sibling disciples.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.000
Sharing the same master,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.100
you and I should be able to understand one another.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.070
Our master desired peace.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.030
Shut the hell up!

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.300
Such massive chakra... Did you teach him that, Pa?

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.400
No... I'm seeing it for the first time too.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.200
He never showed that during our training.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.530
What is Naruto-boy planning to do?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.700
What is that jutsu?

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.970
What is it?

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.230
Naruto's chakra is forming into... Yes, almost like a shuriken.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.370
Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken?!

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.470
Naruto!

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.970
All that...

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.030
you've done here...

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.470
Where's the "peace" in that?!

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.730
You're only looking at the tree, not the whole forest.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.630
You don't know the true meaning of peace.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.500
So let yourself be captured.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.730
Your death will lead to peace.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.900
I told you...to shut the hell up!

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.130
He threw it!

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.570
What?!

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.570
When did he learn to hurl chakra with such high rotation and density?!

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.300
This is the result of the other training I did!

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.900
It expanded!

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.970
Summoning Jutsu!

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.100
Deidara was right.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.800
He does not listen.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.870
What was that?

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.830
What's going on?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.670
Who's fighting them?!

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.100
It's Naruto.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.030
Naruto?!

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.870
Naruto is back?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.070
Yes.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.570
He has mastered Sage Jutsu and is now fighting Pain alone.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.830
What?!

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.430
Damn this leg!

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.470
Please stay here.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.170
Naruto has asked us not to interfere.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.770
He's so full of himself!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.900
Look what they did to this village!

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.130
There is no way he can take them on by himself... No.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.700
If he's mastered Sage Jutsu, he's in a class of his own now.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.470
Staying out of the way is the best teamwork we can offer for him.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.330
Sit tight, Shikamaru.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.070
Damn it!

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.010
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.100
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.520
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.440
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.240
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.540
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.750
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.380
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:53.010
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.010
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.180
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:08.400
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.900
Someday... koete

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.970
Danger! Sage Mode Limit Reached

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.030
Please be careful!

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.900
The more you strike, the more it will divide in numbers!

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.070
Why didn't you tell me sooner?!

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.170
You see... I'm ungraceful...

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.400
Oww!

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.870
So how do we handle this?!

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.530
We must ungracefully endure it for now...

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.830
Chief...

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.130
You're slowing down.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.770
It seems your Sage Jutsu power is decreasing.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.100
Did you use up your Sage Jutsu Chakra with that last jutsu?

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.800
Oh no... I'm about to lose Sage Mode!

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.770
I have to bring this guy down before Sage Mode runs out!

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.700
Ma, you know what to do!

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.970
We're going to break the Rinnegan link!

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.600
Got it, Pa!

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.670
Bunta-boy!

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.100
Boss!

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.170
Listen up.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.800
I'm going to hurl you straight at Naruto-boy!

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.230
Hurl...me? But why, Boss?

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.730
Listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.770
Ready, Pa?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.500
Sage Art!

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.800
Wind Style: Sand Dust!

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.330
Where is he?!

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.370
Rasengan Barrage!

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.330
Inside its mouth?!

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.970
You've exhausted your Sage Jutsu.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.300
Even in Sage Mode, two Rasen Shuriken are my limit.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.070
Pa! The boy's no longer in Sage Mode!

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.870
I know that!

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.430
It's risky, but we must merge with him now!

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.670
Except we can't...

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.570
Now is my chance.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.270
What?!

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.930
You mean we can't merge with him because of that Nine-Tails?!

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.900
It seems that way.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.330
Then what are we to do?!

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.070
Naruto-boy came up with his own unique solution.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.570
That's what he's about to do!

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.670
You little scamp!

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.470
Why you... Damn it!

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.770
Damn!

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.030
This way, Naruto-boy!

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.370
Hand it over! I'll do it!

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:05.900
Bring it on!

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.530
Stay back, kid! I'll get him!

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.000
I'm going to enter Sage Mode!

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.500
What?!

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.130
Get back, Chief!

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.730
I don't want you guys to get caught in my Rasen Shuriken!

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.870
Acting all tough now...

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.330
I can replenish Sage Chakra two more times.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.700
That means I have four more tries with my Rasen Shuriken!

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.900
I have to settle this within that time.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.570
Let's do it, Naruto-boy!

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.300
Reverse Summoning Jutsu!

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.270
It's been summoned!

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.100
Now release your jutsu!

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.470
What?

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.570
What's going on?

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.400
It's simple.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.400
Naruto-boy prepared his Shadow Clones beforehand,

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:04.330
and had them build up Sage Jutsu Chakra while standing by.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.730
Then he can summon them through the scroll anytime

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.430
from Mount Myoboku.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.470
Once summoned, he would undo the Shadow Clone

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.800
and the Sage Jutsu Chakra is restored to the original.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.770
I see. That is a way indeed!

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.070
All right! You're mine!

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.970
Wh-What is this?!

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:14.770
That's right.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.330
This is the one that absorbs ninjutsu.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.400
But I thought we already took care of him.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:35.570
What is that?

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.930
It seems that Pain is the key player.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.100
The one Geezer Sage spoke of...

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.670
The one who can resurrect the dead?

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.030
He must be the Pain who possesses that power.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.370
That is why when they lined up in formation...

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.600
that Pain stepped back to take the rearmost position of the troop.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.070
And the most troublesome Pain is the one on the left.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.770
He can repel all jutsu and attacks, and pull things toward him.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.970
He hasn't shown his powers yet, which is suspicious.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.800
Perhaps, for some reason,

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.800
he's not able to utilize his powers yet.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.600
Either way... We have to get rid of the guy in the back!

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.800
Along with some Smoke Bombs!

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:39.570
All right!

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.870
It's useless.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.230
What you absorbed was a Transformation Jutsu!

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.300
Bastard!

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.130
You're the original?!

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.700
You can't dodge this!

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:16.730
This time, I got you for sure!

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.900
My power has finally returned.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.700
He repelled the kid's Rasen Shuriken!

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.270
It's not over yet!

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:39.870
Sage Jutsu!

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.330
Rasengan Barrage!

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.470
What?!

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.530
All right!

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.870
Way to go, kid!

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.470
Two more left!

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.130
But...what did that kid just do?

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.400
Back there, the first Rasen Shuriken

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.430
was a transformation by Naruto-boy himself.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.200
That Pain was unaware of that and tried to absorb that jutsu.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.900
I get it. So that's why Naruto appeared.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.670
Pain can only absorb ninjutsu.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.830
So he took a direct hit when Naruto tackled him.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.330
I see... The three-stage attack was for that purpose.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.830
Back there...

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.630
He had already slipped into the smoke and jumped up above.

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:11.530
Just barely in time...

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.470
Almighty Push!

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.670
Are you all right, Naruto-boy?!

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.000
Yeah...

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.200
Damn it! What was that jutsu just now?!

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.730
It seems the core Pain's power has returned.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.230
You mean, him?

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.400
No doubt he used the same jutsu to blow up the village.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.030
The more power he uses,

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:14.170
the longer the interval before he can use the next jutsu.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.530
So that's why he couldn't use that repelling jutsu until just now.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.530
What are my options?

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.270
Ninjutsu and taijutsu won't work.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.570
Choji brought us information.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:33.600
The minimum interval between Pain's jutsu is about five seconds.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.870
You must target and strike during that interval.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.200
Only five seconds?

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.270
You'll have to trap him with genjutsu.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.230
But how?! I suck at genjutsu!

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.300
We'll do it!

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.200
Just like before.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.230
Just like before?

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.330
Yes. During the battle between Jiraiya-boy and Pain,

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.670
that was our means of escape.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.370
There's nowhere for you to escape now!

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.000
Almighty Push...

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:34.530
Chief Toad!

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.330
Damn it!

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.070
This is the farthest Pain has ever been pushed.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.270
But rest assured.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.670
You will not be killed.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.730
You are a precious Jinchuriki.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.670
Indeed, Sage Mode is trouble.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.530
But this way, you are helpless.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.700
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Nine-Tails, Captured!"

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.900
I'm losing...power...

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.170
It's hard to believe Manda has passed away.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.370
I never liked that guy even up until the very end.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.330
I remember people used to call us "The Three-Way Deadlock."

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.500
Maybe I will miss him a little... "Three-way Deadlock"?

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.300
That literally means that frogs fear snakes,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.630
snakes fear slugs, and slugs fear frogs.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.370
Wait?! That makes our current situation...

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.300
Pops, toss me some good escargot, will ya?

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.300
Escargot?!

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.630
I'll try... But I am ungraceful, you see.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.000
Yikes!

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.670
O-Oh no! I just remembered some urgent business. I must be going...

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.930
H-H-Help!

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.930
What's with her?

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.900
I don't know... I'm ungraceful, you see.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.130
Tune in again
