WEBVTT

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.880
WIND

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.300
Welcome.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.760
It's been a while Lord Sixth.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.390
I apologize for being late.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.350
Have the other Kage arrived already?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.390
Yes, they just arrived.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.430
6TH HOKAGE I don't see the Mizukage…

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.180
6TH HOKAGE Due to inclement weather en route,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.140
6TH HOKAGE they are running about a half a day behind.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.800
6TH HOKAGE During this time,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.300
6TH HOKAGE please relax and enjoy what our village has to offer.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.100
I've assigned Hidden Leaf Shinobi to accompany you.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.470
By the way, Lord Sixth.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.100
I understand Naruto is going to marry.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.970
Yes, so you've heard?

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.800
I've prepared a wedding gift from the Hidden Rock.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.140
May I ask you to present it at the wedding celebration?

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.260
The Hidden Cloud will also be sending a gift.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.970
I ask the same of you.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.550
I understand.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.100
I'm sure Naruto will be very happy.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.140
Naruto…is getting married, huh?

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.070
The Kazekage's Wedding Gift

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.970
We didn't hear anything about Naruto getting married!

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.640
Temari, you were here just a little while ago…

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.010
You must've heard about it!

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.890
Y-Yeah… Why didn't you tell us?!

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.180
Shut up! I forgot, okay?!

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.970
What's come over you?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.800
Y-You're being scary.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.350
In any case, we should prepare a wedding gift.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.550
Since it will be from the Kazekage, we should get something extravagant.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.970
Extravagant, huh?

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.220
Do you think Naruto would appreciate that?

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.850
You think Naruto wouldn't be happy with something extravagant?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.680
CONGRATULATIONS!

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.850
When you put it that way…

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.010
Gaara! It's been a very long time!

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.220
Yes, it certainly has.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.850
We are going to show you around the village

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.260
until Lord Mizukage arrives!

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.800
Hey, Lee.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.550
He's here for the Five Kage Conference

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.640
and we're on duty as well.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.100
Don't get too casual.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.600
No, let's not stand on ceremony.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.850
We appreciate your company.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.260
We're looking forward to it.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.140
So, is there somewhere you want to go first?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.100
Let's see…

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.430
Actually, I want to know what kinds of things Naruto likes.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.100
What Naruto likes?

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.600
Let's see…

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.510
I know just the place!

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.010
I'll take you there now!

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.010
Great. Are you both coming?

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.180
Of course!

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.970
I'm just going to relax here.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.180
It will be awkward if I run into him.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.180
What's up, Temari?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.930
You seem weirdly irritated…

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.180
There's nothing going on!

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.300
You guys just go!

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.600
RAMEN ICHIRAKU

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.850
Hello!

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.640
Oh! Welcome, Iruka Sensei!

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.390
I'd like a large miso char siu ramen.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.890
Sure thing!

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.550
But, Iruka Sensei, you've been coming around a lot lately.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.430
Don't be rude, Ayame!

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.010
He's a very important customer!

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.510
What's going on with you? You seem to be troubled.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.970
Well…

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.430
Everyone's in a tizzy over what to get Naruto

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.350
for his wedding gift for the past few days.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.180
It doesn't involve me since I'm not a shinobi.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.300
But I still want to give him something. And I came up with…

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.010
this!

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.680
FREE RAMEN PASS ICHIRAKU A free ramen pass?

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.850
Oh! Not this.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.300
RAMEN FREE PASS FOR ONE YEAR ICHIRAKU

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.100
I see… He gets to eat free ramen for a limited time.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.680
I'm sure this'll make him very happy.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.600
But I wonder about a whole year…

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.640
A year is too long.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.760
Too long… RAMEN FREE PASS FOR SIX MONTHS ICHIRAKU

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.180
It's the same with half a year.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.970
Yeah, you're right…

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.010
I see.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.180
You want to give Naruto a wedding gift too?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.050
He'll definitely be overjoyed!

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.850
So, does that mean you have something already, Lee?

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.970
Of course!

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.050
I see.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.220
This is the first time I'm getting something like a wedding gift.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.800
I don't have a clue on what to get.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.010
Then you must consider what a wedding is in the first place!

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.970
What is a wedding ceremony?

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.350
What is absolutely necessary for a wedding ceremony?

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.050
Wouldn't that be…love?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.890
I'm getting a bad feeling about this…

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.050
"What is a wedding ceremony?"

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.100
That's a very philosophical question.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.510
Yes, it is.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.850
So think about it this way…

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.470
What is absolutely necessary for a wedding ceremony?

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.010
Absolutely necessary for a wedding…?

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.550
Wouldn't that be…love?

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.010
Yes!

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.430
LOVE That was my answer too!

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.430
LOVE Why is this going exactly the same way as before?!

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.140
However, my mentor whom I greatly respect, Guy Sensei,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.010
didn't stop there.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.010
He realized that it's the bride and groom

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.010
who are most important in a wedding…

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.970
and if you put yourself into their shoes,

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.100
you would see what would be the best gift.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.680
And the result of that was…

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.430
I got them dumbbells!

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.100
D-Dumbbells?

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.430
I'm only a shinobi…

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.510
so I think that's most suitable thing for me to present.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.720
However, Gaara, you are the Kazekage, so we must consider your position.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.720
So, I think some extravagant barbells would be great!

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.050
B-Barbells, huh…

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.050
I don't know about barbells…

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.260
But I agree with the "extravagant" part.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.260
ICHIRAKU – Hello! – Welcome!

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.850
Iruka Sensei!

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.180
Hey, Lee! We meet again!

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.890
Gaara, let me introduce Iruka Sensei, Naruto's teacher.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.140
Iruka Sensei, this is Gaara the Kazekage!

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.180
H-How do you do?

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.850
Why is Lord Kazekage with you two?

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.010
We've been assigned to show him around the village

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.140
until the Five Kage Conference begins.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.800
Gaara is also thinking about a wedding gift for Naruto.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.100
Naruto and Gaara are friends.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:42.680
Friends?!

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.470
Anyway, we're going to send an extravagant gift

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.640
representative of the Hidden Sand.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.930
I'm very grateful to the Lord Kazekage

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.100
for making such an extravagant gesture…

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.720
and I'm sure Naruto will be overjoyed as well.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.970
Now, if you will please excuse me.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.550
See? Naruto's gonna be happy!

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.180
His own teacher confirmed that.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.350
You think so?

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.470
One thing's for sure, Naruto loves flashy things!

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.010
There's no way he won't be happy with an extravagant gift.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.470
I see… I guess I'm gonna go big and grand too,

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.050
and give him a year's free pass—

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.260
Father…

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.760
Y-Yes…

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.100
Pops, I'll have a large miso char siu ramen!

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.180
What is that?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.930
Naruto's favorite item on the menu.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.550
It has an extravagant helping of char sui.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.720
Even his ramen is extravagant?

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.720
Then I'll have that too.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.970
Me too.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:49.760
Okay, Pops… A large miso char siu ramen for all of us!

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.010
Hold it!

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.800
Make mine a regular, without char siu, and for the topping…

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.050
Topping?

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.430
Seems Naruto fish cake is ranked number one.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.600
Way back, it used to be the least popular.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.760
These days, it's Naruto fish cake, hands down.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.850
That's the kinda effect he's had.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.140
Then I'll have the regular miso ramen,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.890
with the Naruto fishcake topping.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.100
Please add that to mine too.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.970
TOPPING MENU #1 NARUTO FISHCAKE #2 CHAR SIU #3 MENMA All right! I'll give you an extravagant helping of the topping!

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.640
Boy, did we eat.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.680
Where would you like to go next?

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.350
Are you all right?

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.550
You've been deep in thought this whole time.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.300
I was thinking about what to give Naruto as the Kazekage.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.100
As the Kazekage?

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.850
Kankuro wants to give something extravagant,

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.970
but that just doesn't sit right with me.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.260
I see… Hey, c'mon, Gaara…

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.510
But after listening to Naruto's teacher

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.140
and the ramen shop's proprietor, I'm convinced.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.220
As long as it makes Naruto happy.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.890
That's more like it!

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.510
I'll help in any way I can too!

00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.970
– Huh? – Huh?

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.100
Huh?

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.300
Hey, you Hidden Sand and Leaf guys!

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.010
Guess who I am, yay!

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.850
What an awful rap…

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.970
You're Lord Killer Bee, the bodyguard of Lord Raikage, right?

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.720
Isn't anyone accompanying you in the village?

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.100
I prefer my freedom.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.050
My brother's at the conference reception.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.640
Me, I prefer a village exploration.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.140
By the way, Kazekage,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.600
are you planning on giving Naruto a wedding gift?

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.350
Yes, I intend to.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.100
Finding a gift is my personal mission.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.680
Let's do our best to make a good decision, yay.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.010
Sounds like the Hidden Cloud are really into this.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.140
Our gift will be something to marvel at.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.350
Listen well and remember that.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.970
Seriously? Do you have to answer in rap all the time?

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.180
PURE SAKE LONG LIFE LIGHTNING CONGRATULATIONS Decorated for a special occasion…

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.350
PURE SAKE LONG LIFE LIGHTNING CONGRATULATIONS Sake produced by the Hidden Cloud…

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.800
Ten giant kegs of which we're proud, yay.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.220
Hidden Cloud beef of super high-quality…

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.800
We'll present it roasted whole, in its entirety, yay.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.140
Premium games… The best of the best.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.260
Ten great games, no less. Yay!

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.010
That sums up my presentation.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.010
A wedding's an important celebration.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.100
Yay.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.180
A-Amazing!

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.720
I didn't get the details because of your rap…

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.180
but I did get that it'll be extravagant.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.300
So what's the Hidden Sand getting?

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.010
Have you already ordered it?

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.100
Well…that's just it.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.220
Okay! Okay!

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.100
I apologize, I should have realized…

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.100
Our gifts are so extravagant that it's made you hesitant.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.350
But that's not important.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.220
Huh?

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.970
Doesn't matter if it's not fancy,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.300
what comes from the heart is the best choice.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.050
That's what'll make Naruto rejoice, yay!

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.100
Don't patronize us!

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.100
K-Kankuro?!

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.640
We're gonna give a gift that equals the Hidden Cloud's!

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.930
We plan to cover the reception hall

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.390
with flowers grown in the Hidden Sand!

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.300
And to highlight the celebration dinner,

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.850
we'll send the finest tuna in the land…a whole bluefin!

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:13.010
And we'll prepare boxes of sweets as wedding favors for every guest!

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.970
How's that?!

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.350
Hold it. Who said anything about—?

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.930
Amazing!

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.050
You came up with all that in such a short time!

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.100
No…we haven't decided—

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.430
Oh, I forgot something important.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.300
Fool, ya fool.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.050
For entertainment, Brother might perchance…

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.800
perform the "Hidden Cloud Dance."

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.550
Yay.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.640
The Raikage… The Hidden Cloud Dance, you say?!

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.470
No, no, no… no way, no way… So now you get the drift…

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.050
How the party will get a lift, yay

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.800
T-This is bad! At this rate… Gaara will lose!

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.010
No, giving a gift isn't about winning or losing.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.640
Dance... Huh?

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.010
Show up the Raikage… and dance too, Gaara!

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.550
That is the only way!

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.920
The Mizukage should be arriving soon.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.250
Then we should call the Kazekage.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.210
Lord Kakashi… Drop the "lord."

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.380
We received a request to adjust the entertainment time

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.340
allotted at Naruto and Hinata's wedding reception.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.340
Huh? What's that?

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.300
How come I wasn't told about a wedding reception?!

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.630
At whose request?

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.090
It's from…Lord Raikage's bodyguard… What?!

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.130
He mentioned the "Hidden Cloud Dance" by the Raikage.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.710
Okay! Gaara will do the "Hidden Sand Samba."

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.250
Oh! This is getting more and more exciting.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.380
Stop joking. I can't dance.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.500
Besides, it wouldn't make Naruto happy.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.630
Actually, I think he might take the initiative and join in.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.380
W-What…?!

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:09.670
Y-You're right.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:10.880
Still…

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.880
The Kazekage shouldn't dance in front of people!

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.460
But he said the Raikage is going to dance!

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.340
The Raikage's gift of dance is a must-see

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.920
If you miss this opportunity, behind the times you'll be, yay.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.960
That fool!

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.170
I beg your pardon if I make a scene…

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.670
No, I doubt there will be a need for you to intervene.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.130
DUMPLINGS The Raikage's wedding gift of dance is a must-see

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.500
If you miss this opportunity, behind the times you'll be, yay.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.050
Wedding… Behind the times?

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.920
I'll kill you.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.550
I now call this Five Kage Conference to order.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.130
However, before we begin…

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.050
In regard to wedding gifts for Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga…

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.500
I ask that you use your good sense and keep things in moderation.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.050
And so, let's move on to our agenda.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.800
H-Hey…

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.500
S-Sorry about last time.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.460
No… I'm sorry as well.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.250
Want to get a bite to eat?

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.210
Might as well…

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.500
LEAF INN RESERVED FOR A SPECIAL EVENT TODAY

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.960
Lord Kazekage… So, you were still here in the village!

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.920
The conference ran long…

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.920
So, I decided to stay the night.

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.590
I'm grateful that you've chosen our ramen for dinner!

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.960
Well… I've never had anything so delicious.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.210
And I've never had such a compliment.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.000
By the way, I heard about the remarks Lord Hokage made

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.210
about Naruto and Hinata's wedding gifts…

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.000
It was to be expected.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.420
Things were getting out of hand.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.420
I'm sure everyone's feeling remorseful now.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.340
Even I…

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.000
And I went overboard too. I apologize.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.550
Don't worry about it.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:17:59.960
Oh! Iruka Sensei.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.090
Welcome!

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.670
Lord Kazekage… I just overheard you.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.880
I want to apologize too.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.920
But Naruto's teacher shouldn't…

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.380
When I met you last time…

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.960
I'm very grateful to the Lord Kazekage

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.170
for making such an extravagant gesture…

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.750
and I'm sure Naruto will be overjoyed as well.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.090
I'm at fault too, for putting it like that.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.920
I'm very sorry.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.840
There's nothing to be sorry about!

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.300
I was just…simply happy.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.130
I learned that Naruto has wonderful friends

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:40.300
who will go above and beyond to celebrate him.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.960
Friends…huh.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.800
Thank you very much.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.090
No, I want to thank you too.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:48.920
Huh?

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.590
I was confused, and you've cleared it up for me.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.800
I was thinking only about appearances,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.460
and forgot the most basic thing.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.500
What do you mean?

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.710
I'm going to honor Naruto not as the Kazekage,

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.840
but as his friend.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.050
Would that be all right?

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.000
Of course.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.590
A large miso char siu ramen with Naruto fishcake topping!

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.000
Oh, thank you.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.710
What'll you have, Iruka Sensei?

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.840
Make mine the same…

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.300
A large miso char siu ramen with Naruto fishcake topping.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.250
Coming right up!

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.840
Dad, I'm done cleaning up here.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.380
Okay, thanks!

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.000
Not going home yet?

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.670
I'm gonna go on ahead.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.550
Make sure you lock up!

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.590
All right… Finished!

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.250
NARUTO CONGRATULATIONS ALL YOU CAN EAT FOREVER

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.380
Have a safe trip back home.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.050
Gaara! Please come again!

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.420
It would be great if you come back on your own next time,

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.210
and not on official Kazekage business.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.090
Yes, that won't be too long from now.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.960
For Naruto and Hinata's wedding.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.340
I'm sorry, but I don't plan on bringing

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.340
a special gift from the Hidden Sand.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.920
Huh? Why?

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.920
Let him finish!

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.590
I want to honor them personally, as a friend.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.250
I think that will please Naruto more.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.000
Gaara!

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.300
Gaara…

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.800
Yes, please do that.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.050
I think it turned out for the best.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.960
Feels like everything's all settled!

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.090
You're in a good mood, Temari.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.090
N-No, I'm not!

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.960
Besides, seeing you so depressed is more shocking, Kankuro!

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.340
You can't blame him,

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.750
since we're not going all out with an extravagant gift.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.920
No, that doesn't bother me.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.130
I'm just disappointed we won't get to see you dance, Gaara.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.920
No, there's still hope!

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.170
He can dance as Naruto's friend!

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.380
No chance.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.820
16 MORE DAYS UNTIL THE WEDDING

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:41.750
To the one million Shino fans out there,

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.960
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.130
It's been said for over ten years that I don't stand out much.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.090
Finally, a story with me as the lead!

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.000
It's because I've been chosen to go on a mission

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.550
to find a wedding gift for Hinata!

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:52.500
And there–

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.880
Sorry to keep you all waiting!

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.800
I play an active role next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.920
"Hidden Leaf Story, The Perfect Day for a Wedding, Part 5: The Last Mission"

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.250
I'm the lead! Oh, where's Shino?

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.380
Is it true that I don't stand out?

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:28.710
Tune in again!
