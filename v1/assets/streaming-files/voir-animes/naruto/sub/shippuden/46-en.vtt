00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.300
You're the one... who hurt Sakura, Naruto.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.400
Naruto...

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.900
you...

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.830
don't...remember anything...?

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.300
Then...that bridge... and that crater...

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.570
Yes, you  did it...

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.870
And Sakura's wound as well...!

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.200
That's right!

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.730
Sakura didn't want to hurt you...

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.230
so she lied to you.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.930
I'm also responsible for Sakura getting injured.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.800
And here I was assigned to Team Kakashi...

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.130
for a time like this...

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.130
I have special powers...

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.700
with which I can control your Nine-Tails power.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.300
So you don't really need to worry.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.830
At least... while I'm by your side.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.000
In other words, I didn't have to go to the trouble

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.200
of telling you the truth at this point...

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.630
But why did I tell you?

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.200
There's no doubt that using that power

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.170
might be a quick way for you to save Sasuke.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.630
But strength gained from relying on the Nine-Tails...

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.800
is not your true power.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.570
You'll end up tormenting yourself if you rely on the power...

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.200
of the Nine-Tails from here on.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.830
And it could turn into a power that hurts your friends.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.300
Like what happened this time.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.770
You should already have vaguely picked up on it.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.500
But you didn't attempt to stop the release of the power...

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.430
That's because you were impatient, right?

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.770
I will now completely suppress your Nine-Tails power.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.600
But you're sorely mistaken...

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.970
if you think that will make you weaker.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.670
You should be sufficiently powerful...

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.800
without having to rely on that Chakra.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.770
I think you've got the wrong idea about this.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.600
The source of your strength isn't the Nine-Tails Chakra.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.830
It's the power of your own Chakra...

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.430
that can withstand the formidable Nine-Tails Chakra.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.600
If you want to save Sasuke, do it with your own power.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.770
If you want to see Sasuke...

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.830
do it with your own eyes, not the Nine-Tails'.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.700
And if you want to protect Sakura...

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.930
do it with your own power, not the Nine-Tails'!

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.430
Right!

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.000
The Unfinished Page 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.470
Kabuto... Take care of that after we get back.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.030
No, you see...

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.930
if I don't wash these off as soon as possible,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.170
the cutting quality will deteriorate just like that...

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.300
It's okay... The pain's starting to go away.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.930
Are Naruto and the captain still at it?

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:01.430
Oh yeah...

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.930
Come to think of it, the thing I picked up earlier...

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.730
It's gone...

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.230
Here it is...

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.170
Please go on ahead.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.400
I'll catch up once I've tidied up.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.030
I'll help.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.500
This...isn't printed.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.770
Did you draw this, too?

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.300
Yes.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.400
Wow, it's a picture book, huh?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.700
Can I take a look at it along the way?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.570
I can't let you see it.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.600
It's not finished yet...

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.100
And I don't hand this over to people.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.270
This is my older brother's book, so...

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.530
Just as I thought, it's gone...

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:55.300
How can I... be sure that's true?

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.400
I lost it back then, huh...?

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.570
Is something the matter, Sai?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.730
No... It's nothing...

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.600
I see...

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.070
More importantly, Master Orochimaru...

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.470
When we get back, can you give me...

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.030
an intact male corpse as quickly as possible?

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.970
Don't you still have bodies in stock?

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.200
Yes, I do...

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.770
But I'm out of the fifteen to sixteen-year-old...

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.470
We lost one in the incident earlier, so...

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.400
It doesn't feel right...

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.670
unless they are always stored properly in order of age inside the scroll.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.830
Kabuto... Are you type-A blood?

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.530
No...I'm AB...

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.270
I see... That's surprising...

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.270
Not really.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.170
Okay, shall we get going pretty soon...?

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.130
We have a little further to go before reaching the hideout.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.600
First, take a look at this diagram.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.870
This is a diagram of a formation for cornering an enemy.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.300
In actual missions, various scenarios can develop...

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.600
depending on the number of enemies and number of allies.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.070
First off...

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.370
What's the deal...

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.300
with this book...?

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.700
And then... in a scenario like this...

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.170
Hey, are you liste-- Both of you, come here a minute!

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.470
Hurry!

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.330
Is something wrong, Sakura?

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.530
Look at this.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.530
Oh! That's Sai's...

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.770
That's the picture book we picked up that Sai drew, huh?

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.830
What's in it?

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.830
If we figure that out,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.230
we might be able to find out a little about Sai...

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.870
Right. That's what I was thinking, so I tried reading it, but...

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.030
What kind of a story is it?

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.200
Actually... I don't really know...

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.200
Why?

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.730
What do you mean?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.000
There are no words or dialogue at all...

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.500
You're right...

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.470
It kind of...

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.930
looks like a story about the two boys on the front and back cover...

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.070
And...it's got the story of the two boys...

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.930
starting from both title pages of the book...

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.800
and progressing to the middle...

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.270
When you look at the book starting with this boy with black hair...

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.300
the next page...

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.330
always has the same boy on the right page...

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.600
And there's a different person drawn on each left page...

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.730
See...?

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.030
Huh...?!

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.400
This is... Go back!

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:16.700
I knew it...

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:22.570
This kid...looks a little different when you go to the next page.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.100
You're right...

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.900
And look...

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.470
He has the same weapon as the guy drawn on the previous page...

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.230
Hmm, it looks like it's a story where the boy defeats enemies...

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.300
Look at this... After fighting,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.030
he takes the enemy's weapon and armor...

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800
Just as I thought...

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.170
The next page... and the next page, too...

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.030
Oh, come to think of it!

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.230
I knew it... The positioning is reversed...

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.430
but this boy with the white hair is the same, too.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.230
So it's a story where these boys grow by battling enemies, huh...?

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.430
Just a minute...

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.030
If they're defeating enemies from both sides...

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.830
then what happens at the end?!

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.000
That's the problem.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.430
Look...

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.230
What's up with...this picture?

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.500
This is a strange picture.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.800
In this picture book...

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.400
only the facing pages in the middle are incomplete...

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.470
This is...kind of creepy...

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.730
He said it wasn't finished...

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.530
But why isn't there a face drawn in...?

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.670
Doesn't...the guy with the black hair...

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.330
kind of look like Sai?

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.730
You're right.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.500
Did he draw himself...?

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.730
Then who is this boy... with the white hair?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.400
I can't let you see it. It's not finished yet.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:17.130
And I don't hand this over to people.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.600
This is my older brother's book, so...

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:22.970
Could it be...

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.170
It's Sai's... older brother...?

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.370
If you have a brother, you should be able to imagine

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.130
what it would be like to lose him, right?

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.100
Yeah, well...you could say that...

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.770
My brother's dead, after all.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.130
Then this...

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.930
These facing pages in the center...

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.300
It's Sai...and his older brother...

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.300
Let's go.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.430
Yes, sir.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.730
Over there, huh...?

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.700
Sai's older brother... Don't tell me!

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.630
Could it be...?!

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.670
It appears my clone has located the hideout.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.970
Let's get going.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.230
That's...

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.200
You're late...

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.870
What's this feeling? What's this chill and sweat?

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.330
I'm not supposed to have any emotions.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.430
Don't tell me that just by looking into his eyes for an instant

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:53.770
I feared him within the depths of my soul that even I can't perceive?!

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.000
Is he Sasuke Uchiha,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.300
the man Naruto has continued to search for all this time?!

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.400
Next time: "Infiltration: The Den of the Snake!"
