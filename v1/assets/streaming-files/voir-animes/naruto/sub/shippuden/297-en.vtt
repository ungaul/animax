00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.820
Bugs are super gross!

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.280
There are bugs here too!

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.660
Bugs! Everywhere!

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.250
Good job.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.880
What happened to the ones who haven't returned?

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.750
What's up with these bugs?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.880
Chase 'em away, Tsukune! I can't stand bugs.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.090
But these aren't ordinary bugs!

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.010
Cut it out, you guys.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.520
It's because those insects are my friends.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.890
– These bugs are your friends? – These bugs are your friends?

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.390
What's up with this old guy?

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.900
Those kids!

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.770
This period is for extracurricular work.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.860
Where did they go?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.320
– Wow! Amazing! – Wow! Amazing!

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.200
Cool!

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.030
I've never seen an Insect User before!

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.200
They'd be a huge hit at a party!

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.750
No way… The party would be crawling with bugs.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.790
It seems you don't like insects.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.830
However, if you keep living with them,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.250
you become quite attached to them.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.090
Y-You're right… They're kinda cute.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.760
I wanna try too!

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.680
Do you think you want to become an Insect User?

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.310
Not gonna happen. This guy wants to become the future Hokage.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.770
The Hokage?

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.690
I wanna surpass Naruto Uzumaki as a shinobi.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.690
I see. Well, if you want to surpass Naruto,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.230
you'll have to become the Hokage.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.280
You think so too?

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.400
Then I guess while I'm at it, I'll become the Hokage too.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.830
I know someone else who wants to become the Hokage.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.370
But kid, you're the top contender.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.250
It's because I don't know anyone who says he'll become the Hokage

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.130
as an afterthought.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.590
Right? See I'm the top contender!

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.050
You just talk big!

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.260
Shut up! You just watch me ten years from now!

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.930
Are you aiming to become the Hokage too?

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.890
No, I never gave it a thought.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.520
So, you wanted to become an Insect User?

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.980
Yeah…that's right.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.900
What's necessary to realize a dream?

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.780
I want to take that first step as soon as I can!

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.740
The first step in realizing your dream is…

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.990
Hey, what time is it?

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.450
Uh-oh! We forgot about class!

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.370
You'd better hurry back. And do your best to surpass Naruto.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.290
Yeah! I'm gonna reach my dream, just like you Big Bro!

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.790
See ya!

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.970
Dream…huh?

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.780
The Last Mission

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.770
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.320
You're late, Shino!

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.980
So? How'd it go?

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.150
It seems just about everyone's gotten their wedding gift.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.490
Oh yeah? I guess we'd better decide soon too.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.990
Hey, Shino…

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.620
Kakashi Sensei said this was a mission, right?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.790
I understand why Kakashi Sensei and the others are putting it that way.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.840
But to me, this is a serious mission.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.640
It's our final mission as Team 8.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.310
Team 8's final mission…

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.180
Once Hinata gets married,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.270
we won't get to work together like the way we used to, right?

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.060
Yes…

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.440
That's true…

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.900
And I have to get serious

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.530
if I intend on becoming the next Hokage.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.370
I can't keep relying on you.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.450
Yeah, let's keep it that way.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.250
What do you mean by that?!

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.830
Sorry.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.090
In any case, this is for Hinata, our last mission as Team 8…

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.630
Right?

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.470
Right.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.720
The question is… what do we get them?

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.300
– Hmm… – Hmm…

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.140
A gift for Hinata, huh?

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.890
It's gonna be from us to Hinata and Naruto.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.230
What would make them happy?

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.860
Akakiba!

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.110
Akakiba and Kibamaru!

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.950
You're mixing up the names… Give me a break, Mirai…

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.410
Rather than hot tea, I feel like relaxing with some shochu.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.290
Oh, that's right.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.460
Speaking of alcohol, have you heard about this story?

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.840
Back in the day, the Senju Clan had a custom of

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.010
giving honey wine as a wedding gift.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.140
Long ago, the Senju Clan who lived in the forest

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.300
discovered an unusual liquid that was produced by chance

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.020
from rainwater that collected in beehives.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.350
And that was the start of honey wine.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.810
It was a nourishing, yet rare wine.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.940
And since the olden days,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.940
it's been served only during auspicious occasions.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.360
Honey wine could be used as a medicinal tonic

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.900
as well as for cooking.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.490
Hinata would find some good uses for it.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.830
She may appreciate something like this!

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.620
And it conveys the wish that Hinata and Naruto

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.250
spend their days in sweetness.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.420
That's a cheesy joke.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.340
Hinata wouldn't find it funny!

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.390
It's strange seeing you two so lively without Hinata…

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.930
But I guess you'll get used to it.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.640
Anyway, where do we find this honey wine?

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.020
SORAKU I heard there's a place called Soraku.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.230
And it seems the beekeeper who lives there makes honey wine.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.280
Finding people is your specialty, right?

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.410
Okay, it's decided.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.030
Let's go find this beekeeper.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.740
Bye bye, Kibamaru! Akakiba!

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.120
It's Team 8's final mission!

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.920
Let's go, guys!

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.880
Our last mission, huh?

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.340
What a desolate place…

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.720
And it's pretty depressing too.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.220
Sorry, it's so depressing, meow.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.560
Judging from your headbands, you're Hidden Leaf shinobi, meow?

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.610
You reek of dogs, you reek of bugs, and you're a real dog.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.860
Damn it, what a sorry bunch, meow.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.280
A ninja cat?!

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.290
We're looking for a beekeeper who lives in a place called Soraku.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.160
We're not sketchy guys.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.870
Meow, you're totally sketchy, meow!

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.920
I've got nothing to tell you, meow.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.510
So that means you know where this beekeeper is, right?

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.970
Okay, how about we catch it and get the info out of it?

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.970
Let's do it, Akamaru!

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.720
Dumb humans, meow!

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.810
H-Hey!

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.940
Insect Summoning Jutsu!

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.860
Saved!

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.660
You're gonna mess around with us?!

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.870
Fine, then…

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.910
Tadah!

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040
Here.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.160
What is this?!

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.040
This is catnip.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.960
It's very similar to silver vine.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.210
Well?

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.090
Can't ignore it, can you?

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.470
Damn it… My pride would never forgive me

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.970
if I got caught by someone who reeks like a dog.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.100
Hey!

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.770
Don't steal it! You damn cat!

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.690
Momo!

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.020
Who are you guys?

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:12.820
How dare you chase after my Momo!

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.030
Must be that ninja cat's master.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.360
Be careful, Kiba, Akamaru!

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.950
Oh…her name's Momo?

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.620
Fancy that… My dog's name is Akamaru.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.870
K-Kiba?

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.840
By any chance, was my cat rude to you?

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.010
I'm so sorry.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.090
No, no… She's a cute ninja cat.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.310
Just a minute ago, you called me a "damn cat."

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.720
My name is Tamaki.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.890
I'm Kiba…

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.730
This is my ninja hound, Akamaru.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.400
You're a ninja hound user?!

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.900
Amazing!

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.990
Oh, it's nothing.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:01.910
Although…I'm on the inside track to become the next Hokage.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.540
The next Lord Hokage?!

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.830
What's really amazing!
Nah…

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.830
But what is an important person like you

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.210
doing in a place like this?

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.590
Actually…we're looking for a beekeeper who lives in Soraku.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.550
Would you like me to guide you part of the way?

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.720
You know him?

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.850
That would be great!

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.560
Right, Shino?

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.940
He lives in the bamboo grove beyond here.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.150
You probably won't be able to find him.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.410
Even cats get lost in this grove, meow.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.530
We're shinobi!

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.740
We won't get lost.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.870
Well then, be careful.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.450
Yeah! Thanks!

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.930
Yes, I know.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:08.980
Intruders…

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.940
First, I'll track him with my nose.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.820
And if I find him, send in your insects.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.820
That girl might be talking about us.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.700
Are you in love with her?

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.620
Huh?! Are you crazy?!

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.950
It's nothing like that!

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.670
This is a crucial time if I'm gonna become the Hokage!

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.790
I have no time to fall in love!

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.840
You're easy to read.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.920
Huh? What did you say?

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.880
Nothing. I just said I envy you.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.890
Huh? Really?

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.180
And I have to get serious

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.730
if I intend to become the next Hokage.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:58.570
Kiba always talks big, and maybe I viewed him with indifference…

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.900
However…

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.410
What's necessary to realize a dream?

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.450
I want to take that first step as soon as I can!

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.700
The first step in realizing your dream…

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.750
Who am I to criticize anyone?

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.130
Once Hinata gets married,

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.170
we won't get to work together like the way we used to, right?

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.840
"The way we used to," huh?

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.140
Kiba!

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.770
Hey, Kiba!

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560
Where are you?!

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.900
Really? You guys don't know either?

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.990
This is definitely someone's jutsu…

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.540
Yellow jackets?!

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.420
What is this jutsu?!

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.680
You belong to the Aburame Clan of Hidden Leaf Village.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.720
Correct.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.730
You're skilled to be able to deceive me…

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.360
But how?

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.860
The poison should have… The poison got me…

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.440
But it's not a problem.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.200
It's because this amount of poison won't kill me.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.870
Well now, it's my loss. It can't be helped.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.500
I'm proud to die by the hand of an Insect User of your caliber.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.870
No, hold on.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.500
I don't want your life.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.420
I want your honey wine.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.890
Thank you, how much do I owe you?

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.640
I don't want money.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.850
You can take it. It means nothing.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.850
I see…

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.560
Now, if you can tell me the road back, I'd be grateful.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.150
There is no road.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.820
What do you mean?

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.450
Exactly what I said.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.410
This bamboo grove is surrounded by something like a barrier.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.870
Once you step inside, there's no way out.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.830
You'll continue to wander through an endless fog…that is all…

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.880
That's the kind of jutsu this is.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.590
What?!

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.850
I'm sorry to tell you that this jutsu cannot be broken.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.720
Even if you kill me…

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.310
What do you mean?!

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.600
Originally, this mist contained

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.810
a special component meant to lead people astray.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.820
I incorporated a little of it into my jutsu formula…

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.120
But that can't be why you can't break the jutsu?

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.950
No… But, the nasty thing about this jutsu is…

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.750
…that it takes the doubt inside of its victims and turns it into fog,

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.750
making it thicker and thicker…

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.340
What?!

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.670
Haven't you noticed?

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.880
This bamboo grove makes people lose their way…

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.720
and when the jutsu is used,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.640
a thicker fog confuses them even more.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.810
In other words,

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.730
this jutsu has no effect on someone who has no doubts.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.400
So…you're saying I have doubts?

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.780
Yeah! I'm gonna reach my dream, just like you!

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.530
Once Hinata gets married,

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.660
we won't be working together the way we used to, right?

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.410
It's strange seeing you two so lively without Hinata…

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.870
But I guess you'll get used to it.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.290
I understand…

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.090
I've been questioning how to live as a shinobi

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.100
after Team 8 disbands when Hinata gets married.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.810
To be together always, with my friends in Team 8.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.310
That was my dream.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.900
I see… I was doubting myself…

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.660
You and I are alike.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.990
I'm still lost on this path called life.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.200
So, how about it?

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.830
There is doubt, but there is no suffering here.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.330
I am finally living life now!

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.250
Your friends understand too!

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.380
It's okay to have doubts…

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.010
It's not your fault that you have doubts…

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.510
Kiba… Hinata…

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.560
It's not necessary to move forward.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.400
Abandon it all, and stay here with your doubts.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.360
If you agree, stay with us…

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.190
C'mon, Shino…

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.200
It's Team 8's final mission!

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.330
Let's go, guys!

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:05.830
No…

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.880
That's not what…I'm looking for…

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.210
What?

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.170
What I'm looking for is…

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.140
What I'm looking for…

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.010
…is to be with my friend who keeps moving forward.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.480
Not someone who stays in the same place with me!

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.190
I can't be stuck here like this.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.520
I have to return to the village right away.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.740
It's because…I have to attend an important friend's wedding.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.120
You think you can find your way out of this fog?

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.040
When you're in so much doubt about your life?!

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Yeah.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.630
To make sure he can walk his path without worry,

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.710
I'm definitely gonna find my path in life.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.670
And I have no doubt about that!

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:04.890
An entrance…

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.020
No, it's the exit.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.150
So, you were able to see

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.110
the path beyond the guardian deity of travelers.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.820
I see… Then go quickly.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.870
Before you lose the path.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.750
Wait… You just said you're living life now.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.160
But is that really true?

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.330
What?

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.460
Someone who remains stuck in the past,

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.590
and cannot see the future…

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.760
Is that really living?

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.760
I know people who live every moment,

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.270
striving as hard as they could to reach a goal that seems so far…

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.560
They're the ones who are really living life.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:50.270
That's my belief…

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.360
I'm shocked.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.020
You're nothing like the quiet man I thought you were…

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.820
You are very passionate on the inside.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.200
I feel like I'm being lectured by my teacher.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.070
What are you saying?

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.830
Now go.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.830
In time, I will be like you…

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.750
Where have you been?!

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.420
You disappeared suddenly!

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.510
Sorry.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.680
However, I got a hold of this.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.220
Whoa! When did you—!

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.020
I was sure you were lost.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:28.850
Yeah, I was lost.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.230
But I've found my way.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.070
It's because… Anyway, let's take this home, Akamaru!

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.940
What about that girl?

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.070
Huh?!

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.780
Why are you bringing that up again?!

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.950
Sorry.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.030
Damn it.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.790
Maybe I'll write her.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.460
Letters? How unlike you.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.040
Huh? Why?!

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.090
There's nothing wrong with letters. Right, Akamaru?!

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.510
Akamaru, not you too?!

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.930
Yikes! Bugs again!

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.220
It's so amazing!

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.890
Maybe I'll make my goal to become an Insect User too.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:08.770
Yeah…

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.640
I'd better get started too, or I won't become the Hokage.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.310
You're wrong, kid.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.690
You've already taken that step.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:17.770
Huh?

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:18.860
It's because…

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.110
Putting your goal into words…

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.990
…is the first step towards realizing one's dream.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.700
I got it!

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.370
Thanks, Big Bro!

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.660
Let's go!

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.670
Tsukune, come on!

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.830
Yeah!

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:42.720
Iruka Sensei… You completely won over those bad kids.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.590
Maybe you should become a teacher.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720
A teacher?!

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.600
It's difficult even for us to keep up with

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.310
mischievous kids like that year after year.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.190
You're quite impressive.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.150
It's not that difficult for me.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:58.690
It's because…

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.980
I've always been around…

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.610
…the bad kids…

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.780
11 MORE DAYS UNTIL THE WEDDING

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.750
The wedding's coming up soon…

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.760
What's wrong Kakashi Sensei?

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.720
Huh?

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.630
I was really happy at first,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.550
but when I think about the upcoming wedding…

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.550
I haven't finished making all the rounds to greet people…

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.560
I haven't pinned down all of the expenses yet…

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.850
And I'm worried if everyone will make it or not…

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.270
Everything is just making me so anxious!

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.600
Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.110
Hidden Leaf Story, The Perfect Day for a Wedding, Part 6: The Whereabouts of the Secret Mission

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.860
You aren't suffering from cold feet, are you?

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:07.950
Who, me?!

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:28.720
Tune in again!
