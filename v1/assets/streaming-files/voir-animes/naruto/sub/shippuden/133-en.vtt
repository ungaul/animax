WEBVTT

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.770
You're late, Kankuro!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Assembling my new puppets took longer than I expected!

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.770
Lord Kazekage, have a safe journey.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.270
Lord Kankuro, Lady Temari... We're counting on you.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.930
We know.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.330
But Gaara doesn't really need bodyguards.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.570
We're off.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.030
Gaara will be the youngest member amongst the five Kage.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.370
Making sure the other Kage do not take him lightly will also be our duty.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.530
A Five Kage Summit Conference...

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.000
I wonder what the other Kage are like.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.000
Kurotsuchi, Akatsuchi, we're counting on you two!

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.300
Lord Tsuchikage!

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.370
Show the other Kage what you're made of!

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.830
Having to go to summits at my age is quite a chore.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.630
Look at those young ones romping around.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.670
They don't even know what it's like to have chronic back pain.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.130
Then maybe it's time to retire, Gramps.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.600
Why drag out the glory?

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.100
Let me carry that pack for you, Lord Tsuchikage!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.630
Hands off, Akatsuchi!

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.430
I don't need your help!

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.970
This is nothing.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.770
My back!

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.600
Well? Want to send someone else for you?

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.270
Y-You idiot!

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.470
Who do you think I am?!

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.970
I am the Tsuchikage,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.500
once feared as Ohnoki the Fence Sitter of the Hidden Stone!

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.800
Enough! I shall carry my own packs!

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.730
Jeez... What a stubborn old geezer!

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.300
Here, you can carry your own pack if you wish.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.230
Now let's go!

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.730
Of all the... Do as you please!

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.770
Just admit that's better, Gramps.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.600
Have a safe journey, Lord Tsuchikage!

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.670
Guard Lady Mizukage well.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.300
Make sure Lady Mizukage doesn't overdo things.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.770
I know.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.470
Thank you.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.270
Great Elder...

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.470
I swear upon my title of Mizukage to carry out my duties with brilliance.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.470
Chojuro, you are one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.370
Protect our Mizukage well.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.270
Y-Yes sir.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.970
We should be fine... I think.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.370
Have more confidence in yourself.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.930
You are strong.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.030
That is why I chose you to accompany me to the summit.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.170
Okay, Chojuro?

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.930
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
I can handle it...I think.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.530
She's so kind.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.400
"Yes, ma'am" would be enough!

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.870
Such an uncertain attitude will get you nowhere!

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.630
I swear, young people these days lack the dedication to manage themselves.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.300
MANAGE MARRIAGE  Marriage?

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.330
Ao! Enough with the lecturing!

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.630
Get going or you'll be late!

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.400
LATE...FOR MARRIAGE?! Late...for marriage?!

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.870
It's my way of offering advice! Why, in my day...

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.500
Shut up, or I'll kill you.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.170
Huh?!

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.270
All right, Chojuro, Ao... Let us go!

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.600
I will do everything to protect that smile on our gentle Lady Mizukage!

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.930
I hope I can.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.400
What are you doing, Ao?

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.300
Lady Mizukage has left.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.970
Oh, no!

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.830
Lady Mizukage, please wait for me!

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.730
Still no word from Team Samui?!

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.730
No, sir. But I do expect to hear something soon.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.870
And Samui has already been given the route you will take to the summit, Lord Raikage.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.600
She will either rendezvous with you directly, or send a messenger bird.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.870
Good! Then I shall be off as well!

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.530
Let us go! Shee! Darui!

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:28.430
Yes, sir!

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.930
Right.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.470
Follow me!

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.070
Not again!

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.300
Let's go, Darui.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.970
No... I'll just use the door.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.400
Go on, I'll catch up.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.070
"Enter the Five Kage!"

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.770
Lord Danzo...

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.800
I know.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.630
I haven't seen combat in a long time.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.800
This is the perfect opportunity to loosen my muscles.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.700
Do not interfere.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.770
I will handle them!

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.100
It hurts.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.900
It hurts.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.970
Is your target the Hokage, or me personally?

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.770
K-Kill me...

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.730
Well, not that it matters.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.230
Seven, eight, nine, ten...

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.500
Seventeen total, eh?

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.800
Okay! I'm ready!

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.330
It's not okay!

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.030
Are you serious about going to meet the Raikage?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.170
Yup.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.500
I'm going to ask him to forgive Sasuke.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.270
But if you don't even know where the Raikage is...

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.000
So please help him out, Yamato.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.870
What?!

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:57.970
See you.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.070
Kakashi...

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.370
I'm here to challenge you!

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.270
Brother Naruto!

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.900
Huh? That voice...

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.800
Please don't mention Naruto's actions when you report to the Hokage.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.370
Tell him there's been no movement.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.630
It seems you still do not trust me.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.370
You work under Danzo and your job is to keep an eye on Naruto.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.930
However, you are also a member of my Team 7.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.770
So I do believe in you.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.100
He said...he believed in me!

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.030
What is this feeling?

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.600
Catch you later!

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.130
These are remnants of the Hannya Black Ops from the Land of Woods

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.670
that we annihilated in the past.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.900
It's always been like this.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.530
Enemies looking for the slightest opportunity to strike.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.370
Now that you've come out of the shadows,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.400
things may become more troublesome for you, sir.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.200
A ninja lives in an ascetic world.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.800
To remain anonymous was a source of pride.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.770
But by exclusively controlling both the surface and the underground,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.130
one can truly strengthen village and nation.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.570
I will make certain that this summit is a success

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.930
and that I am recognized as the Hokage.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.230
Then the Jonin Council will have no choice but to accept me as their Hokage.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.200
My era has finally come.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.500
Hey... What's going on?

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.330
I'm not sure. What are those two up to?

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.200
- Sexy Jutsu! - Sexy Jutsu!

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.200
You can spy on Naruto in your dreams.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.800
Did you want to watch their Sexy Jutsu?

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.100
Sorry about that.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.970
But it seems Sai has begun to lose the Foundation's trust.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.630
Oh...

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.430
Look at the difference in our sexiness!

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:40.970
Now then...

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.000
Damn it! I lose!

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:50.470
I'm supposed to be your rival, but you keep on kicking my butt, Bro!

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.570
I heard the news.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.430
Huh?

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.430
You brought down one of the Pains with your Rasengan, right?

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.600
I was just desperate that time.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.100
Good job, Konohamaru!

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.730
You're a hero in our village too!

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.100
You pick things up quicker than I do!

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.730
Next time, I'll teach you how to do the Giant Rasengan!

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.200
Okay!

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.700
My hand hurts!

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.170
What if I get tendonitis from this and it causes my swordsmanship to deteriorate

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.530
and I end up getting hurt in battle?

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:52.300
And despite the frantic efforts of the girls on the Medical Team, I die.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.730
Keep moving your hand, not your tongue, will you?!

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.430
We have to hurry up and consolidate the data on Sasuke and the Akatsuki,

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.000
or we'll be here forever!

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.600
Umm... Could you please keep your voices down?

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.500
M-My apologies.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.830
LEAF ARCHIVES Finished at last!

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.130
Cripes!

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.900
Try to maintain your cool more if you want to call yourselves ninja, got it?!

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.670
We must hurry to Lord Raikage!

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.430
- Gotcha! - Right!

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.630
Sorry, but I'm planting Signal Seeds on you.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.470
I may not look it, but tailing is my specialty.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.170
Now then...

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.470
I should contact Kakashi and Naruto.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.870
I wonder if that Naruto kid is okay.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.370
If you say another word, I'll beat you up!

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.100
It's been bugging you too, eh?

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.030
I told you not to talk!

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.570
Jeez! Your hands move as quick as ever.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.300
Begin tailing.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:20.630
Right!

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.070
INN

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.100
Chojuro...

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.400
Your Great Twin Sword Hiramekarei must have been heavy during the journey.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.470
Are you all right?

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.670
Oh...yes. Although I feel a bit warm.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.670
Let me see.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.200
You do have a slight temperature.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.370
Lady Fifth, you spoil Chojuro too much!

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.970
This is why youth these days get so full of themselves!

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.900
Feeling feverish after a short walk like that!

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.800
In my day...

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.370
Ao...

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.530
We're no longer in the dark ages when we were known as the Blood Mist Village.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.430
The nightmare under the Fourth Mizukage is over.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.130
Please stop harping on about the past.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.900
P-Pardon me, I just...

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.700
Now, let us stop such depressing talk and have some supper instead.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.700
I am looking forward to the meal here.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:31.930
Oops!

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.500
What's for dinner? Something engaging, I hope.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:36.830
ENGAGING Engaging?

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.800
ENGAGEMENT! Engagement!

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.470
You did make arrangements for dinner, didn't you, Chojuro?

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:50.030
Th-There were so many choices, in the end, I couldn't decide.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.300
In the end, it was... Such indecisiveness!

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.030
Youth these days have no ambition in their hearts! Only voids!

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.330
VOID Void?!

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.670
I'm so sorry. I'll get on it right away!

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:13.100
MY ENGAGEMENT IN THE END, IT WAS... VOID?! My engagement... in the end, it was...void?!

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.230
Why, back in my day...

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.000
Shut up, or I'll kill you.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.130
Why?!

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.870
Man, it's getting cold.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.330
The Land of Iron is just a stone's throw away.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.570
Wait, there's something up ahead.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.800
I've never been to the Land of Iron. I'm so excited.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.630
There's nothing special about it.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.030
What's it like, Gramps?

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.370
It lies among three mountains known as the Three Wolves.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:06.500
It has its own culture, its own jurisdiction, a powerful military and maintains neutrality.

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.430
So it has its own culture and power.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.330
What makes it different from the Land of Earth?

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.930
There is a long-standing rule that ninja will not meddle with it.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.130
The Land of Iron does not rely on ninja.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.270
Instead, it is protected by those who are known as samurai.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:34.400
How did it go?

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.270
The security is real tight due to the Five Kage Summit.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.330
Jugo, use animals to scout out the route to the summit

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.900
where the security is the thinnest.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.230
Okay.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.500
We have been awaiting your arrival, Lord Kazekage.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.070
My name is Mifune, a General of this Land of Iron.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.030
It is a pleasure to meet you. I am the Kazekage, Gaara.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
It's cold.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.800
The climate is totally different from the Land of Wind.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.870
Some hot tea will warm you up.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.200
Please come inside.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.470
It's gotten cold all of a sudden.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.800
We're in the middle of tailing! So, shh!

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:32.530
How is it?

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.200
We can go up a route on the west side.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.070
There aren't many guards.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.870
Karin, keep checking the chakra positions of the guards.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.470
We're going to infiltrate now.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.200
I have to come too?!

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.670
This is the time to demonstrate your powers.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.330
Zetsu, was it?

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.730
Yeah?

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.230
I need you to confirm which one is Danzo. You're coming too.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.330
A message from Sai, it seems.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:17.830
What is it?

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.130
Just a routine report.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:22.600
Let's go.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.530
Why can't we just ambush him before he arrives?

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.130
I'm getting tired.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.370
Are you stupid?!

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.870
If the Hokage is late, they're bound to think something went wrong.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.000
Then samurai reinforcements will swarm all over the place.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.230
And what if the other Kage come too?

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.800
We don't know the enemy's strength.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.770
So we should wait for our chance for a surprise attack on his way home.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.570
Right, Sasuke?

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.230
Karin, just focus on the enemy's chakra positions.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.230
Busted.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.370
Shut up!

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.330
Sasuke, it seems you have your hands full.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.700
Never mind that.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.130
I need you to verify which one is Danzo before the meeting.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.570
You better not lie.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.230
I am attuned to chakra.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.800
There's always a disturbance in chakra when one lies.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.470
So just remember, I'll be checking on you all the time.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.570
I won't lie.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.170
Danzo is a hindrance to us too.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.630
Lord Raikage, it's Team Samui.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.430
Let's descend!

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.000
I have returned from the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:41.670
And how did it go?

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.770
Samui, you've been tailed.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.600
Come out, you Hidden Leaf dogs!

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.930
We need to talk!

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.330
Lord Raikage, the incident in which you tried to obtain the Hyuga Byakugan

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.770
is still unresolved on our side.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.570
Please try not to forget the sacrifices made by the Leaf.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.070
Right here and now, this young ninja, no matter how awkwardly,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.770
is bowing his head in his affection for the Cloud and Leaf, village and nation.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:55.030
Lord Raikage... As one of the five Kage, what do you think of this?

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.830
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Naruto's Plea"

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.570
How foolish.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.230
Tune in again!
