WEBVTT

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.860
Era of Warring States

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.400
W-Wait...

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.150
A-Are you sure he's an Uchiha?

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.400
Yes...

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.240
If he's found out that you're Senju,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.940
he'll pretend to let his guard down to steal intel on us.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.610
Do not trust him.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.190
No, he's not like that...

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.190
You'd trust the clan who killed your younger brother?

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.320
You have no idea what he's thinking inside his gut!

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.900
If he tricks you, you'll be putting the entire Senju Clan at risk.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.740
That's not...

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.780
Just in case, Tobirama and I will come along. Understood?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.490
Answer me!

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.440
Yes.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.400
I know it's right off the bat,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.940
but how about we just skip stones instead of exchanging greetings?

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.070
Yeah...

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.280
Hashirama...

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.530
Sorry. I can't stay today...

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.820
I just remembered something I have to do.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.190
O-Oh yeah? I'm going to head home then.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.570
RUN TRAP, SCRAM

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.820
That speed! He's planning to run for it!

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.740
Damn Hashirama! He warned him!

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.530
Let's go, Tobirama!

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.360
Yes!

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.440
Seems like we're both on the same page.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.490
Butsuma Senju.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.530
And Tobirama, I believe.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.990
Indeed, Tajima Uchiha.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.940
And Izuna, right?

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.780
It seemed the Uchiha coincidentally had the same idea.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.530
Exactly the same circumstances.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.110
Butsuma Senju and Tajima Uchiha both knew from numerous prior clashes

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.990
that they possessed practically equal strength.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.740
- Stop! - Stop!

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.400
Shinobi are trained to keep their hearts in check on the battlefield,

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.530
no matter what happens.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.240
A single flash of emotional display can lead to vulnerability

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.610
and mean the difference between life and death.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.070
However...

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.360
The two adults were well aware...

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.780
that if their own child were killed right before their eyes,

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.490
it would likely, no matter how slight, unbalance their heart.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.530
Meaning...

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.360
whoever could land the first strike would determine the outcome.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.780
TRAP, SCRAM              RUN

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.490
I'll never forgive anyone who tries to hurt my little brother,

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.690
no matter who they are!

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.610
Same here!

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.190
Hey, Hashirama...

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.400
What is it?

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.530
Maybe it just isn't possible for us...

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.110
to reach that...

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.740
pipe dream of ours...

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.740
Madara... What are you...?

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.440
It may have been brief, but it was fun...Hashirama.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.940
Three against three...

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.110
Can we take them, Madara?

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.820
No...

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.530
Hashirama is stronger than me.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.070
If we fight, we'll lose.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.070
There's a kid stronger than you, Brother?

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.740
I see, quite impressive.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.860
Let's retreat!

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.490
So long.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.490
Madara!

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.240
You...really haven't given up, have you?

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.570
You've gotten to the same point I... You are Senju.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.940
I truly wish it wasn't so.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.570
My brothers were killed by the Senju.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.070
And your brothers, by the Uchiha...

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.610
So there's no need to show our guts to each other.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.990
Our next meeting will likely be on the battlefield...

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.070
Hashirama Senju.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.610
I'm...Madara Uchiha.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.860
Father! Look at Big Brother's eyes!

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.320
We may not have obtained any intel on the Senju...

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.490
but it seems we gained something valuable from this, after all.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.360
He awakened his Sharingan...just now?

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.440
In that moment,

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.320
I felt like I understood what awakening the Sharingan truly signified.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.360
He decided to completely erase his friend.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.570
To erase me from his life.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.400
After that, we battled. We fought each other day after day.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.740
And before we knew it,

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.280
we'd each become our respective clan's leaders.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.650
We were at the furthest place possible...

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.940
from the dream that we wanted to fulfill.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.780
Fire Style!

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.190
Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.070
Water Style! Water Dragon Missile!

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.780
A blind attack...

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.150
I curse the misfortune of the ones who do not have the Sharingan.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:09.780
Flying Raijin Slice!

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:16.820
Izuna!

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.320
Hang in there!

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.440
I swear I'll save you!

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.900
Hashirama...

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.780
Madara... You cannot defeat me.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.530
But I had never abandoned our dream.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.400
Why don't we end this?

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.610
If the two strongest shinobi clans, the Uchiha and Senju, join forces,

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.440
nations will not be able to find

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.570
other shinobi clans that can stand against us...

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.610
The conflict will eventually start to die down.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.400
Come on.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.990
No... Big Brother...

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.440
Izuna!

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.190
Do not be deceived by them...

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.360
Izuna!

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.360
Have you forgotten that these bastards killed everyone...

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.400
killed the Uchiha?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.530
It was clear to all that the Uchiha Clan was in an unfavorable position.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.530
In fact, defectors to the Senju soon began showing up.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.440
And that's about when Madara changed as well.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.240
He had obtained the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.170
Those eyes...

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.460
What happened to Izuna?

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.130
My little brother ended up dying from that day's wounds...

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.460
Leaving me powers that will help protect the Uchiha!

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.670
I sent you a cease-fire agreement!

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.830
If you truly want to protect the Uchiha, let's stop fighting!

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.540
Hashirama!

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.130
Wood Style, Deep Forest Bloom!

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.380
Poison Pollen eh?

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.210
Enough, Madara!

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.000
Fighting is meaningless!

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.250
Meaningless?

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.330
Then why did Izuna die?

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.500
It's because.... because you bastards killed him!

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.630
Wood Golem Jutsu!

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.790
Hashirama!

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.830
Madara, we were friends!

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.830
And we shared the same dream!

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.380
Hashirama!

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.290
How long will you keep saying such juvenile things?

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.250
It's just not possible to show our guts to each other!

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.420
Don't you get it?

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.460
Hashirama!

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.250
Madara!

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.250
At the end of a battle that lasted a whole day...

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.290
Madara's back touched the ground for the very first time.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.630
Madara...

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.130
You're finished.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.790
Wait, Tobirama.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.880
Why, Elder Brother?!

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.580
This is our chance!

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.330
No one touches him!

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.790
Just get it over with, Hashirama.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.380
It would be an honor to die by your hand.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.710
Stop posturing.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.170
If I kill the clan leader of the Uchiha,

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.460
it will only incite the young ones who follow you.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.790
There isn't anyone left with such pluck among the Uchiha anymore.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.750
Sure there are.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.290
Perhaps not right now, but in time.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.380
Come on... Why don't we end this war?

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.420
We made a promise, remember?

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.210
To create the ideal village someday.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.960
Can't we go back to those days... and skip rocks together?

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.040
That's just impossible.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.830
You and I are no longer the same.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.130
Let's build our settlement here!

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.500
Heh... You're pretty much the only one spouting such nonsense.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.420
Well then, what about you?

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.130
Yeah... If that settlement gets built here,

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.250
then I could watch over my little brother,

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.750
and protect him in this place where you can see to no end!

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:18.210
I don't have a single brother left.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.710
I have nothing to protect.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.920
And...I just can't trust you.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.420
Is there any way I can convince you to trust us?

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.830
Well, there is a way to show each other our guts...

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.000
Either kill your brother...

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.880
or kill yourself right now.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.330
And then we'll be even. I'd be willing to trust your clan.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.380
Kill your little brother or kill yourself?

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.080
How dare you say something so ridicu-

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:56.960
I agree.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.750
This is crazy!

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.460
So what are you going to do, Elder Brother?

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.630
Are you going to kill me now?

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.130
Or are you going to die on account of this guy's nonsense?

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.380
It's idiotic. Don't listen to him!

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.580
Thank you, Madara.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.630
You really are kindhearted.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.250
Madara had given me a choice,

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.500
an option where I wouldn't have to kill my little brother.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.460
He knew all too well...

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.000
how an older brother feels towards his younger siblings.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.290
Listen, Tobirama...

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.380
Etch these words into your heart, for these are my final words...

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.710
Brother...

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.420
Words that I shall be exchanging with my life.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.880
You too, my fellow clan members.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.170
After my death, do not kill Madara.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.750
I forbid any fighting between the Uchiha and Senju.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.540
Swear this right now...

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.500
upon the lives of your fathers, and your grandchildren yet unborn.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.330
Farewell...

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.130
Enough...

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.330
I have now seen your guts.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.460
It was like a dream...

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.000
The Uchiha and the Senju formed an alliance.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.380
There would no longer be any casualties,

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.250
nor would any more children have to die.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:21:00.290
And so, we began building our village.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.430
Do you remember how we used to talk here when we were brats?

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.430
Yeah... I thought we were just talking about our dream.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.140
That dream is now becoming a reality.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.430
There's no time to be weak right now!

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.350
We're going to need to come up with a name for the village too!

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.810
Any thoughts?

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.390
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "My True Dream"

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.060
How about the Village Hidden in the Leaves?

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:08.560
