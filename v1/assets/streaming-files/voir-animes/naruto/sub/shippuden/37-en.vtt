00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.230
Could it be?

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.230
Sakura, you've got it all wrong.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.730
I'm not peeking!

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
Naruto!

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.000
And here I told you not to... not to...not to...

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.000
Oww!

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.630
Forgive me...Sakura.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.100
Sakura...!

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.800
Is it morning already...?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.900
I don't...feel like I slept at all...

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.770
Did he get up already...?

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.730
His stuff...

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.070
Sai's stuff is gone...

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.370
Where...did he go?!

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.200
Morning, Naruto.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.130
C-Captain Yamato...

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.700
That jerk, that jerk Sai... Sai's outside.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.370
Your timing's perfect. I've got something I want to ask you to do for me...

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.900
Untitled 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.300
Wow...

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.300
So you draw.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.000
Is there something you want?

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.870
You're foul-mouthed, but you've also got a sensitive side, huh?

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.000
That's a surprise.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.870
That fake smile... So you're still not through hitting me, huh?

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.870
Not quite...

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.570
I'm kidding! I just came to check out your picture.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.400
I was wondering what you were drawing.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.070
I see...

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.100
At first, I thought you were drawing a landscape

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.570
since you're drawing out here...

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.900
But it's an abstract, huh?

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.270
What's the title of this drawing?

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.030
You haven't decided on one yet?

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.830
I don't know.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.600
You don't know...?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.230
The name of this drawing, a title.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.370
You've got something in mind, don't you?

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.530
I won't laugh, so tell me.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.700
I've got nothing like that.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.830
What?!

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.670
I've drawn tens of thousands of pictures...

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.630
but I've never given one a title.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.700
So this doesn't have one, either...

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.070
Really?

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.070
But you're supposed to give a title to a picture, right?

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.970
If it's a portrait, you give it the name of the person...

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.670
Or with other pictures,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.600
you use the situation, your feelings or emotions at the time...

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.430
To be exact, I couldn't title one of my drawings even if I wanted to...

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.130
Nothing comes to mind. I don't...feel anything.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.270
Nothing...

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.900
No wonder you can only say such callous things!

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.330
It's about time for us to leave!

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.270
Captain Yamato told me to come get you.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.370
Right.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.100
This drawing's nothing special!

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.230
You're right... Just like your "equipment."

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.530
I'm going to be straight with you!

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.000
I can't stand you!

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.430
If you've got a problem,

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.270
stop the fake smiles and tell me straight to my face!

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.800
I'll take you on anytime you want to fight!

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.000
Oh... You want to fight?!

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.770
I've got...

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.030
no problem with you.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.430
I don't care about you at all.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.800
Please go on ahead.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.130
I'll catch up once I've tidied up.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.600
I'll help.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.430
This...isn't printed.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.730
Did you draw this, too?

00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.970
Yes.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.170
Wow, it's a picture book, huh?

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.430
That looks cool.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.270
Oh! Say...

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.000
can I take a look at it along the way?

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.800
I can't let you see it.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.900
It's not finished yet...

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.730
And I don't hand this over to people.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.730
This is my older brother's book, so...

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.570
But he said he drew it himself...

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.330
What's he talking about?

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.270
Thank you... Please come again...

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.230
So has your rapport improved?

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.170
Why do we have to be with this guy?

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.270
So would you have preferred control by fear?

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.170
I-It's okay. Our rapport has improved!

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.970
Naruto looks like he's enjoying himself...

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.900
What're you talking about?

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.100
That's a fake smile any way you look at it.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.370
Really?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.470
You yourself said that a smile is the best way

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.970
to get through a tough situation, right?

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.630
Oh yeah.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:07.300
I don't feel anything. I don't care about you at all.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.230
It's just about time.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.200
What is it, Captain Yamato?

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.930
This way.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.130
Huh?

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.870
Hurry up!

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.430
O-Okay!

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.270
Why are we going to the trouble of coming through here...?

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.530
Captain Yamato! What's the meaning of this?!

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.270
I think the path we were on was the right way.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:28.300
Captain!

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.930
I'm sure Lady Tsunade has told you.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.370
What're you talking about?

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.700
The information Sakura got might be a trap.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.000
There's a possibility that the Akatsuki might be...

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.130
waiting to ambush us at the Tenchi Bridge.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.730
They might be after you, Naruto.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.400
No way...

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.400
I don't think there's a great possibility,

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.670
but you can never be too careful.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.900
We'll proceed along a covert route as much as possible

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.230
until we reach the Tenchi Bridge.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.530
Right, got it.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.170
I guess this spot is okay.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.400
Huh?

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.600
Don't tell me...

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.970
We'll rest here tonight.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.270
What?!

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.870
If we're going to camp out,

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.870
we should use the cave we just passed by instead of this wide open area...

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.370
Step back, everyone.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.080
Wood Style: Four Pillar House Jutsu!

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.010
We'll camp out here tonight.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.950
I don't think you can call something like this camping out.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.580
This is amazing...

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.650
Wow, so this is what it looks like on the inside.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.310
It's quite spacious, isn't it?

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.610
I think our room just might hold some promise.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.250
Welcome Team Kakashi Over there...

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.950
Huh?

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.650
It's surprisingly bare, isn't it?

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.780
W-Well, it's better than sleeping outside.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.780
You're right.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.450
Break time, break time!

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.580
Now if only we had a bath, too.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.180
Is there something you want?

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.810
Nothing at all!

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.380
Gather around, everyone.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.750
And I want to ask you something, Sakura.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.110
What is it?

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.280
It's about the Akatsuki's Sasori.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:49.680
Sasori...

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.310
I wanted to ask you sooner,

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.780
but I promised that we weren't going to talk about stuff like that yesterday.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.650
I want you to tell me everything today...

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.010
You're the only one who's ever seen Sasori in person, after all...

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.310
Yes, sir.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.710
For the time being,

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.710
I've received a file on Sasori from the Hidden Sand...

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.410
But tell me in as much detail as you can

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.350
about his personality, behavior, mannerisms and habits if he has any.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.950
What's this about?

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.450
The spy who's infiltrated Orochimaru's organization thinks

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.680
Sasori is going to meet him at the Tenchi Bridge.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.480
They might see us through immediately,

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.380
but it's probably best to approach by transforming into Sasori.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.050
If Sasori doesn't show up at the Tenchi Bridge,

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.210
then the spy might not, either...

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.280
There's a distinct possibility.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.110
Then there'd be no point.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.180
Being a spy is a very risky act, after all.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.910
Which means the spy is probably being quite cautious.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.950
Then are you going to transform into Sasori, Captain Yamato?

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.750
I'll probably have to.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:17.180
It seems he always remained hidden inside this Hiruko puppet.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.450
So I'm probably the right one for this since I can use the Wood Style Ninjutsu.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.580
You're right.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.150
And also, assuming this turns out to be an Akatsuki trap...

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.210
I'll approach him alone at first.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.110
At midday in ten days, go to the Tenchi Bridge

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.110
located in the Village Hidden in the Grass!

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.150
What do you mean?

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.050
I've got a spy working as one of Orochimaru's subordinates...

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:52.110
I was supposed to rendezvous... with him...there...

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.910
The way he talked being near death...

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.580
I don't think he was lying...

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.450
And there was indeed a spy called Yura in the Sand Village...

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.280
This is just assuming something goes wrong.

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.010
You guys stand by until I give you instructions.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.510
Either way, there's no doubting...

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.410
that spy is probably considerably powerful.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.050
Let's do this!

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.250
Now then...

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.350
Now for the main issue...

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.280
Let me explain the mission in a little more detail.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.550
Our goal is just to arrest the target.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:37.410
We must not let him die, even if we end up having to fight.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.480
We'll lose an important source of information if the target is killed.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.610
And a mission like this is more difficult than just killing an enemy.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.750
As this is a delicate mission, I will make the first move.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.350
And you guys will be my back-up...

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.450
The strategy is simple. First, I restrain the target.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.310
Second, if I should fail to restrain the target

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.550
and this turns into a battle,

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.380
you guys shift to battle formation.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.910
I will give you a signal when I want you to do this.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.410
And in the event of the second case,

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.850
you are to operate with the Buddy System.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.150
B-Buddy System?

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.980
When one person takes action, a partner always backs you up.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.180
Reciprocal back-up is a fundamental rule.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:28.480
You know about this, don't you?

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.410
Oh, yeah! That, huh?

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.780
Get it together, will you?

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.910
Now I'm going to determine the Buddy Teams.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.150
First, Sakura and I will be one team!

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:42.450
And...

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.450
the other team will be... Naruto and Sai!

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.980
Me...?

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.450
with him...?

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.110
You jerk! Don't you know what the word comrade is?

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.680
Of course! I could explain it to you if you like.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.010
That's not what I mean!

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.580
Please don't blame your lack of individual competence on others.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:49.450
What?!

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.280
It isn't ideal to fight while protecting someone

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.550
who has lost his cool.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.810
All I did was consider the best way to successfully complete the mission,

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.110
make a judgment and take action.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.210
I'll never acknowledge you!

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.410
I wonder what Sasuke would've done.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.450
