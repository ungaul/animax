WEBVTT

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.940
Will you bump fists with me?

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.940
Yeah.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.570
Yeah, let's try it!

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.110
There's nothing we can't do if we borrow Nine Tails'...

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.230
I mean, Kurama's power.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.280
All right!

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.900
Then let's all four of us join forces!

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.730
All four of us, eh?

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.110
You treat us like we're human too.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.570
What kind of childrearing has led to this, eh?

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.480
Naruto...

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.690
Huh?

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.070
I wish there was more time to talk to the grown-up you!

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.820
Guys don't need to talk!

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.530
I already know!

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.820
I...already met Mom's chakra...

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.730
What you want to say is the same as my nagging mom, right?!

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.730
I already know!

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.220
This feeling is so familiar...

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.030
Even though we're out of options,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.830
it feels like we can accomplish anything...

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.620
That's right! It's just like when I was with Kushina!

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.990
I feel power welling up inside me!

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.780
Let's go!

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.410
Naruto's got this much chakra?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.780
Naruto! Letting out a shout and showing off

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.740
is all well and good...

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.870
but don't tell me you've already forgotten...

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.950
that nothing other than Sage Jutsu works against him?

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.910
I know you're not an idiot!

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.530
That's right!

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.530
You're a bigger idiot than my elder brother!

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.660
All that chakra and it's being wasted on him...

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.030
Or perhaps this isn't quite the same feeling...

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.330
It looks like you've surpassed all the previous Hokage, in stupidity!

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.200
Shut up! Stupid, stupid Kurama!

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.910
Fools are easily liked and trusted by others.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.530
It'll be all right. Don't worry about it.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.330
I-I'm not worried that I'm an idiot!

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.330
I'm not talking about that.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.200
Huh?

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.660
I'm saying that you might be able to go into Sage Mode

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.740
while you're in that state.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.740
Listen up... You've probably already forgotten,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.080
but during your final battle with Pain, Nagato...

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.830
I got so mad by what he was saying that my chakra leaked out,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.660
even though you were in Sage Mode at that time.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.660
My power and your Sage Power actually managed to synchronize.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.370
Did something like that happen back then...?

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.700
You say that, but back when I was undergoing Sage Training,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.740
you interfered with Gramps Sage's Sage Jutsu, remember?

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.870
That's because I had no interest in sharing the same space with toads!

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.830
Besides, it really pissed me off that you would rely on Sage Jutsu

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.620
when you had my chakra.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.370
You stubborn bastard!

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.740
You're the stubborn one!

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.830
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is,

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.620
that I'm willing to let you use

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.950
both my power and Sage Power right now.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.870
What's stubborn about that, damn it?!

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.740
You just can't be up front about your feelings, can you?

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.410
You bastard! You've been making fun of me a lot lately!

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.330
It's not like that... It's out of familiarity...

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.910
Using Tailed Beast State with Sage Jutsu at the same time, huh...

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.280
You've got the same me inside you as your son.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.700
You should be able to provide him with powerful support.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.990
Yeah...

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.780
I already know that!

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.240
I'll have some jutsu prepared too!

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.200
I'm absorbing Nature Energy a lot faster in this state.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.450
All right!

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.840
The Divine Tree

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.210
Naruto, add Sage Jutsu to the Rasengan!

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.420
Okay!

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.670
Old Man Second!

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.340
Let's do it!

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.290
Just forge ahead!

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.290
We'll ward off his attacks with our chakra!

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.750
– Rasengan! – Rasengan!

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.590
That black thing sure is solid!

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.380
Damn it... He blocked us this time!

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.000
He predicted our attack...

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.210
Using only the Flying Raijin in our strategy isn't enough.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.290
Our only option is to destroy that black thing!

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.880
But how?

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.960
All right, next up...

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.290
Let's try adding Sage Jutsu to a Tailed Beast Bomb!

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.670
All right, excellent idea!

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.170
You might just surpass my Elder Brother as Hokage...

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.170
Hey, other Kurama! You help too!

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.290
I like the sound of that!

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.380
I thought so...

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.290
This is a familiar feeling, after all!

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.960
This is what Naruto is capable of now?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.380
He's able to control this much chakra perfectly...

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.590
How far will you...

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.710
There's no harm in taking measures early.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.380
W-What's that?!

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.880
He's starting the Infinite Tsukuyomi already?!

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.420
He spit out the Ten Tails?

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.090
Be careful. I have a bad feeling about this.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.500
I'll suspend the barrier for now.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.250
The barrier is disappearing!

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.750
Now we can fight alongside Naruto and the others!

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.290
Th-This is—!

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.750
What?!

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.540
Run! It will absorb all your chakra in one swoop!

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.380
It's coming after us one by one!

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.250
But why...?!

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:53.420
Why...?! Why do I get so many coming at me, huh?

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.460
Fool... Ya fool!

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.210
This is the tree of God. It's called the Divine Tree!

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.460
It's the Ten Tails' final form!

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.380
It knows that you have more chakra than everyone else!

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:11.290
At this rate, the chakra that Naruto gave to everyone is meaningless.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.840
W-What is this?!

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.040
Chakra first originated with...

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.920
this Divine Tree!

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.250
All the chakra here...

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.210
Even the enormous amounts of chakra you possess.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.420
What?

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.880
Humans stole chakra from the Divine Tree long ago.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.460
It's just trying to take back what belongs to it.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.250
What are you talking about?!

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.920
The endless passing of time has cast a fog over the truth.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.170
Do you know how shinobi came to be, Hashirama?

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:57.500
Long ago, when people didn't even have a concept of chakra...

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.960
...even then, people still battled each other.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.210
The Divine Tree was never involved in their battles

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:14.290
and was worshipped as a sacred pillar.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.040
But one day...

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.090
The Divine Tree bore a fruit that was said to be produced

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.630
only once in a millennium.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.960
I don't know what it signified, but legend dictated

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.750
that no one was to ever lay hands on the fruit.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.250
But one princess, in her desire

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.290
to reap the power of the Divine Tree to win a war,

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.630
took and consumed the forbidden fruit.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.920
Afterwards, she gained the power of a god,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.040
and it was said she quashed the war by herself.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.460
Her name was Kaguya Otsutsuki.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.290
So that's how!

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.460
She was the first human to have chakra.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.040
Eventually, Kaguya would bear a child

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.790
who was born with chakra already within him.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.460
However, the Divine Tree came alive

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.590
and went on a rampage in order to reclaim its stolen chakra.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.170
That is the Ten Tails.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.420
And the one who stopped it was Kaguya's child.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.590
His name was Hagoromo Otsutsuki.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.920
He was the one who preached the teachings of chakra,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.960
and was the founder of Ninshu.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.920
He was the forefather of the shinobi—

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.960
the man known as the Sage of Six Paths.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.130
How do you know all of this?!

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.210
It was inscribed on the Uchiha Stone Tablet.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.290
Do I need to explain what happened

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.340
to those who tasted of the forbidden fruit...

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.670
for the purpose of ending all conflict?

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.380
That's right... It didn't change anything.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.040
In fact, subsequent wars become more gruesome!

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.420
Upon learning this, I fell into despair.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.460
There are no such things as true dreams in this world, Hashirama!

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.590
Ever since people tasted that fruit, humans have been cursed...

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.630
And destined to hate each other even more!

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.250
And it is we shinobi whose very existence

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.420
symbolizes that foolishness, don't you think?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.170
In which case I'd rather...

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.340
So relying on the power of the Divine Tree again

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.090
by using a great genjutsu...

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.710
You just can't see it...

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:54.000
What's beyond this... The dreams of the far future.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.250
Is this what you meant by "dreams of the far future"?!

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.340
Yes...

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But it will be a little different.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.630
Naruto!

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.040
Water Style: Severing Wave!

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.040
Damn it! There are too many of them!

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.090
I might be able to sense Naruto, but it's useless!

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.670
Fourth! Can you teleport directly to Naruto?!

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:40.380
I can't! That last Flying Raijin and these vines have drained my chakra!

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.670
In that case...

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.210
Let go...of me...

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.880
Gramps...

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.420
Sorry it took so long!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.710
Oh!

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.790
Saru!

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.290
All right!

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.880
We're teleporting out of here!

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.420
Have things finally settled down?

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.920
Is this what you meant by "dreams of the far future"?!

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.420
Yes...

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.210
But it will be a little different.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.460
"A little different"?

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.290
Take a look...

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.960
When the Divine Tree's bud finally blooms...

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.290
The moon will reflect the eye at the flower's center, up above...

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.920
and the Infinite Tsukuyomi will be fully activated...

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:57.210
And I...will be the one to accomplish it.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.960
We're doomed!

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.000
This is crazy...

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.590
Miss Sakura!

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.750
Are you all right, Miss Sakura?

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.040
That was a close call, fool! Ya fool!

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.460
That was too close!

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.710
Is it over?

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:46.000
Now, be still...

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.340
You have all...

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.340
endured plenty already.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.170
Shinobi are done for.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.090
There's no need to keep going.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.670
If you don't resist, I won't kill you.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.790
Unless you want to be filled with regret,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.710
stop and do nothing from here on out.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.090
You don't have to fear death or keep enduring anymore.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.040
You'll be entering a dream.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.420
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "A Shinobi's Dream"

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.630

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:08.540
