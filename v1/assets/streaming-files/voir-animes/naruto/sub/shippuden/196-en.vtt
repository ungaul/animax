WEBVTT

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.440
What did I tell you, idiot?!

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.610
It's because you're way too old for this!

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.480
Oww…

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.440
Thanks, Kazekage!

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.440
An Eye of Sand…

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.820
So he used that to keep an eye on Ohnoki all this time!

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.820
When he got the Giant Clam,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.860
he switched out with a Sand Clone, eh?

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.190
Oww…

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.610
This one's gonna be big…

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.980
And he doesn't have eyebrows.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.860
Okay! We got him!

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.610
No, it didn't work!

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.940
The slime is making the Sand not stick together!

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.320
This is bad! I'm starting to enjoy this fight!

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.610
Grand Sand Mausoleum!

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.190
Now! Throw every Sealing Tag you've got!

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.030
There's no way his slime can keep up with this much Sand.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.530
Attach the Sealing Chains!

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.320
SEAL

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.320
Good! We have this one!

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.030
Wha—?!

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.150
Th-This can't be…!

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.900
What the hell is that?!

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.570
Is it another genjutsu?

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.570
Is it a genjutsu?

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.730
No… It's not a genjutsu!

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.530
That gave my predecessor Lord Mu some trouble!

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.860
It's the Infinite Explosion Ninjutsu of the Mizukage!

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.320
The Steam Imp!

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.980
Terror: The Steam Imp

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.610
Hail?

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.900
Air forced upwards by the steam explosion gets cooled

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.860
in the upper atmosphere and turns into hail!

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.940
It shrank!

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.190
What's this?

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.190
He's a clone made from oil and water

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.320
taken from inside the Mizukage's body.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.150
WATER OIL The exterior surface of its child-like form is composed of oil,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.070
WATER OIL while its interior is just water.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.400
WATER OIL Its special feature is that it can both heat up and cool down easily.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.440
When it moves around,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.480
STEAM OIL WATER the oil on its surface heats up precipitously,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.150
STEAM OIL WATER causing rapid vaporization of the water inside,

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.400
resulting in an explosion of steam!

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.480
And when the hail cools it,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.280
it shrinks back down to its original size and it is ready to explode again.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.530
It's coming!

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.150
He's faster than I expected!

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.190
Are you all right?!

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.530
Damn it! This clone's a wily one!

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.690
The real one should be around here somewhere!

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.940
Don't bother with the clone. Look for the original!

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.980
Another feature of this jutsu is that

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.530
it greatly weakens the caster while they are using it!

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.190
That brat, Ohnoki, sure knows a lot!

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.480
Mu must've told him.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.730
If it's not a Mirage Genjutsu, and he can't make himself disappear…

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.030
I should be able to sense him.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.480
The original is behind that rock!

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.440
Damn, my back! Of all times for it to go out!

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.170
Oww…

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.480
Oh! Found me?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.110
Before the hail stops…

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.610
I will seal you!

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.400
What's going on with him?

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.570
He's getting bigger and bigger!

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.820
It's like Lord Tsuchikage said.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.860
The more it moves,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.190
the faster the water heats up and vaporizes.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.860
The hail has stopped too.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.570
There's going to be another explosion of steam soon!

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.860
We've trapped the original!

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.190
SEAL

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.400
Hey!
Damn!

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.110
Whoa…

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.400
This is a perfect hiding place!

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.530
I was once one of the Five Kage too.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.320
As long as I have my oil, your Sand is useless.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.360
Unless, of course, you seal me real fast.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.610
Seems like it!

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.150
Now!

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.190
How are you going to take me down?!

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.030
I was hoping you'd tell us.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.440
I'm done doing that.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.820
Sorry.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.320
You were cooperative until just now! What happened?

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.730
Have you decided to side with the enemy?

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.570
You're wrong.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.480
I am a former Kage, after all.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.780
I am helping you out… just in a different way.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.190
Which is what exactly?

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.900
If you can't win against me using all of your abilities,

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.150
that means you're less than dead old me, you fool!

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.570
How are you gonna win against the enemy boss like that?!

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.150
I think he's about to explode!

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.650
Retreat!

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.360
Just when I thought I'd found the Golden Child of the Five Kage…

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.070
Kazekage! You're just an ordinary kid, after all!

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.860
Over there!

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.440
Hold on! I'm coming!

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.730
This is…the Sand Shield?!

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.860
Lord Kazekage protected us!

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.150
But where's Lord Gaara?!

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.320
You protected everyone and attacked at the same time,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.150
knowing full well you'd sustain damage!

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.570
Unless you stop this guy,

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.860
the same thing is going to keep happening!

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.230
The hail has stopped… Let's see what you've got!

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.900
You mistimed getting your shield up because of its sudden expansion!

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.150
Another Sand Clone?

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.480
That's within expectations…

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.320
I knew it. The real one was hiding below!

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.400
What're you going to do? It's going to explode again!

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.320
You'll never catch him with the speed of your Sand.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.780
What're you… Huh?

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.190
What's happening?

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.610
Did he increase the speed of his Sand?

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.440
Either way… Ka-boom!

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.030
More smoke!

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.780
They've got to be there!

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.570
It stopped moving!

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.530
Is that…?

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.230
Gold!

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.400
Did he mix that Gold Dust his father left behind

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.070
and do something to it?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.610
I hid Gold Dust in that Sand Clone earlier.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.690
I took advantage of that thing's heat

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.900
to melt the gold and bond it to him.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.440
Gold is about 20 times heavier than water.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.070
Which is why its movements have slowed down.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.730
That's why it was so easy to trap it with the Sand!

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.610
Still, why didn't it explode?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.570
Sand mixed with the hail was more than enough to cool him down.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:21.440
Gold also has good conductivity, which helped chill its steam.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.860
Well played. Truly befitting a current Kage!

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.690
I'm impressed that you came up with such a strategy!

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400
Wait a minute…

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.650
You really are…

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.570
the Golden Child, after all!

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.280
I never expected to be at such a disadvantage.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.070
Still, I'm glad that clone was sealed before he could say too much.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.570
Given Naruto and his power…

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:12.110
Even if it's a Reanimated body, it will take some time to regenerate.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.150
How naïve, Ohnoki… You were my student.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.570
How could you miss that I had fragmented myself?

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.530
This is…

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.900
a violently rotating… Rasengan!

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.820
Earth Style! Boulder Jutsu!

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.650
Be careful, I'm…

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.190
All right!

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.400
SEAL SEAL As I thought, I can't get this tag off.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.650
It's an impressive Sealing Jutsu.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.940
If I remember correctly,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.400
Mu's jutsu is not cloning, but fission.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.610
Because the real body simply splits into two,

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.900
he doesn't need to make signs and it's faster.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.440
However, his power is halved.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.190
Summoning him will take time in this one's weakened state.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.320
I must buy time with another tactic…

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.320
Are you all right, Gaara?!

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.230
What about you?

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.940
We sealed the Raikage!

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.570
I saw an explosion,

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.650
so I rushed here ahead of Temari and the others.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.280
I see!

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.230
I'm almost done here too.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.400
So, where's your enemy?

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.610
Hey, so you have a friend!

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.030
Huh?

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.400
W-What is this guy?!

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.400
Man, what a weird body!

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.860
No, that's my jutsu.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.610
Kazekage… Unlike you, he seems like an idiot!

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.030
You make a good pair.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.400
Really?

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.030
It's been a while since I had this much fun!

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:17.820
SEAL

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.530
Relay our current battle status to HQ!

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:41.610
Yes, sir!

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.690
You fought well against the former Kage, everyone!

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.070
Victory is ours for this battle!

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.530
All right!

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.030
Extract the injured and transport them to the Medical Corps!

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.780
Those who can still fight will stand by for orders from HQ!

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.690
Lord Tsuchikage, you should go to the Medical Corps, too.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.610
I'm fine now.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.480
Owww… Don't overdo it, old man.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:07.570
Don't treat me like an old man!

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.820
I can still take you young ones on—

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.320
Okay, come on.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.530
Let us take you to the Medical Corps.

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.440
Fool! Let me go!

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.360
I can walk on my own!

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.610
You should just admit that you're old.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.440
How dare you! I am the Tsuchikage!

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.400
Yes, I heard that yesterday too.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.480
Lord Gaara, please come by later.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.400
Let go, I said! Didn't you hear me?

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.230
We're going this way!

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.610
Owww!

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.530
Please stop moving around! We're going.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.070
Naruto, you're a clone, right?

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.780
Yeah… Then where's your original now?

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.110
We are not taking in any more patients.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.570
We just received orders

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.230
to focus on the wounded we have here already.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.440
But they keep bringing in wounded from the battlefront.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.360
There's no way for us to distinguish

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.820
who is an ally and who is the enemy in disguise.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.440
But that's…

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.610
Even our chakra is being copied perfectly.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.480
I might as well just consider everyone besides me the enemy.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.900
Man, what a drag!

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.570
But we have to figure something out.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.610
Where did they hide the Bashosen anyway?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.440
It would be so handy!

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.190
Any sign of the White Zetsu?

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:49.400
No. But he could be disguised as anyone.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.440
Please be careful, Lady Hinata.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.150
Yes… You as well, Neji.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.030
It still blurs…

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.570
The Sealing Corps just reported in.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.360
They failed to seal Pakura and Gari.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.190
I see…

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:34.360
Two remain from the Seven Ninja Swordsmen…

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.400
Fuguki Suikazan and Mangetsu Hozuki.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.820
Everyone, wait for me!

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.440
We get to play with you again!

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.360
We aren't just simple Reanimations, you know.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.400
Our Curse Mark's power has been intensified

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.070
to a level more than when we were alive!

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.070
You strategy-loving idiot!

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.190
Tayuya, girls should speak properly.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:55.480
Shut up, fatso!

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.440
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Ghosts from the Past"

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.440
It's game over for you!

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:09.360
GHOSTS FROM THE PAST Tune in again!
