WEBVTT

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.000
Hey, he's still down.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.400
Naruto!

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.730
Naruto, are you all right?

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.530
Okay, Choji keep him still like that.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.930
Right now, I can only give emergency first-aid.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.070
But, who would've guessed...

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.700
that the original was hidden among the clones.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.670
You're not up to Shikamaru's level...

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.900
but I guess you're pretty smart, Naruto.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.400
Don't compare me with Shikamaru...

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.370
But I'm impressed that

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.830
you were able to fire off your new Jutsu three times.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.200
Even during training, two was the limit.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.400
His quick thinking in making his next move after failing only once...

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.400
His unshakable confidence...

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.430
Naruto has truly become strong.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.630
Perfecting, to this level,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.470
the Jutsu that even the Fourth Hokage could not master...

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.030
Looks like it's time to put our trust in the next generation.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200
He's surpassed me...

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.070
Do you feel it?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.130
You're the one Naruto always envisions before him.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.930
You are making him steadily stronger...

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.130
Isn't that so, Sasuke?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.770
Sir, we should get going...

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.200
Yeah...

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.470
Can you move?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.100
All right, everyone.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.200
Let's go back to the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.830
Where's Kakashi Sensei?

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.470
Tying up loose ends...

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.630
How could I lose... to young brats like you...?

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.400
Well, you're someone who's fought against the First Hokage...

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.000
so we may seem like kids to you.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.330
But to us, you're just a washed-up old man.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.600
That's why you're near death and groveling at our feet.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.630
One after another, a new generation will succeed us.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.630
Good work, everyone.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.430
The immediate danger has passed, but the Akatsuki still remain...

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.870
Do not let down your guard.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.300
Naruto, those wounds are...?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.230
Yeah, my badge of honor.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.770
We did some emergency treatment...

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.100
Just in case, get it checked thoroughly at the Leaf Hospital.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.870
Nah, I don't need... Yes, you do!

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.100
Don't worry, Master.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.530
I'll take full responsibility and take him there.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.270
- Got it, Naruto? - Yes!

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.930
All right then, I order you to take a few days off.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.530
Rest your minds and your bodies.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.800
Dismissed!

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.530
Did you notice?

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.700
Yes.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.970
You mean about Naruto's wound?

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.700
I wonder what it could be?

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.030
I've never seen anything like it...

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.330
What happened to the Akatsuki corpse that Kakashi brought back?

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.570
Well, it's already been sent to the coroner.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.530
Then send a message to whoever's in charge.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.430
Make it a top priority and put a rush on it.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.330
It's finally over...

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.300
Uh-huh.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.600
Sorry.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.730
Huh?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.830
I'll part with you guys here.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.570
But your house is this way...

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.000
I have something to do...

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.430
What is it?

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.970
Now now.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.000
Asuma Sarutobi

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.470
Is it okay to be up and about?

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.270
Shikamaru!

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.870
Your shogi partner is gone...

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.870
You were Asuma's favorite,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.800
so it will be lonely for you...

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:37.730
From precious things to silly things... he taught me so much.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.500
Shogi was one of them.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.400
I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel lonely.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.770
But I'm no longer allowed to act like a little kid ...

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.100
I can't keep crying.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.830
I always complain about what a bother things are,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.570
and because of that, I messed up a lot as a kid.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.970
And each time, Asuma was there to protect me...

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.070
Maybe that's why...

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.470
although he was such an evasive and odd teacher...

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.600
To me, he was a super cool grown-up.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.930
And that's why... this time it's my turn.

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.000
When that child is born,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.130
it'll be my turn to be a protective teacher...

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.430
So I've gotta become a cool grown-up too.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.070
Thank you...

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.600
Boy, Pops. Unlike Asuma, you're good...

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.230
...A Climbing Silver attack, eh?

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.200
What you'd call a necessary sacrifice

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.530
to protect the King against a higher opponent.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.600
If you escape there, then a knight will come here.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.600
So whichever the pawn runs to, your bishop will be supported...

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.300
Sheesh, that knight sure is a nasty move there...

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.700
Well, if you're to compare a Hidden Leaf Ninja to shogi pieces,

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.000
I'm a knight.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.470
What does that mean?

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.600
Asuma said so.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.900
I guess Asuma knew your personality very well.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.200
Then, who would be the King?

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.630
Then do you know who the King is?

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.270
Isn't it the Hokage?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.870
Until recently, I thought so too... But it wasn't...

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.900
Then, who is it?

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.030
When the time comes, you'll realize it too.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.470
The children who will be taking over the future Hidden Leaf Village...

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.130
They are the King.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.070
You know what it's all about.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.030
All right, checkmate.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.600
You don't have enough power to protect the King yet.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.900
You better work harder!

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.100
Damn!

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.870
You're so reckless...!

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.670
Don't get so upset... And don't talk back!

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.470
Scrapes and bruises... these injuries aren't too serious...

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.770
The real problem is this arm.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.430
It's broken in several places.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.270
His body isn't able to withstand his Jutsu.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.630
I see...

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.300
So that's the conclusion of the coroner's team about Kakuzu?

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.200
Yes... Although they're not completely finished yet...

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.600
In any case, we must notify the supervising Jonin about this.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.770
What will you do?

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.470
Summon Kakashi and Yamato to the coroner's room.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.030
I see...

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.170
So Hidan and Kakuzu are dead.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.030
Yes. It seems they were killed by Naruto's team.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.370
Oh...?

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.500
We thought they would take down another Akatsuki

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.930
if we let them live...

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.970
Seems like it went quite well.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.430
Not bad at all.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.900
I'm sure even the Akatsuki would never have expected

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:57.900
to lose two of their members at once.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.030
Still, they now have the Two-Tails.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.230
Maybe we should give an extra push to bring down their strengths.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.800
How is that child?

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.030
Yes.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.900
I'm planning a final test in a few days.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.700
But judging from the data, I'm certain there is no mistake.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.800
I'm looking forward to it.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.270
Just a little more until the final step.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:33.900
But for that, one more pawn is essential.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:43.700
Say, Kabuto. That woman... Would you bring her here?

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.270
That woman?

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.530
The autopsy is not complete yet...

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.170
Coroner's Office 1 But as we examined the corpse,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.030
we figured something out about Naruto's new Jutsu.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.870
The damage this fellow sustained was caused by

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.170
something totally different from the usual barrage of hits.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.400
What do you mean?

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.470
Every Chakra Network connecting his body cells has been severed.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.570
His Chakra Network...?!

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.100
Yes. A condition like this is usually unimaginable.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.070
Wind Style: Rasen-Shuriken... is this powerful...?

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.330
Rather than an offensive attack, this works more like poison.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.930
A microscopic attack that inflicts damage at the cellular level...

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.070
I'm assuming that the Wind Chakra

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.930
changed in Chakra Form into infinite small blades...

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.130
attacking all the cells within his body.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.270
What a Jutsu...

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.730
Hmm... Poison...

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.130
Rather than the number of attacks,

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.770
it should be described as a concentrated attack.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.030
And the user of the Jutsu, Naruto, is...

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.330
That's the problem.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.000
I see...

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.200
Kakashi... This new Jutsu... The Wind Style: Rasen-Shuriken.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.000
Forbid Naruto from using it again.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.200
It's that serious...?!

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.430
The same condition afflicts Naruto's right hand.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.700
Although it's not nearly as bad as this one.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.200
If he continues using this new Jutsu,

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.270
Naruto will lose his ability to mold Chakra.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.730
With such a powerful Jutsu, there's sure to be risks.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.170
If the cells are disconnected from the body's Chakra Network,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.330
even my medical skills won't cure him.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.870
Be certain to emphasize that to Naruto.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.330
Of all things, he wants to summon that woman...

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.330
That was a rude welcome... Guren.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.970
Oh, it's just you, Kabuto. I thought it was an intruder.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.400
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.430
Of course not.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.230
Besides, I wouldn't want someone who'd die so easily

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.270
to be standing beside Lord Orochimaru!

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.630
Leaf Hospital

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.500
All right, done.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.700
Now you just have to take it easy.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.270
Thanks, Sakura.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.170
Say, Naruto. This new Jutsu.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.130
Use it only when absolutely necessary.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.330
Do not  use it too often!

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.200
Don't worry. If you can make it better-

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.270
I'm not talking about that!

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.200
Medical Ninjutsu cannot heal everything right away!

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:47.170
But this kind of makes me happy.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:48.470
Huh?

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.770
I feel like you and I are getting closer to Sasuke.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.200
Geez...

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:38.700
Lady Tsunade...
