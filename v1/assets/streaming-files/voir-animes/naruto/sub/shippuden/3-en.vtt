WEBVTT

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.730
Third Training Grounds

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.100
Let's go!

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.730
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.470
Not bad.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.170
Nice... Since he's trapped in midair...

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.070
he used the Shadow Clone Jutsu as a means for movement.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.130
Transform!

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.800
Okay, that's as far as you go.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.130
He's gotten pretty tall.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.130
And not only that...

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.870
His timing for using the Shadow Clone Jutsu has gotten better.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.270
Oho...

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.670
Not bad.
That's incredible.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.270
You've grown, haven't you, Naruto?

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.200
However...

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.130
Well, it seems you're just as impatient as ever.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.070
I haven't even said start yet, have I?

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.830
Don't be so hasty. I haven't even said start yet, have I?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.700
Now then, let's begin.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.970
Ready...start!

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.670
Now then, let's begin!

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.070
Ready...start!

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.430
Damn it!

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.630
I've been had!

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.700
Come on, Naruto, you goof!

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.070
The Results of Training 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.000
Good work... Do you remember me?

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.570
Of course, I do, Lord Sasori.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.530
Of course, he does.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.270
It wouldn't be much of a Jutsu if he didn't.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.730
They become loyal subordinates after regaining their memory.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.670
I say it's about ready?

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.430
All right, it's done...

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.130
Sasori, my good man. You watch from here... Okay.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.070
I'll attack the village...

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.370
from above.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.900
What do you think of this artistic form...?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.000
Don't make me wait too long, Deidara!

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.130
One-Tail, the Jinchuriki of Shukaku, Gaara of the desert, eh?

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.930
Now then, I wonder what he's like.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.800
Now... What're you going to do, Sakura?

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.230
Right? Above? Left?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.330
Behind?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.930
If he's in none of those places...

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.230
He must be below.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.770
Huh?

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.270
Wh-What ridiculous strength.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.700
All right, well done.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.900
Fifth Hokage...

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.730
You didn't just teach Sakura Medical Ninjutsu, huh?

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.200
That short temper and incredible strength.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.970
She raised a splendid second Tsunade.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.870
Kakashi Sensei.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.700
Huh?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.230
I found you.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.930
I'd...I'd better stop acting like an idiot in front of Sakura.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.530
I'll get killed...!

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.800
She built up her maximum Chakra inside her body at once

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.170
and instantly concentrated all of it into her fist.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.670
That's a feat that can't be done without considerable Chakra control.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.200
Medical Ninjutsu along with superhuman strength...

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.800
No. It's more than that.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.770
Sakura's originally a Genjutsu-type, after all.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.070
She might just become a better Kunoichi than the Fifth Hokage.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.930
All right, now I guess it's my turn, huh?

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.030
One.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:46.630
Two.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.430
Three.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.330
So there are three people guarding the skies...

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.830
Still, this village sure has quite the artistic design to it.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.330
It's certainly worth destroying, though...

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.100
It's time for covert action from here on.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.630
There he is.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.770
The basics for a Shinobi are

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.030
to eliminate their presence and remain hidden.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.800
This is totally different from back then.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.900
The basics for a Shinobi

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.530
are to eliminate their presence and remain hidden.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.700
All right, everyone seems to be well hidden...

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.370
Now, fight me fair and square!

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.770
Say, aren't you just a little bit off there?

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.730
Let me teach the two of you something.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.070
Shinobi Battle Skills, part one...Taijutsu.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.700
You're wide open!

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.900
If I can hit him once...

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.930
It won't mean a thing if you don't hit me.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.470
Phew, that was a close one.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.670
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.400
Here I come!

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.070
All right, bring it on.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.000
The bell's mine.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.270
You won't get away!

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.630
Dancing Leaf Shadow...?!

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.700
This is Bushy Brow's...!

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.100
It's Kakashi Sensei's Copy Ninjutsu!

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.330
Now...where's the real one?

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.230
Right here.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.930
Secret Finger Jutsu.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.970
A Thousand Years of Death!

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.800
Now...where's the real one?

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.630
Right here!

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.330
Secret Finger Jutsu!

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.900
A Thousand Years of Death!

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.030
Damn it. I missed!

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.600
That was a close one... In a different sense.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.370
It used to be so easy.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.670
I'll tear you apart!

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.830
Damn it! You can't dodge this!

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.500
Geez, man!

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:28.400
Huh?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.070
Ninja don't let their opponent get behind them over and over, you idiot!

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.370
Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu!

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.830
A Thousand Years of Death!

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.030
She's over there, huh?

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.100
Sasuke, where are you?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.730
Don't tell me Sensei already got to you!

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.930
No, that'd never happen to him!

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.600
I'm safe! He hasn't noticed me!

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.170
Sakura, behind you.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.170
They've been apart for two years,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.500
and yet his teamwork with Sakura isn't that bad.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.730
Though I want to...

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.870
find out what happens next in the new volume...

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.570
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.630
As always, the sheer number of his clones amazes me...

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:38.770
Let's go!

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:39.930
- Yeah! - Yeah!

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.270
Good grief... It looks like I won't have time for reading.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.330
Things are getting interesting.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.430
Naruto and Sakura are pretty good, aren't they?

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.500
Things are just getting started.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.570
Now then, what should I do...?

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.470
Wh-What's this strange thing?!

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.130
It's not  strange, you know.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.270
Sure enough, fools don't understand what art is all about...

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.070
I'll show you with your own bodies.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.430
True art...is an explosion!

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.930
I'm sure I heard the sound of the bells from this way.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.970
There's a possibility that he rang them on purpose.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.230
Be careful.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.530
Yeah, it's Kakashi Sensei, after all.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:46.630
Sasuke!

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.030
Sasuke.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.600
Naruto, Sakura... Help me.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.100
I got away from Orochimaru.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.900
Help me.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.230
Naruto, Sakura... Please.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.670
It's too bad... I want to talk with Sasuke a little while longer, but...

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.670
Release!

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.800
I'm not interested in illusions, you see.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.970
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.130
Naruto, Kakashi Sensei's behind that tree there.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.070
Oh, no!

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.870
Yeah, I know.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.670
Rasengan!

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.130
Kakashi Sensei.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.070
Huh?

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:52.100
You have something to say, don't you? I missed it before.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.700
Shinobi Battle Skills, part two...Genjutsu.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.130
Huh?

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.830
What was that just now?

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.430
 Hey! Where'd Sensei go? Huh? Huh? What's going on?

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.270
What's what?

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.230
Sakura.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.030
Oh, Sasuke!

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:35.770
S-Sakura. H-Help me.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.870
She fell for it so easily back then...

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.800
Kakashi Sensei, talk about a lack of pizzazz.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.870
No way will we fall for the same trick over and over again.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.330
That's right, that's right.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.500
No, that's not necessarily the case.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.530
All right! He dropped the bells.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.170
Naruto, don't.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.530
They're mine...!

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.570
See? Naruto would still fall for the same trick.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.170
Huh?

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.200
No way will I fall for a trap... like this.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.330
Wha--?!

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.200
Substitution Jutsu.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.470
Damn it.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.400
You idiot. Didn't I tell you?

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.800
Sure enough, the same tricks won't work, huh?

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.470
Infiltration successful.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.330
That's as far as you go.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.670
Can you see the intense smoke from an explosion?

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.200
There's great turbulence in the skies above the Hidden Sand.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.500
Can you give us any details?

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.530
Yes. It appears Lord Kazekage is engaged in a fierce battle in the sky

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.100
with an intruder.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.270
All the residents can do is watch... Oh!

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.370
Are you all right?

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.800
It seems we have lost audio.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.900
We will continue to report the moment we receive more information.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.500
Next time: "The Jinchuriki of the Sand"
