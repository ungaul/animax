WEBVTT

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.830
Aren't you being a little too laid back?

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.570
Oh, well you know, things were pretty tense around here recently

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.870
with the incident in the Sand Village.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.170
But now that it's been settled...

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.670
I'm suddenly overcome with exhaustion...

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.700
Even so, we don't know what's going to happen next.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.570
Only by being cautious at all times are we able to prevent...

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.400
You won't last if you remain cautious at all times.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.070
Come on, relax, relax!

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.670
It's not good to tease weak ones.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.730
I set the alarm clock before I went to bed last night,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.900
and here, I get up before the alarm goes off.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.270
I can't bring myself to turn off the alarm.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.330
But if I don't, then the annoying ring won't stop.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.370
It's such a pain just thinking about this whole thing!

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.900
Seconds!

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.770
What is that?

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.370
Move, move, move!

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.270
Last spurt! Goal!

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.600
First place!

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.830
Sadly, second place!

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.370
- What kind of race is that? - Beats me...

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.500
Hey Lee, you need to train more.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.970
Yes! I will try to be first place next time.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.030
But, there is regrettable news.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.870
Wh-What is it?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.670
Lee, you are not second place.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.730
You are...third place!

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.870
Huh?!

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.170
Second place is Kakashi, whom I am carrying!

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.470
Kakashi, you are too lucky! You don't need to thank me.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.470
I feel like I learned another important lesson from you.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.770
As usual, I can't keep up with their craziness.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.800
Although we did run along after them.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.200
Ridiculous!

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.330
Okay, everyone's here, eh?!

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.100
Then let's go report to Lady Tsunade right away.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.400
Um, Guy Sensei...

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.600
What is it?

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.070
Kakashi Sensei is...

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.000
Huh? Oh!

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.600
Guess it's the hospital before reporting.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.070
The New Target 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.330
Oh! He's awake!

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.900
So I'm back here again...

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.770
Good job, Kakashi.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.270
Master...

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.170
Lady Tsunade...

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.170
No, Kakashi Sensei! Don't push yourself.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.330
I examined you earlier, but you need to be in bed for a week.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.430
It will take a few more days until you can return to duty.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.630
I guess that's how it goes...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.370
Seems it will still take a while until you can master the new Sharingan.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.300
Yes...

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.230
Just rest. Try not to push yourself for a while.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.570
Team Guy should rest today too. You can turn in the report later.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.770
Yes!

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.300
Let's go, Shizune.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.500
Yes.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.000
Oh...Master!

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.830
Is it regarding that matter?

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.230
Yes.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.300
Did you tell Kakashi?

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.500
Since Kakashi Sensei has been like that all this time, I haven't yet...

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.600
How about Naruto?

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.170
I thought I should first consult you...

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:20.970
Give me the details.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.900
It's what I heard from the Akatsuki member, Sasori.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.170
He said it was a reward for beating him...

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.870
In ten days, go to the Tenchi Bridge

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.000
located in the Village Hidden in the Grass at high noon.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.330
I've got a spy working as one of Orochimaru's subordinates...

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.970
I was supposed to rendezvous... with him...there...

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.270
In ten days...at Tenchi Bridge, huh...

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.200
Four days has passed, so it will be in six days.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.270
Can you trust your source?

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.600
Considering the situation, it's safe to say we can trust it.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.170
What would you do if it were a trap?

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.130
There is a possibility that Orochimaru is just bait,

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.100
and the Akatsuki will be waiting there.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.870
If it is a trap, I'll fight with all my might!

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.970
Fight? Kakashi will be in bed for more than a week.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.830
But we only have six days left.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.300
For that matter,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.170
ever since Sasuke left, Team Kakashi has been short on staff.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.670
Yes...

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.830
We can only add another member and create a new team.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.700
Lady Tsunade!

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.370
What is it?

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.200
Then, you should send a different unit to investigate the situation.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.700
Even if you let Sakura go, you should leave out Naruto!

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.100
Shizune...

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.130
Yes.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.770
Like you, Sakura is one of the few Ninja

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.970
whom I can trust from the bottom of my heart.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.870
I will definitely let Team Kakashi go, mostly because Sakura is on it.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.270
Wouldn't it be the same if my team went?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.000
It's not the same!

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.170
Sakura and Naruto are both desperately trying

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.430
to seek out Sasuke, their former team mate...

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.430
They wish to save Sasuke more than anyone.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.800
That strong desire will lead the mission to success.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.930
You and Sakura are different...

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.500
I understand, but, for this mission, Naruto should...

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.930
Now that he's heard this... what would Naruto say?

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.130
Let's search for our new team member immediately!

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.230
Later!

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:13.700
Sheesh, that impatient brat... I wasn't done talking yet.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.770
He has a mysterious power...

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.870
Everyone...starts wanting to place their bets on him.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.730
Becoming Hokage...is my dream...!

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.230
The child who was entrusted with the First Hokage's necklace...

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.700
Indeed, Naruto might not be an ordinary kid.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.530
Sasuke...

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.330
Hmm, who might be good?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.270
I need to think about this very carefully.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.870
It would be a pain

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.830
if I mistakenly choose someone who would slow me down.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.400
Plus, even if the person is skillful,

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.730
there might be a problem with their personality,

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.870
and that will ruin the teamwork.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.470
And Sakura is a sucker for handsome boys,

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.030
so it would be dangerous if he were too good-looking.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.730
This is hard.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.430
Long time no see, Naruto.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.400
Huh?

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.270
Who are you?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.700
It's me.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.070
Huh?

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.270
Even though we haven't seen each other for a long time,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.870
you should remember your comrade's face.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.730
Because the one that spoke to you will feel bad.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:57.170
Oh...um...that really indirect speech... could it be...?

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.030
Shino!

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.930
You finally remembered.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.070
If you cover up that much, no one will know--

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.070
Shino, you're here early!

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.530
Are you Kiba?

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.130
Oh!

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.970
This smell! It is  Naruto!

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.630
You knew it was me 'cause of that?

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.030
That dog, could it be... What are you talking about?

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.570
Of course, it's Akamaru!

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.770
Huh?!

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.300
Hey, did you grow?!

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.270
Naw, naw, naw... Akamaru is the one that grew.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.200
Do dogs become that big in such a short amount of time?

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.800
Really? Since we're always together, I can't really tell.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.430
Can't tell?! That Akamaru, he used to be on your head!

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.600
Right, Shino?!

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:24.770
Seems like you noticed Kiba right away, didn't you, Naruto?

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.430
Oh shoot, he's upset.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.230
Na...

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.600
N-Naruto...

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.670
I heard that he came back to the village.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.270
Wh-What should I do?

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.830
I'm not ready yet since we haven't seen each other for a while.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.570
What should I say...?

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.300
Um... Um...

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.370
Oh, it's Hinata!

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.070
Why are you hiding?

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.070
Huh?! Hinata.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.930
Hey, Hinata, hey, Hinata!

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.430
Why do you always faint after seeing Naruto?

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.900
Please! We need a new member!

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.700
Huh?

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.970
You came at the wrong time,

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.900
we just got a mission and we're waiting for Kurenai Sensei.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.070
What...I...?

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:02.700
But you have Akamaru, so lend us one person.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.930
Come on, Kiba?

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:06.770
What happened...?

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.600
What are you talking about?!

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.670
If I don't go I can't use the combo attack with Akamaru!

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.830
Oh yeah, I met Naruto and...

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.800
Oh that's right. Then, then...

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.370
Hey, Shino is...

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.570
You noticed Hinata right away too, Naruto.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.130
He is still sulking...

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.800
Forget it! You guys are all lousy friends!

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.730
Naruto's voice...

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.900
Hinata! Just shut up and come with me!

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.800
"Just shut up and come with me"...?

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.130
No way... no way... so suddenly...

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.900
After all that fuss, I still got rejected.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.270
In that case... I guess I'll ask those guys.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.800
Hey, Hinata, Kurenai Sensei is going to be here soon. Wake up!

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.300
Hey, Shino! Do you have water? Water!

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.000
The sky...is blue.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.700
I told you already, haven't I?

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:42.800
It's annoying, but I'm in charge of the Chunin Exam.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.130
I mean, yeah, we have a long history together,

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.800
so I want to lend a hand.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.470
But I'm not in a position to do whatever I want.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:58.000
The Fifth appointed me, so she will kill me if I reject the offer.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.770
I get scolded enough by my mother.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.370
And here I was thinking "I can count on Shikamaru,"

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.170
but you go on talking like it's so annoying and all...

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.530
Even if you look at me with those puppy eyes,

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.570
what's impossible is impossible.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.170
Then I will lend a hand!

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.170
Here! Shikamaru.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.800
This is the lunch box that your mom asked me to hand you.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.230
Choji!

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.430
Hey Choji, are you sure you can say such an irresponsible thing?

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.100
Don't you have a mission with Asuma and Ino?

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.870
I can't ignore what Naruto is saying.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.830
I will try to discuss it with Asuma Sensei.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.270
Choji, thanks!

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.970
It's not going to help

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.670
if you tell Asuma because he works under Lady Tsunade.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.570
Well, I will try to talk to him. Here's the lunch box.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.700
Oh! Thanks!

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.270
Hey, Naruto... That's my lunch box.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.170
Just like always, you're still eating, huh?

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.800
You...are fatter than before...

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.370
Oh!

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.130
Shikamaru! Behind!

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.530
Over there, huh...?

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.030
I haven't seen him before, but he wears a Leaf head band.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.530
It was so sudden...

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:20.070
I don't know what he is aiming for, but we need to capture him and...

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.530
give him to the Interrogation Unit!

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.030
I'll assist you! Go Naruto!

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.100
Right!

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.130
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.800
Indeed, Naruto is a Jinchuriki.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.230
There is no guarantee that the Akatsuki who seeks Naruto's Nine-Tailed Beast

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.670
won't become a huge disaster for the Hidden Leaf.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.530
However, Naruto will someday become a valuable Ninja to the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.530
If perchance, the Hidden Leaf Village and the Land of Fire

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.200
become endangered by my decision,

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.670
then as the Fifth Hokage, I will protect them with my life!

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.900
