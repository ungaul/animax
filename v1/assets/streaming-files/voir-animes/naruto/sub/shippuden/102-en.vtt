WEBVTT

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.570
Forgive me, Sasuke…

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.270
This is my reality…

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.470
Give me your light.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.400
I told you.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.770
You do not possess the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.430
You can never win against my eyes.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.170
I’ll take the other one too.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.500
So that is the power of the Curse Mark…

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.070
This is the difference in our strength.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.270
And…

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.730
the difference between your ocular powers and mine.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.470
That was fast… Itachi’s won.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.930
How can you tell?

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.770
Sasuke’s caught in the Tsukuyomi.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.400
He’s paralyzed. Itachi can do whatever he wants now.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.500
Huh?!

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.800
You broke through…my Tsukuyomi?!

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.070
Huh? Sasuke took a Tsukuyomi, so why isn’t he down?

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.470
No… He didn’t fall for it.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.070
He broke out of the Tsukuyomi.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.100
What?! Someone with an ordinary Sharingan could never win

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.970
against the Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.830
Even so, the Sharingan is a ninja’s weapon.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.000
A weapon is only as powerful as its wielder.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.570
It can be formidable or weak.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.470
You can have shuriken,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.530
and be taken down by a mere pebble thrown by a master.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.070
The difference is in the power.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.100
It just means that Sasuke’s skills far exceed Itachi’s expectations.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.530
Like I told you…

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.770
No matter how much you use those eyes of yours,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.200
my hate will turn illusion into reality.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.700
Humph… Make illusions a reality, eh?

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.630
Then let me throw those words right back at you.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.070
Like I told you…

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.670
No matter how much you use those eyes of yours,

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.800
my hate will turn illusion into reality.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.400
Humph… Make illusions a reality, eh?

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.300
Then let me throw those words right back at you.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.370
Amaterasu!

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.000
You saw your eyes gouged out during the Tsukuyomi just now.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.670
Well, allow me to make that a reality.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.300
The air around Itachi has shifted!

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.300
He’s gotten serious.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:12.300
Which means, we might get to see the Amaterasu.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.170
What? The Amaterasu?! I can’t wait to see it!

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.670
We were right to come see this, after all!

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.130
Continuing to use genjutsu will lead nowhere.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.300
Now that Sasuke has broken the Tsukuyomi,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.200
a genjutsu battle is pointless.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:41.130
Which means from now on, it’ll be ninjutsu against ninjutsu.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.470
If Itachi’s left Mangekyo possesses the ultimate genjutsu,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.030
then his right Mangekyo is the ultimate in physical attacks.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.370
The Amaterasu produces black flames that are said to never extinguish…

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.430
Not until it incinerates the target within the caster’s sight.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.800
Is this it, the Amaterasu?!

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.530
How quick… He’s planning to not let Itachi weave signs!

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.830
This is the Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.070
A rigged shuriken?!

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.100
That last shuriken did the job.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.400
That’s strange…

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.000
What is it?

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:08.070
It’s just that Itachi should have been able to dodge something like that.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.200
Backlash from that earlier Tsukuyomi?

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.730
I like that.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.470
From the moment Sasuke nullified the Tsukuyomi,

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.130
he seized control of the flow of the battle.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.000
Plus he slowed down Itachi’s movements.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.770
Sasuke might actually win this battle.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.570
No… We don’t know that yet.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.270
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.070
Wounds like this won’t slow me down.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.030
Phew… We almost got caught in that!

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.970
– Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! – Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.270
Sasuke has the upper hand.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.930
I really think Sasuke’s going to…

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:39.870
Amaterasu!

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.320
Ohh… There it is!

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.470
I-Incredible… He put out fire with fire.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.600
With that jutsu, he eyes whatever he wants to burn

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.400
and once the target is in focus, black flames burst forth.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.130
The black flame cannot be extinguished

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.600
until the one it targets is totally incinerated.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.530
Even if the target is also fire.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.140
I guess Itachi is the winner, after all.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.270
He stopped the Amaterasu… He’s going to take Sasuke’s eyes.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.670
Huh?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.900
He went below?!

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.740
Wounds like this won’t slow me down.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:53.440
I can’t use this Substitution Jutsu until he unleashes his Amaterasu.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.940
This is what I’ve been waiting for!

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.570
Huh?

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.070
Fire Style: Fire Jutsu!

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.500
Hey, pretty good.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:06.840
Oh no!

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.340
That Amaterasu earlier seems to have taken quite a toll on you.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.970
They’re both totally exhausted. They have no chakra left, huh?

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.170
So it appears.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.200
This will probably be my last jutsu.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.440
The Sharingan can assess chakra.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.470
Stop bluffing…

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.500
I can see that you’re out of chakra.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.800
You evaded my Amaterasu

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.940
using the Orochimaru-style Substitution Jutsu.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.470
A well-made substitution to deceive,

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.200
but it uses an enormous amount of chakra.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.640
That’s right… Sasuke did absorb Orochimaru!

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.470
So that’s it.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.270
You’re right. I don’t have any chakra left.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.640
I used it up in that last Fire Style Jutsu.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.200
However…

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:30.270
Do you really think I would come here to kill you unprepared?

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.540
It will be instantaneous.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.470
This jutsu is just like Amaterasu.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.070
It is impossible to dodge.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.500
Now… As you wished, I’ll recreate…

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.300
your death!

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.350
Oh wow… I’m glad we chose to see this once.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.180
I never thought we could see such a battle.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.950
Sasuke’s jutsu was impressive,

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.520
but to think Itachi was hiding that kind of jutsu up his sleeve.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.420
But looks like it also comes with a heavy risk…

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.720
Who will win this battle…?

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.450
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: “The End”

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.320
Either way, the next one will be their last.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.980
Seriously! Why do you pile up this much work?!

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.020
Sorry.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.350
What was Naruto’s registration number?

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.820
You don’t even know that? Naruto is #012607.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.280
Then how many missions did Sakura carry out?

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.980
Nine C-rank, six B-rank, and seven A-rank missions.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.480
Then what is Sai’s height and weight?

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.650
172 cm, 53 kg.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.850
Captain Yamato’s birthday?!

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.850
August 10th.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.980
What is Kurenai Sensei’s hobby?!

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.980
Drinking! She enjoys evening drinks!

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.780
You’re amazing, Lady Tsunade. You’re aware of everything.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.150
Me, on the other hand… Naturally. I am the Hokage!

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.320
THE OFFICIAL SHIPPUDEN HANDBOOK You’re right. How foolish to even compare myself to you.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.050
Oh, by the way… What is your hobby besides gambling?

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.780
Oh no… It’s not listed in here!

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.850
D-Don’t worry about it!

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:04.020
After all, even a Hokage can’t beat old age--!

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.750
Tune in again!
