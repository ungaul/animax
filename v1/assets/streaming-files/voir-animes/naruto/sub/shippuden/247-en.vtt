00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.270
Are you saying...

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.610
that I...

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.110
have regrets?

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.820
You told me, "I'm no one... I don't want to be anyone..."

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.980
But the truth is...

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.520
You wanted to become the Hokage, just like me.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.190
You can't hide behind a mask.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.610
You were Kakashi Sensei's friend...

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.730
my dad's subordinate... an Uchiha like Sasuke...

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.020
and a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.690
who had the same dream as me!

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.070
You used to have the same dream as me.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.650
But now you've become the exact opposite of a Hokage!

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.520
It's because you're just like me that...

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.610
No, it's because of that...

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.110
That's why I wanted to see you despairing about this world.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.860
Or...I suppose I wanted to feel again for myself,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.730
that the path that I have chosen for myself is not a mistake.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.230
There's no need to voluntarily tread a steep and rugged path,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.270
not knowing what's ahead.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.320
You'll have to step over the corpses of your comrades.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.770
Anyone would choose a shortcut with a fixed outcome.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.230
Yes... The goal a Hokage should seek is world peace.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.900
What are you saying?

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.150
What I want to know about isn't a shortcut...

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.570
but how to navigate the steep and rugged path!

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.900
Who can tell in the beginning which one is the dangerous one?

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.520
You never know unless you start walking.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.440
The Hokage is someone who endures the pain

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.940
and takes the lead in front of everyone.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.480
So a Hokage never walks over his comrades' corpses.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.520
There are no shortcuts for the one who becomes the Hokage...

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.440
There's no running away for the one who becomes the Hokage!

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.520
Isn't that right?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.230
I messed up... I got some dust in my eyes and... Oww!

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.570
I bet this Rin person would say this if she were still alive...

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.190
"Don't act tough and hide your wounds."

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.610
"I'm always watching."

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.440
You told me saving you

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.860
was the same as saving the world, remember?

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.570
Since I'm keeping an eye on you,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.270
you can't hide anything from me anymore.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.940
Okay! Okay!

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.820
Go for it, Obito!

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.320
Become Hokage and show me how you'll save the world.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.610
That's another promise!

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.860
Rin...

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.320
Rin was my only light and hope.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.110
After I lost Rin...

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.820
the world as I saw it, changed.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.860
It became a pitch-black hell.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.980
There's no hope in this world.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.940
I took Madara's identity and walked the world.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.440
But all it did was confirm my belief.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.440
Even with my Sharingan, I couldn't see anything...

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.650
There was nothing to see.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.360
I'm sure you could've seen it too, if you'd tried.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.610
After all, you and I have the same eyes.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.440
If comrades that you trust, gather around you...

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.650
hope can take physical form and become visible.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.650
That's what I believe...

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.820
Obito.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.610
Naruto's path, huh...

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.980
Madara Uchiha Arises

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.270
Sage Art: Gracious Deity Gates! Madara Uchiha Arises

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.390
Naruto's jutsu didn't bring him down,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.310
but with this, he won't be able to move at all!

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.810
All that's left is to wait for the Sealing Shinobi.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.100
Having the Tailed Beasts extracted from him

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.770
means that Obito's...

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.980
The Ten Tails' Jinchuriki aren't like all the others.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.810
They won't die if the Tailed Beast is extracted.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:15.390
It's because the Ten Tails' husk, the Gedo Statue remains.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.430
It contains a lot of life force.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.270
Is that true?

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.350
How do you know?

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.890
Hey, now.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.810
Who do you think scattered us all across the world

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.520
after splitting Ten Tails' Chakra into nine pieces?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.350
The Sage of Six Paths...

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.480
But with nine bodies extracted out of him all at once,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.850
he'll be so weak it will be like he's dead.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.770
He won't be able to move for a few months.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.230
Just as it was for the old man back then.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.270
So that's how it goes.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.890
Kakashi...

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.980
the Tailed Beast inside me just explained to me...

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.180
That's right...

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.180
Rin won't even turn to look at the current you.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.850
The one Rin wanted to watch over is Obito Uchiha.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.890
So you don't have to worry.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.140
Then...his life is...

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.100
I was hoping he would atone for all his past deeds, but...

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.730
It can't be helped if you can't move.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.520
Just stay put.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.730
Sensei, please keep an eye on Obito.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.480
All right.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.100
What are you trying to do?

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.930
The same thing the man I once tried to use...

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.930
did to betray me.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.890
No way...

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:26.140
I never imagined I'd end up doing the same thing...

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.390
It's the Gedo... Art of Rinne Rebirth.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.600
But that jutsu will result in your...!

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.850
It seems to be a jutsu that trades life for life.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:08.680
I feel like I finally understand why Nagato…

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.480
betrayed me back then.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:20.980
A string of hearts linked together like prayer beads...

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.180
That can be a strong power as well, huh...

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.520
Nagato and Naruto were both Jiraiya's students.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:36.480
So you could say Jiraiya defeated me.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.680
Sensei...

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.390
He was also your master,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.640
the one who groomed you to become the Hokage...

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.560
And I...was your student.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.390
A shinobi who gave up on becoming Hokage...

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.480
and cut all his ties.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:16.480
I won't have much to say to Rin on the other side.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.180
Are you sure about this?

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.350
You could live and atone for your sins...

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:34.430
No... That's the easy way out.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:46.480
I'll help you out this time!

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.020
Time to switch places!

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.730
It's now my turn to attack!

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.770
Stop acting tough!

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.270
This war is over!

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.810
– Sai! – I know!

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.520
Sealing Jutsu!

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.930
Crouched Tiger Bullet!

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.140
Naruto...

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.680
I'm grateful to you.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.560
You even extracted the Tailed Beasts from Obito...

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.350
Saving me the trouble of weakening him.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.350
Sorry, Obito...

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.270
This is the reason why I was stuck onto you.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.060
Black Zetsu! W-What the—?!

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.230
Okay! Just a little bit longer!

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.350
– Art of Rinne Rebirth! – Art of Rinne Rebirth!

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.730
Finally, I can fight for real!

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.350
This is the form, the body I needed!

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:36.770
It's not a battle without raging blood... and a pounding heart!

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.180
Ancient relics...

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.480
should just butt out!

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.310
A brat who doesn't even come close to my level.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.520
You stole my line.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.930
Why did he close his eyes?

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.600
Sasuke!

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.560
It's pointless to just throw attacks at him.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.390
This guy can absorb ninjutsu!

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.270
It is these two polar opposites operating together

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.730
that give rise to all things in this universe...

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.270
Hashirama, do you remember me telling you this long ago

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.430
in front of the Uchiha Stone Tablet?

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.270
That the inscription on the stone says,

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:53.770
when two opposite sides cooperate, you have true happiness.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.020
But I also told you it could be interpreted differently.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.480
That's...

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.810
The one who obtains both Uchiha and Senju powers

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:12.560
can attain true happiness.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.270
Don't you think it could be read that way as well?

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.390
Hashirama?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.020
It seems you've been doing a lot of plotting

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.520
since you left the village.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.390
No... Actually, this is something

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.100
my subordinate's comrade came up with by coincidence.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:37.060
Seems there was a fellow who thought a lot like me.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.730
However...

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.810
Me coming back to life was exactly as planned!

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.600
Damn it... I can't move!

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.310
Though things did happen out of order.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.480
Oh well.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.850
So this is Sage Art Chakra...

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.350
Is that all there is to it?

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.230
Seems like this will be easy to control.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.060
This is the perfect chance now that you're flesh and blood.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.810
This time I'll kill you for good,

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.980
and send you back to the afterlife!

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.560
Regret that you're still not a reanimation…

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.230
as you go to your death!

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.560
I can feel it...

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.730
Your Mangekyo are Choku Tomoe, a straight pattern.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.560
No wonder you have fine moves.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.390
It might be a good idea to take your eyes

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.350
until I get my Rinnegan back.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:33.100
Obito... Your usefulness is over.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.180
What did you do?

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.310
Madara…

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.390
has come back to life!

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.560
You performed the Rinne Rebirth, so you will die.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.480
This is the last step.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.680
I'm taking back that left eye.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:09.520
He'll last a little while longer while I'm attached to him.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.520
Just what are you?

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.350
You're not human.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:18.100
I am Madara's will incarnate.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.390
I will eliminate anyone who gets in Madara's way.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.230
Black Zetsu.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.980
I thought you'd been captured...

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:34.850
All of you, including Obito, greatly underestimated Madara's plan.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.730
You underestimated me as well.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.100
I-I can't move now...

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.140
I can't believe he's able to transform his blade so much

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.020
in such an instant!

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.810
Then that's perfect.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.350
You'll go to Obito and

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.770
bide your time until I give you the order.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.310
I'm going to play a little here, then head over.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.020
I just want to gauge the present Kage's strength.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.890
I got it.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:34.390
He's a useless traitor who went against Madara's plan.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.390
Until Obito dies, I'll use his body to fight you.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.350
I've got to get some use out of him,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.350
at least at the end.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.350
But killing you would be such a waste with an eye like that.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.770
How about it?

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.730
You're a survivor of the Uchiha like me.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.430
Want to join forces?

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.520
Make no mistake. You're a dead man.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.730
Fine then...

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:12.180
In any case, you don't have much time left.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.430
Fire Style... Hiding in Ash Jutsu!

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.480
Madara is regaining his past strength.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.480
Not good. His next target is...

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:54.520
I'll be taking you all next...

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.520
you filthy beasts!

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:41.490
The taste of this blood, this pain... This is my body!

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.650
I can finally experience and feel this fight.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.570
He's bleeding and wounded.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.070
In other words, he's not a reanimation anymore.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.280
How did he come back to life?

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:55.490
No way...

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.530
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Hidden Heart"

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.570
No way...with Obito?

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:08.820
THE HIDDEN HEART Tune in again!
