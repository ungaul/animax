00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.100
They're both smiling...

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.830
Yeah... He smiled for real for the first time when he drew that.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.770
Smiled from the bottom of his heart.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.570
Wh-What's this...?!

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.830
Reunion

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.370
It was in Sai's bag...

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.530
This is an assassination list that has...

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.670
an Anbu Black Ops member's own targets recorded...

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.170
It's called a Bingo Book.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.200
An assassination list...?

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.700
What are these "X" marks?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.270
In all likelihood,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.130
they're marks indicating targets that have already been eliminated.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.270
Why does Sai have such a thing?

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.770
Look at this...

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.100
Th-This is...!

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.930
Sasuke... Why does Sai...!

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.900
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.670
There's no "X" mark on this yet...

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.800
I get it... So that's what this is about?

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.170
What do you mean?!

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.830
Sai...

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.330
His mission wasn't to be a go-between for Orochimaru and Danzo.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.470
Sai's true classified mission...

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.570
was to assassinate Sasuke.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.230
That could never be!

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.070
After all, he said earlier that he was going to save Sasuke...

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.130
And he really smiled from the bottom of his heart...

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.270
This is what I wanted to show him.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.470
The picture of our dreams...

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.970
Unlike before, he's now... What if that was all...

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.970
an act in order to forestall you, Naruto?

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.470
I'm a tool for Lord Danzo. I don't exist.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.770
So no matter what you say to me, it's pointless...

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.830
The owner of this Bingo Book...

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.230
could indeed be capable of something like that.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.530
Look at this...

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.030
This man in the book next to Sasuke...

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.630
He's a Jonin from the Hidden Mist...

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.800
and the man who expressed a hard-line stance against the Leaf.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.070
Sai...defeated him, huh...?

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.930
He couldn't have been an easy opponent to defeat...

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.800
The fact that he eliminated him means that in all likelihood,

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.670
he must have resorted to every possible means.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.070
An act in order to forestall someone...

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.870
was probably all in a day's work for him.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.530
A smile is used to carry out a goal...

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.500
You tricked me with your fake smile earlier.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.030
So that's how you use a fake smile, huh...?

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.000
I'll remember that.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.500
How can you grin like that after getting punched?!

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.900
A smile is the best way to get through a tough situation.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.630
Even if it's a fake smile.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.800
Surprisingly enough, everyone gets fooled...

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.600
It said that in a book...

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.100
It's quite clear by looking at each of the people listed...

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.770
in this Bingo Book...

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.730
Sai was assigned to the disposal of people dangerous to the Leaf...

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.670
And Sasuke is also one such dangerous person.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.670
Danzo's goal...

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.570
was to bury Orochimaru's new flesh... to bury Sasuke...

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.300
In order to do that,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.530
Sai attempted to approach Orochimaru...

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.730
He didn't betray the Leaf. It was for the sake of the Leaf.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.230
That's exactly what one from a hard-line military faction would think up.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.800
There's no point in going on about that here...

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.030
It doesn't matter what Sai was ordered to do...

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.030
or what that Danzo guy's thinking about.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.130
Meeting up with Sai as quickly as possible...

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.070
and saving Sasuke is what's important!

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.130
It's indeed as Naruto says.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.670
I felt Sai's Chakra earlier. We need to go quickly.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.030
Right! Got it!

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.730
If Sai is after Sasuke...

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.000
then I'll stop him, no matter what!

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.730
Who's there?

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.770
You found me out, huh...?

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.470
But...I've already made the first move.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.470
What is your objective?

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.030
Lord Danzo's objective is to bury you...

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.200
I'm going to...

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.470
Sai!

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.400
...take you back to the Leaf!

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.300
Although at the beginning,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.170
I came here with the intention of killing you...

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.500
He's the person who acknowledged me more than anyone else.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.400
Naruto...thinks of Sasuke like a brother.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.030
I'll do whatever it takes to save him.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.030
I'll even team up with you.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.700
Even if I get chopped up into pieces,

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.900
I'll take Sasuke back from Orochimaru!

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.270
Sasuke is my friend.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.830
It's a special bond I was finally able to make...

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.470
I want to protect his bond with you,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.900
the one he's desperately trying to draw closer to.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.000
Bond...

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.630
You interrupted my sleep for something like that...?

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:21.700
What was that?!

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.300
It's Sai's Chakra.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.830
That way, right?

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.900
What was that...?

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.730
Sasuke, huh...?

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.830
That kid wakes up in a bad mood, you see...

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.900
Impressive...

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.430
To think he'd break free from my Jutsu by force...

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.770
I found him!

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.730
Sakura!

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.200
You! What're you really after?!

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.000
How many times do you have to betray us until you're satisfied...?

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.570
Sakura, huh?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.170
That voice...

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.970
Sa...su...ke...

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:56.870
Sasuke...

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.530
Naruto, huh...?

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.230
So even you were here, huh?

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.030
Then is Kakashi also with you?

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.600
Sorry, it's not Kakashi... I'm his substitute.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.330
Team Kakashi will now be taking you back to the Leaf.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.030
Team Kakashi, huh?

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.570
Sai! I knew it!

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.430
So he's my replacement, huh...?

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.600
Some soft one has once again joined up.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.970
He said he wanted to protect the bond...

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.630
between Naruto and me, but...

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.400
Sai... I thought your mission was to kill Sasuke.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.300
My classified mission was indeed the assassination of Sasuke...

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.130
But I've had enough of orders...

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.230
I now want to act on my own beliefs.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.400
I think Naruto will get me to remember...

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.930
my past emotions.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.400
I kind of get the feeling...

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.730
it's something very important to me.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.870
I don't know you very well.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.770
But there must be some kind of reason why Naruto and Sakura...

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.770
have pursued you so desperately.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.830
They don't want to sever their bonds with you...

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:11.830
They're giving it their all to secure those bonds.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.200
I still don't understand it all that clearly...

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.370
But Sasuke... you should understand.

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.670
Yeah... I did understand.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.530
That's why I severed the bonds.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.800
Knock it off!

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.030
That's just what I want!

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.670
Why?

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.930
I haven't narrowed the gap at all since back then.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.300
What's up with this difference?

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.330
You're weak.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.370
You're weak...

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.900
because you don't have enough...

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.670
hatred.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.300
I have different bonds...

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.030
Bonds of hatred... with my older brother.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.400
You've severed our bonds?

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.330
If that's what you say,

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.230
then why didn't you kill me back then?!

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.530
You think that would sever it, Sasuke?!

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.730
It's not that I couldn't sever the bond shared with you.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.230
It's just that your life was spared back then...

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.400
because of my passing whim.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:03.700
And because of my passing whim, you will now lose your life.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.830
Next Time: "The Power of Uchiha"
