WEBVTT

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.010
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.100
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.520
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.440
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.240
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.540
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.750
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.380
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:00:49.780 --> 00:01:00.010
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.010
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.180
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.400
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.900
koete Someday...

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.700
Planetary Devastation

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.270
The power of the Nine-Tails...

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.970
SEAL

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.100
It's responding to Naruto's rage.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.700
Do you hate me?

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.300
Do you still think people can truly understand one another?

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.370
Your actions are justified.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.170
But know this...

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.900
My pain is far greater than yours!

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.270
Let's go!

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.030
Is that all you've got?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.230
Not bad.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.530
This chakra...

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.670
I've felt it before.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.170
What's going on?

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.370
Lady Hinata went out to save Naruto.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.000
Don't tell me she's...

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.300
A Sealing Jutsu?

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.130
He broke the Seal...

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.400
Here he comes!

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.030
He's fast!

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.930
Almighty Push!

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.370
Impossible...

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.530
He withstood my Almighty Push!

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.030
Naruto.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.830
Universal Pull!

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.430
What was that?!

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.070
Oh my god... What is that?

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.400
How is Naruto doing?

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.470
How can I put it?

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.670
Naruto is showing six tails right now.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.870
At this rate, he may end up transforming into the Nine-Tails.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.970
Six tails?!

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.930
Six... It's much worse than last time!

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.900
Lady Katsuyu. Please tell everyone to evacuate immediately.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.430
Now what?

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.900
The Leaf Village is destroyed beyond recognition.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.970
You must all evacuate as far away as you can!

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.870
This is due to Naruto's Nine-Tails power!

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.400
I know because my clone is attached to Naruto.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.870
He transformed into the Nine-Tails?

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.430
But Yamato and Kakashi should have placed a Sealing Jutsu on him!

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.230
How did this happen?

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.930
It was Hinata.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.370
She tried to save Naruto and was taken down right in front of him.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.600
And then Naruto...

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.500
So that triggered his transformation?

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.700
Yes...probably.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.370
Where is Yamato?

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.230
What is he doing at a time like this?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.000
Did you find Kabuto?

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.330
Yes.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.900
Good. Don't let him spot you.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.930
Wh-What?!

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.730
What is it?

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.330
SIX It can't be... He undid the Sealing Jutsu on his own!

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.330
Six Tails?! That's insane!

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.670
There's an emergency.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.900
Sorry, but I must return to the village!

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.330
H-Hey!

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.170
The power of the Nine-Tails...

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.930
How magnificent.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.430
Both Naruto and Pain are moving away from the village.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:47.970
What?

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.700
It seems Pain is fleeing from the Nine-Tails Naruto.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.070
Serves him right!

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.170
This is no time for laughs.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.000
We have to make sure Hinata is okay,

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.400
and then do something about Naruto.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.970
The way he is now, he'll attack anyone in sight.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.370
I have to get a hold of Captain Yamato.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.330
I've brought Tendo close enough.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.130
Planetary Devastation...

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.070
You don't have to go that far.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.870
Your body can't take any more.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.070
Silence, Konan. I must focus.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.370
Planetary Devastation!

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.270
Why did you push yourself to make it that huge?

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.100
My opponent is the Nine-Tails.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.130
I cannot ease up.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.900
The Sage of the Six Paths is said to have created the moon.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.430
This is nothing compared to that.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.170
Regardless...

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.830
I have now captured the Nine-Tails.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:19.700
Why?

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.830
Why did it come to this?

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.030
How would you confront this hatred, in order to create peace?

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.930
I want to hear your answer.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.370
How should I know?

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.570
It hurts... I hate this.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.770
I don't know...

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.170
What am I supposed to do?

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.330
I don't know anything anymore!

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.230
Someone, help me...

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.530
Give me the answer.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.470
Destroy everything.

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:23.470
Erase everything that hurts.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.430
Give me your soul.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:35.270
I will save you from your suffering.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.370
Yes... You're doing fine.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:11.570
EIGHT Eight?! This is bad.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.470
This is really, really bad!

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.530
I never imagined it would be this powerful.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.070
Come over here.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.000
Come...

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.400
Rip this Seal off me.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.200
Dammit... It's too late.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.930
NINE NINE How could this happen?

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:31.570
FOURTH HOKAGE

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.770
You're...

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.930
Fourth...Hokage...

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:01.870
Naruto...

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:16.350
When the fireworks suddenly explode in the air...
fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.850
I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face...
muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:31.070
sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly...

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:46.920
It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you...
kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:53.300
Because I always remember you, in situations like this...
kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto

00:21:53.660 --> 00:22:00.430
I can't help but think about the times we spent together.
mata omoidashiteshimau yo

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:09.900
I'm ready to forget you...
mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:14.030
It just tears at my heart too much.
konna ni mo kanashikute

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:21.200
I wonder... why did we meet each other?

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:24.960
doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes...

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:33.250
me wo tojireba It's like you are here.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:33.250
ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.570
Why did you seal the Nine-Tails inside of me?!

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.100
I had to go through so much because of it!

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.770
I trained really hard, met a lot of people,

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.000
and it made me really happy!

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.170
But then the Akatsuki came after me, and my friends!

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.130
Dammit, I don't know what I'm saying anymore!

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.330
It must have been hard for you... I'm sorry, Naruto.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.100
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Fourth Hokage"

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.800
How old are you now, Naruto?

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.800
Tune in again!
