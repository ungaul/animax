WEBVTT

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.000
The All-Knowing That's the First Hokage?

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.420
The real Hashirama who's been touted as a God of Shinobi?

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.130
Don't tell me it's that shinobi Orochimaru again!

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.630
What do you mean?

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.210
I suspect he undid the Reaper Deal

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.670
that has been keeping us sealed away.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.750
And then performed the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.090
No way...

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.340
You found out how to undo that Sealing Jutsu?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.750
How did you do that Mr. Orochimaru?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.920
You underestimate me, Minato.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.790
Originally a Sealing Jutsu of the Uzumaki Clan...

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.960
I've been researching the ruins and scattered documents

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.290
of the now extinct clan ever since I lost my jutsu.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840
Lord First...

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.540
It appears we've been recalled into the world of the living.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.500
Who the hell are you?!

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.810
Oh, uh...

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.480
The Fourth Hokage, sir.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.140
Oh? The Fourth Hokage, you say?

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.600
I see!

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.390
So the village has remained stable!

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.310
Well, I'm not actually sure if it has or not.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.730
Because I died and was sealed away much earlier than Lord Third.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.520
Huh? Is that so...

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.520
In a separate incident than when I was sealed away with Sarutobi?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.770
Yes... a completely separate incident.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.600
So who's the Fifth Hokage?

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.270
Your granddaughter, Princess Tsunade.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.480
Tsuna, huh?

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.230
Is the village okay?

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.310
Is there something to be worried about?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.440
She was my first grandchild, so I spoiled her rotten!

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.600
In the end, she even picked up my gambling habit...

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.940
He's not what I expected

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.600
of someone considered to be the God of Shinobi!

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.060
How do I put it?

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.690
The Reanimation Jutsu again...

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.190
I can't believe the jutsu I devised would be used so casually.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.770
It's not a complex jutsu.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.100
However, you should not have created it in the first place.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.440
Lord Second...

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.310
Many of your policies and jutsu that you developed

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.100
ended up causing problems later on down the line.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.810
Even now... Why you!

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.810
Are you planning on attacking the Leaf again?!

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.100
I took away your jutsu in exchange for my own life.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.480
Yet you still--!

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.640
And this time you revived me, your former master,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.600
to pit me against the Leaf!

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.690
Conflict, no matter what the era.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.770
It certainly cannot be called that great a jutsu.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.270
Tobirama, that's why I told you that time to...

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.850
Will you be quiet, big brother?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.310
I am trying to talk to this stripling right now.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.100
But I... Shut up!

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.060
So not dignified for the God of Shinobi!

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.230
Please do not misunderstand.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.230
I don't have any more leanings in that direction.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.100
Haven't you noticed that I'm not suppressing your personalities?

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.100
There are certain circumstances at play this time.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.640
I'm merely creating a stage for discourse per his strong desire.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.690
I'm Sasuke Uchiha and I want to ask you Hokage some things.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.980
Is that you Sasuke?

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.600
You belong to the Uchiha?

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.640
Of course you'd stick with a scoundrel.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.390
Tobirama! I told you to stop saying such things!

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.810
You're too soft, big brother!

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.440
Never mind me.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.310
Lord Third...

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.270
Why did you make Itachi do what he did?

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.020
So, you've learned of what happened.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.730
I...killed Itachi to avenge the Uchiha Clan.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.100
Afterwards, I learned the truth from Tobi and Danzo.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.640
And I leaned towards swearing vengeance against the Leaf.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.730
However, I want to hear it straight from your mouth.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.190
Everything regarding Itachi.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.890
So it came to that...

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.440
Not only did I have him kill his brethren...

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.270
I also had him bear the false charge of traitor...

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.350
and keep tabs on the Akatsuki all by himself.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.230
From the time he was a small child,

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.480
Itachi paid attention to the teachings and signs

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.730
of our predecessors that no one else gave heed to.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.640
He was a sensitive child

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.690
who understood our village's past and our shinobi.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.600
And perhaps due to that,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.230
the trappings of a clan never bound Itachi.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.480
He was able to think ahead about the future

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.730
of shinobi and of the village.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.980
And constantly had misgivings regarding those futures.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.440
Even at the age of seven, he thought like a Hokage.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.690
We left everything to Itachi in his hands alone...

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.850
and he executed his missions perfectly.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.730
He killed his entire clan and stopped a revolt.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.600
Prevented a coming war all by himself.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.440
He even infiltrated the Akatsuki as a spy to protect the village.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.480
On the condition that I protect you within the village.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.190
So it's all true.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.140
This is part of the Uchiha's cursed fate.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.600
I can't believe they're on the brink of extinction.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.560
So they even plotted a coup...

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.640
I'd envisioned that it might come to something like that.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.850
The rebellious elements bearing Madara's will had been smoldering.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.140
But you're the one who drove the Uchiha to it, Lord Second...

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.560
It could be said that the seeds got sown

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.350
with the Uchiha Police Force that you created.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.730
What did you say?

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.810
Those who crack down on crime tend to be easily disliked.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.600
The more authority such a group has,

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.560
the more conceited it can get.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.890
By building the Police Station next to the prison

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.730
under the pretext of facilitating the monitoring of criminals,

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.890
you conspicuously shoved the Uchiha Clan

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.600
to the margins of the village.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.390
That's what fostered the adherents to Madara.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.730
Tobirama!

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.140
Did I not emphasize to you over and over again

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.560
not to slight the Uchiha?

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.230
But I gave them positions that they were eminently qualified for.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.640
And I believed that even if another Madara were to emerge,

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.770
he could be dealt with right away.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.270
As you well know, older brother, the Uchiha are...

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.890
...a clan possessed by evil!

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.690
It's like Madara left a psychological scar upon you.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.190
To cause such fear of the Uchiha.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.020
You stripling. You do not know Madara.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.770
Second Hokage, a question for you...

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.310
What is it about the Uchiha Clan? What do you know?

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.770
The Senju and Uchiha Clans

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.640
share a long history of battling each other.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.980
We were once bitter enemies.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.390
I know that already...

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.810
What did you mean about the Uchiha being possessed by evil?

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.980
There used to be a thought that in contrast to the Senju Clan,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.020
who based their strength in love as opposed to jutsu...

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.190
The basis of the Uchiha Clan's strength

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.980
was the power of their jutsu.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.940
However, the truth is actually different.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.520
There is no clan that feels deeper love than the Uchiha.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.140
And that is why the Uchiha have suppressed and sealed it away.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.730
What do you mean?!

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.730
Once a member of the Uchiha knows love, it's almost as if

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.230
all of his or her previously checked emotions are released.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.770
They awaken a profound love and power

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.980
that exceeds even the Senju's.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.020
But why is that a problem?

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.560
It should help things go smoothly with the Senju too...

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.440
This super-strong power of love, right?

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.560
Except it is quite problematic.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.350
This great power hides within it

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.600
the possibility of going out of control.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.560
When an Uchiha who has known love loses that deep love,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:22.690
it is replaced by an even stronger hate that changes them.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.600
I've seen it happen quite a few times.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.640
And that's when a special condition emerges.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.690
Condition?

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.600
When an Uchiha writhes in agony over the loss

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.940
of a great love or disappointment in themselves,

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.310
a unique chakra is released inside their brain and

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.730
reacts with the optic nerves and changes appear that person's eyes.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.770
The eyes that reflect the heart.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.770
This is what we call the Sharingan.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.560
The Sharingan taps into the power of that person's heart,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.560
rapidly increasing their strength, along with the power of their hate.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.310
There were many sensitive individuals among the Uchiha,

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.350
and nearly all who were exposed to strong emotions

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.770
were taken over by darkness and fell to evil.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.310
The deeper the darkness gets

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.600
the greater the Visual Prowess becomes,

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.690
until the person can no longer be stopped.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.730
Just like Madara.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.640
Madara cared deeply for his younger brother...

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.730
His love was, perhaps, greater than your brother's love for you.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.190
I thought I had arranged and guided things as such

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.060
that the Uchiha's power could be harnessed to serve the village.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.230
Although if they self-destructed for the sake of the village,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.890
then so be it.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.230
Either way, in the end, they were of use to the Leaf Village.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.980
Tobirama! Stop talking like that!

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.560
You are speaking to an innocent Uchiha child!

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.390
What is all-important is the village.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:47.690
The village is the keystone.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.230
I know that you know that too older brother.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.770
It doesn't bother me.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.350
I am neither innocent nor a child.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.890
It's not the standard pattern...

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.310
It's the Mangekyo Sharingan...

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.940
First Hokage... I ask you this...

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.480
What does it mean to be a village?

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.480
And what does it mean to be a shinobi?

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.920
What is a village, and what are shinobi?

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.750
My older brother Itachi, despite having been used by the Leaf,

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.500
defended the village with his life.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.540
He died a proud Leaf Shinobi.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.210
So what exactly is this village,

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.210
that one strives to protect even if it means killing one's kin?

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.210
Even if it means their own death?

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.500
And what are shinobi who've created such circumstances

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.960
and consider them acceptable?

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.130
I'll listen to your response and find out the truth,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.880
and then I'll make my decision...

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.670
Whether or not to declare vengeance against the Leaf.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.290
Or...

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.250
Orochimaru... What is it?

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.460
You once tried to destroy the Leaf...

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.960
At first, when you said you did it on a whim, I believed you.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.750
But now, I know it was something different.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.250
What was the real reason?

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.210
Vengeance against the Hidden Leaf?

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.540
You brat possessed with the Uchiha evil!

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.630
In that case I shall...

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:32.880
Lord Second!

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.710
Tobirama!

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.210
Now we're talking presence!

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.460
Lower your finger.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.420
All right...

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.210
Don't get your chakra so riled up, brother.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.210
Sorry about that!

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.210
Wow, that's incredible!

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.540
You haven't changed a bit, Lord Hashirama...

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.040
Well then, Sasuke, you had a good older brother.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.380
He was a greater shinobi than I ever was!

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.500
I don't mind telling you more about the village,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.040
but it will take a while.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.920
If possible, could you please tell the child

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.250
everything he wants to know quickly?

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.590
We don't have much time.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.930
No time?

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.700
We're in the middle of a war.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.840
Madara Uchiha has been revived

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.670
and apparently intends to erase all the shinobi of this world.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.340
Always conflict, no matter what the era.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.460
I definitely feel some powerful chakra

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.540
in the direction of 2 o'clock.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.500
This is Naruto and Nine Tails' chakra.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.880
I see

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.380
So you did it, Naruto!

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.500
And you're fighting together... even now!

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.590
It seems to be true.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.250
I'm definitely sensing Madara's chakra.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.210
Then we ought to head to the battlefield.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.210
As all of you are under the control of my Reanimation Jutsu,

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.500
your movements can be restricted.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.340
If you insist,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.340
you may head to the battlefield after we finish talking.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.920
Talk later!

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.420
Do you truly understand

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.880
the gravity of Madara having been revived?

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.630
I'm sticking with this child.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.210
If Sasuke isn't satisfied with your explanation,

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:42.340
I may use all of you to destroy the Leaf now.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.840
The timing couldn't be better.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.420
This jutsu--!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.290
Orochimaru, was it?

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.630
You seem to be misunderstanding something.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.960
The fact that you've upped the precision of the Reanimation

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.210
since the last time shall be your downfall.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.880
Now that we've been revived at close to our original power...

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.170
I am not someone who can be bound

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:14.130
by the Reanimation of one such as you.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.340
Do not forget,

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.210
I am the one who devised this jutsu in the first place.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.290
Older brother, you must agree that we have no choice.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.880
I will take action!

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.790
Sarutobi, you sure raised quite a shinobi.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.790
It is an honor to be praised by the God of Shinobi himself.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.290
He's acquired my cells and enhanced his power to bind us!

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.250
Tobirama... Your instincts have dulled a bit.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.960
Damn him... Taking a closer look,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.750
most of his body is composed of my older brother's cells...

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.710
Now then...

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.790
First Hokage Hashirama...

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.420
He's different.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.250
He could undo my binding at any time...

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.040
I have to be careful not to let down my guard.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.920
Orochimaru... Do not fret.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.290
My priority is to undo the ill feelings

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.250
that are binding this child.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.460
I don't know what he will decide after he is done listening to me...

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.380
But if we ignore him now,

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.420
he will definitely become the next Madara.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.420
If that happens, ending the war and winning will be meaningless.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.750
Do as you please, older brother.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:37.090
Now then... Where should I start?

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.670
Yes...

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.420
In order to talk to you about village and shinobi...

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.420
Wood Style: Wood Dragon Jutsu!

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.340
I must first speak of the Uchiha and Senju Clans...

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.920
Wood Style!

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.590
Wood Golem Jutsu!

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.710
The Wood Style Wood Expulsion Jutsu, was it?

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.420
Perfect for taking on difficult beasts...

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.630
He clad his Susano'o around the Tailed Beast like armor!

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.250
Madara, you crafty fox!

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.420
I can read your sword swings!

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.670
Wood Style: Laughing Buddha Jutsu!

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.420
At this rate, this land will be completely obliterated.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.420
It's best to move this to the seashore!

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.630
You're not getting away!

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.500
There, try grabbing that!

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.500
What will you do now?!

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.670
Summoning...

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.750
Five-Layer Rashomon!

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.210
This... will change the trajectory!

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.290
All the way to the other shore?

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.920
Hashirama...

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.340
It's been a while since we've fought each other earnestly!

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.540
You can see that I have changed!

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.000
You're going to lay everything to waste?

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.340
To all we've accomplished up until now, Madara?

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.840
Nothing will come of us battling each other...

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.630
This fight will only hurt the village and shinobi!

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.170
This is an insult towards our siblings and our friends!

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.250
You know nothing of my--!

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.540
I don't want to kill you!

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.290
Are you implying that you could kill me at any time?

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.880
No! I'm saying we're friends!

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.000
I've already...reached it!

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.130
Then so be it...

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.840
Sage Art:

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.040
Wood Style:

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.340
Veritable 1000-Armed Kan'on

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.670
Here I go, Madara!

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.210
Bring it, Hashirama!

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.900
Aim it a little higher than you'd expect, and then...

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.860
I know that!

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.740
It will reach the other side if I put my all into it!

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.740
Besides who are you anyway?

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.280
First name's Hashirama. I can't tell you my last name.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.650
Hashirama, huh?

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:53.690
That was...

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.610
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Hashirama and Madara"

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.940
...the first time I encountered Madara Uchiha.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:09.820
HASHIRAMA AND MADARA Tune in again!
