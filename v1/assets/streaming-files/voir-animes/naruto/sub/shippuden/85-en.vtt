00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.930
~Thanks for watching on Crunchyroll.com~

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.500
You finally came.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.330
What is the situation?

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.530
I'd say there are about fifty of the enemy.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.300
Compared to that, there are just four of us left alive.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.800
It'll all be over soon. We will all attack at once.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.700
Everyone, please direct these kunai knives towards the enemy all at once.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.200
I will do the rest...

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.170
That's crazy! Not even you could...

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.300
Shut up and do as he says.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.170
We're about to see the Yellow Flash of the Leaf in battle.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.300
It'll happen in a flash. Don't miss it.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.130
It's healing well...

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.570
But don't over-exert yourself or you'll open up the wound.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.600
When you and I were wounded,

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.000
Rin saved our lives with her Medical Ninjutsu!

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.200
If she hadn't been there, we'd both be dead by now!

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.370
Right now, saving Rin takes priority over the mission!

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.570
Kakashi, rules and regulations are indeed important.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.000
But that isn't everything. Didn't I teach you...?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.430
There are times when the situation requires

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.600
impromptu responses against the enemy.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.800
I believe that the White Fang was a true hero...

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.870
Sure in the world of ninja,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.900
those who break the rules and regulations are regarded as scum...

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.130
But...

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.030
those who abandon their comrades are worse than scum!

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.300
Kakashi Chronicles ~ A Boy's Life on the Battlefield ~ Part 2

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.900
I found them...

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.730
Calm down... I can do this!

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.230
I'll take care of it.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.130
In the meantime, use your genjutsu and get the information from her.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.900
Camouflage Jutsu...

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.430
All right... Here I go!

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.100
Go where?

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.970
K-Kakashi... How come you're...?!

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.800
Well, I can't leave this up to a crybaby ninja like you, can I?

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.600
Kakashi...

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.330
That silver-white hair and White Chakra Blade...!

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.070
Don't tell me you're... the "White Fang" of the Leaf?!

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.770
This is my father's keepsake.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.300
To carry out his mission, useful tools are essential to a ninja.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.770
Something like emotions are useless.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.370
Kakashi...you...

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.030
I see... You're the White Fang's kid...

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.500
Then there's no need to be afraid of you.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.270
I thought so.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.770
The scent has been completely erased.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.570
We'll have to locate him

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.800
by the slightest movement and noise he makes.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.000
Wh-Where is he?

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.970
Obito, behind you!

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.830
My eye...!

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.370
Kakashi!

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.670
Hey Kakashi! Are you all right?!

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.000
Even if he's just a kid, it doesn't hurt to be cautious...

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.770
I'll take it nice and slow.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.230
Our enemy... He's good...

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.730
He threw away the kunai knife stained with the smell of my blood.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.200
Don't tell me you got dust in your eye again?

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.800
A ninja shouldn't cry...

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.770
I'm not dead yet.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.430
Stay focused!

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.670
There's no way dust can get into your eyes

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.600
when you have goggles on.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.470
If you're going to advocate self-control, don't just mouth the words.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.070
Act strong too.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.570
I'm just talk... Always being saved by others...

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.470
Just a big-mouthed loser...

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.400
But...

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.170
I believe that the White Fang was a true hero...

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.300
Those who abandon their comrades... are worse than scum!

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.570
I don't want those words to be just empty talk!

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.170
Die!

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.200
Wh-Why...?

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.800
There's no way you can see...

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.130
Obito... You...!

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.370
Wh-What is... that eye...?

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.630
This time... I'll protect my comrade!

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.730
Obito... That eye of yours...

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.370
Yeah... I guess this is the Sharingan.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.400
I can now see the movement and flow of chakra.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.100
Are you all right, Kakashi?!

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.670
Yeah...

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.770
Looks like I lost my left eye,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.930
but I have the kit Rin gave me.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.330
I can use it for emergency first-aid.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.800
We're going to save Rin immediately!

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.800
Okay!

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.870
You're surprisingly stubborn.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.170
Hmm.... They're all so pathetic.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.830
The flow of Rin's chakra is disturbed...

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.670
It's different from your chakra or mine.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.300
She's probably under a genjutsu...

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.330
They didn't waste any time trying to get the information out of her.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.530
It seems they're not mere kids.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.900
We fought him earlier. He's fast... Stay alert!

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.870
Right!

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.570
Release!

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.170
Kakashi... Obito...!

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.400
We've come to save you, Rin!

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.600
You'll be all right now.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.630
All right, now let's get out of here!

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.230
I see...

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.730
You two made a good team, but you're still just kids.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.800
Right now, you're in enemy hands.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.130
Earth Style: Rock Breaker!

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.400
This is bad!!

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.000
Run for the exit!

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:28.500
Kakashi!

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.730
Too bad, I lost a good source of information...

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Oh well, it can't be helped.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.770
Are you all right? Rin...? Kakashi...?

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.430
Obito!

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.500
Don't... It's okay, Kakashi.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.730
I don't think...I can make it...

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.430
My right side is totally crushed.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.500
I can't even feel anything...

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.230
Dammit!!

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.130
No... This can't be... Why...?

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.530
Obito...!

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.770
Dammit!

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.900
Dammit!!

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.900
If...If only I had listened to you,

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.970
and we had come to rescue Rin in the first place...

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.230
This never would've happened!

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.430
So what if I'm a captain?! So what if I made jonin?!

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.500
Oh yeah... I had forgotten...

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.230
I was the only one who...

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.600
didn't give you a gift...

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.230
for becoming a jonin, Kakashi.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.370
I was...wondering what to give you...

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.170
and I just had a thought.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.430
Don't worry...

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.070
It's not some useless, extra baggage...

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.530
I'm giving you...my Sharingan.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.800
Whatever the village may say...

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.430
you are...a great jonin.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.300
That's how I really feel...

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.470
So please accept it.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.270
Rin... Use your Medical Ninjutsu...

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.770
Take the entire eye and transplant... my Sharingan...

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.230
into Kakashi's left eye.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.330
Kakashi, come over here... I'll start it right away.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.230
I'm about to...die...

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.270
But...I'll become your eye and...

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.470
see the future...for you.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.700
How stubborn... You're still alive, huh?

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.170
But...you're just a kid, after all.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.770
What's a ninja crying for?

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.300
Come on, crybaby! Let's settle this.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.800
That kid... He seems different than before...

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.630
Kakashi...take care of...Rin.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:55.300
Yeah...

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.670
Don't panic...Rin.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.200
Kakashi... Take Rin...

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.970
Take Rin and...get out...of here.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.070
Enemy reinforcements... will be coming.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.800
Obito...

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.170
It's okay... Just go...

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.070
Rin!

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.800
Earth Style! Earthquake Slam!

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.030
Rin, hurry, take my hand!

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.270
Rin!

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:58.800
Obito!!

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:07.400
Just when Kakashi and I were... starting to get along...

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.130
I couldn't tell Rin that I... loved her...

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.430
I wish...I could've spent more time... with everyone.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.030
Obito!

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.500
Damn it...!

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.000
Obito... This is the jutsu you helped me perfect!

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:13.500
Hmm... You still have the will to fight, even in this situation?

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.600
No wonder you were able to sneak so deep into enemy territory.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.100
You are a determined one.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.370
Rin! I'll hold them off! Get out now!

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.570
But...!

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.530
I promised Obito I'd look after you...

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.230
I'll protect you with my life!

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.330
Kakashi...

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.830
Rin... Obito cared about you.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.900
He loved you... You were everything to him.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.070
That's why he gave his life to protect you.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.770
Then, Kakashi! You should know my feelings for you...

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.670
I...!

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.030
I tried to abandon you... I'm nothing but scum.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.230
Rin, go!

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.000
Am I...dead?

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.630
Where am I?

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.930
Looks like you've regained consciousness.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.030
Huh?!

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.330
Sensei! But how...?

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.600
The jutsu formula on this kunai knife serves as a marker

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.500
when I leap using the Transportation Technique.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.330
Then...the enemy?

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.800
I took them all down...

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.700
Rin... Where is Rin?!

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.230
I'm sorry I couldn't make it in time, Kakashi...

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.400
Rin told me everything.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.270
The Third Great Ninja War.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.870
With the sacrifice of many nameless ninja,

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:25.570
this long war finally came to a close.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.230
In its wake, it also left legends...

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.930
The stories of great heroes,

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.300
to be told and retold for generations to come.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.700
The Battle of Kannabi Bridge...

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.070
That day, two heroes were born in the Hidden Leaf Village,

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.030
each with his own Sharingan.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.930
One found his name engraved on the memorial stone.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.770
The other came to be known as "Kakashi of the Sharingan."

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.500
In time, the tales of his bravery spanned all borders, and beyond.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.700
Capture Itachi Uchiha...

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.030
It won't be an easy mission.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.130
But it's something I can't avoid.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.230
To bring back Sasuke, eh?

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.430
I'm sure you're aware of this,

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.270
but Sasuke is now powerful enough to even kill Orochimaru.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.330
I know that. But I never go back on my word.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.330
That's my Ninja Way.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.130
Next time: "Assemble"

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.330
Tune in again!
