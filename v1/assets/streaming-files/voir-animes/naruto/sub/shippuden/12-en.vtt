WEBVTT

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.670
Over there, huh...

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.670
Any closer and I'll be noticed...

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.600
Big Sister...

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.030
Are you taking those with you?

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.070
Fate must have meant for this to happen...

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.570
Nothing will serve me better than these

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.400
if I'm gonna fight against him...

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.400
I've lived too long a life...

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.230
The Retired Granny's Determination 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.100
So...that's where his hideout is.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.330
Most likely.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.070
Gaara's scent was also coming from that same place.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.430
I see.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.600
I have one more favor to ask you.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.870
Huh?

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.200
Hey, are you awake, Naruto?

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.030
Huh? Pakkun...

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.500
Okay, Pakkun, I'm counting on you.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.230
See you around then, Naruto!

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.870
Kakashi Sensei!

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.500
Could it be that you've found the Akatsuki's hideout?

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.330
Yeah... We're heading out immediately.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.070
What, Gaara's whereabouts have been--?!

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.870
Yes ma'am! His whereabouts have just been located.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.430
The Leaf are preparing to depart immediately!

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.300
Understood! Gather our skilled men immediately!

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.730
I will be heading out as well!

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.830
Yes, ma'am!

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.070
Temari...

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.270
Kankuro, don't be so reckless!

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.870
You need to stay in bed and take it easy!

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.600
I will get Gaara back, no matter what!

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.670
All right, as soon as the Sand is ready,

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.200
we'll join them for Gaara's rescue.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.130
Got it?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.770
Sorry to have kept you waiting!

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.470
Temari!

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.370
Everyone's here...

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.330
All right! Then let's head out!

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.370
Wait!

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.200
Temari... You and the others stay here in the village and patrol the border.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.770
What do you mean by that?!

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.900
That's an order from...above.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.070
Huh...?

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.300
Their reasoning is...

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.870
if it becomes widely known that the Kazekage is absent,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.470
there's no telling when other villages will attack our village...

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.330
I can't believe this... That's all the more reason that

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.600
we have to get Gaara back as soon as possible!

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.270
These Leaf people came all this way

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.300
for the very purpose of going to Gaara's aid!

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.000
Gaara is our  Kazekage, right?!

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.970
What's the point if we, the Sand people, don't go to save him!

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.100
But... I'm going.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.030
The only Sand Shinobi you need is me!

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.670
Granny Chiyo!

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.400
But that's...

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.700
I am already retired, you know...

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.330
I can do whatever I like.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.630
You really shouldn't overdo it...!

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.200
Don't you dare treat me like an old woman!

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:01.330
She jumped!
Wha--?!

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.130
I haven't doted on my dear grandchild for a while, after all...

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.100
All right, we'll head out.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.970
Sorry... I will try to convince the higher-ups...

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.500
We'll follow behind later, no matter what!

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.770
Gaara will be long rescued by that time!

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:51.830
See you later!

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.300
Damn! If only I were physically fit.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.330
There'd be no stopping me from going...!

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.170
Hey, we're going a little too fast!

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.670
We haven't stopped running since we left!

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.070
Let's take a little break!

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.770
Tenten, you need more training!

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.370
Lee! In front of you!

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.230
Wait, Guy!

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.070
Pakkun!

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.670
Naruto!

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.130
Can I ask you something?

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.670
Since when have you been targeted by the Akatsuki?

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.500
I don't know...

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.300
There was that one time when two people from the Akatsuki

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.770
came to the Leaf Village in order to make contact with Naruto.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.630
But that was three years ago...

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.800
and they've just started making a move now.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.600
I don't know why.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.000
Why did they wait three years?

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.170
It could be that it's not because they didn't want to,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.870
but because they couldn't.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.830
Because Lord Jiraiya was always hanging close to Naruto...

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.930
No...

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.100
Based on information I acquired, there apparently is another reason.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.730
Another...reason?

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.170
There's quite a bit of preparation involved

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.800
if one's gonna draw out the Tailed Beast that's sealed within people.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.630
They encountered difficulties with that.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.200
What's this "Tailed Beast" that you were talking about?

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.600
What?!

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.570
You're Tsunade's disciple and you don't even know that?!

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.930
The Leaf Village had a Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit...

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.130
The Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit is

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.570
treated as top secret amongst the Leaf Village...

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.270
Well, that's not surprising, I guess...

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.870
A Tailed Beast refers to Beast Spirits with tails.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.330
Long, long ago, the Sand had a One-Tail.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.200
That's the Shukaku sealed within Gaara.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.600
One-Tail?

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.100
Do you mean that there are other beasts

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.470
besides the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit?

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.630
That's right...

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.000
There are a total of nine tailed beasts in this world...

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.200
Tailed beasts have special characteristics.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.270
Each of them have a different number of tails.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.600
The One-Tailed has one tail. The Two-Tailed has two.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.670
And up to the Nine-Tailed as the name suggests,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.570
each name represents the number of tails the beast has.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.030
The Tailed beasts have immense Chakra

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.400
and in the world of Ninja,

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.400
they were used for military purposes by Hidden Villages around the world.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.070
They competed to get their hands on them.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.100
But no one was able to control that power

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.370
which surpassed human intelligence.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.570
I don't know why the Akatsuki is after it,

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.330
but that power is too dangerous...

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:01.630
But in this new peaceful age, the Tailed beasts apparently...

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.500
still exist, having scattered all around the world...

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.600
Kakashi directed us, the Eight Ninja Hounds,

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.670
to fan out in every direction

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.070
to follow the Akatsuki Organization's scent.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.370
While we were doing that, we realized that

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.530
those guys were headed towards the Land of Rivers

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.170
which is situated between the Leaf and Sand.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.970
The Land of Rivers...?

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.670
That's right.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.430
In other words,

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.570
you guys are closest to the Akatsuki at this point in time.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.270
You, who were heading from the Leaf to the Sand Village.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.730
I see...

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.600
Follow me... I'll explain the details as we run.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.730
All right! Let's go, everybody!

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.430
Huh? Already?

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.400
An enemy is nearing this hideout.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.630
An enemy, you said?

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.730
And a highly skilled one at that.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.200
His name is...Might Guy.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.570
Who's that?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.670
A Leaf Jonin Ninja who uses Taijutsu.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.700
He's one clever operator. Don't underestimate him.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.800
Ah...that freak beast, huh...

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.230
We will use that Jutsu...

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.770
In that case, I'll go...

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:15.900
I was getting irritated for not having any luck finding a Jinchuriki.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.900
No, I'll go...

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.600
I have something of a personal quarrel with him, you see...

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.130
You're right. That Jutsu is more suited to someone like you.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.070
Among the Akatsuki,

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.030
you are more heavily loaded with Chakra, Kisame.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.570
Yes... Even so, I'll take 30% of your Chakra.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.000
Well, well, well...

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.530
It looks like I'll finally be able to get pay back

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.500
for that kick he gave me...

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.530
Severe Leaf Hurricane!

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.770
Who the heck is he?

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:05.370
The Noble Blue Beast of the Leaf Village... Mighty Guy.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.970
What's up?!

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.700
Someone's coming!

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.270
Byakugan!

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.300
Behind us!

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.070
You...

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.570
Do you know him, Guy Sensei?!

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.770
Who are you?

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.870
Another guest...

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.270
It's a little noisy this time, isn't it, Deidara!

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.130
Well, the Jinchuriki was stronger than the other two...

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.270
I told you at the start, didn't I?

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.500
Your Jutsu wasn't suited for covert operations.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:51.330
I'd say your traps were pretty loud too, weren't they?

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.530
What!

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.030
Stop fighting amongst yourselves!

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.970
Concentrate on the Jutsu!

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.600
Now then... who should I send this time...

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.330
This time it's my turn, without any doubt.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.570
Another Leaf Shinobi...

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.400
Damn!

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.330
In that case, it's decided...

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.370
Everybody, halt!

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.330
Who is that?

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.300
Out of the blue, huh...

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.400
That guy...those eyes...

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.430
You're...

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.500
This guy...has a ridiculous amount of Chakra.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.000
I've never seen anyone besides Naruto with that amount of Chakra.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.700
That much...?

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.230
Are you really saying you don't remember...?

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.000
Don't tell me you're...!

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.630
It appears that you've remembered...

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.570
Have we met before?

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.230
It looks like the freak beast's intelligence

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.970
is at the level of a beast too...

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:29.700
Well...I'll make you remember soon...

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.970
Itachi...Uchiha!

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.030
Th-That guy is...

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.600
That guy is...Itachi...Uchiha!

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.700
Guy Sensei, what is that?!

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.530
Lee, that is what we've been waiting for!

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.300
Then that is what all the surfers long for,

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.370
the legendary big wave that arrives only once every few years...?!

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.400
Big Thursday! Go, Lee!

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.600
Now is your chance to conquer that big wave

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:54.970
and become a man!

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.130
Yes, sir!

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.730
Please watch Guy Sensei, I'll prove to you my fighting spirit!

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.300
Will you two stop talking like that already?!

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.300
