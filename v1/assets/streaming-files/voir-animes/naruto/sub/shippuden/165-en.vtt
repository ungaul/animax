WEBVTT

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.370
What is that?

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.530
That's…

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.660
Guy's Eight Inner Gates attack… Hirudora!

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.330
Hirudora? That's a lame name for a jutsu.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.490
Considering Guy Sensei's obsession with youth.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.280
There's no time to nitpick!

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.660
The Hirudora has a wide blast radius, and it hits instantly.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.280
Brace yourselves!

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.280
Don't move.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.490
That jutsu… It wasn't an Energy Bomb, was it?

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.410
And your blue aura…

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.200
Hirudora is not a chakra-based ninjutsu.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.830
It is taijutsu.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.200
It's just an ordinary punch, but it's a super fast punch.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.240
A focused thrust of air pressure right at your opponent.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.870
That compresses and spreads in an instant.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.780
And this aura that envelops me is not chakra…

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.240
Those who open the Seventh Gate of Shock,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.580
perspire blue sweat!

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.370
That's what I'm evaporating with my hot-blooded passion.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.240
I thought that looked too small to be an Energy Bomb.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.200
This is my third time fighting you.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.780
But you still had something like this up your sleeve.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.450
You probably don't remember me.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.700
I thought I told you not to move.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.280
The Man Named Kisame

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.740
I got to hand it to Bushier Brow Sensei

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.200
for bringing this guy down!

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.780
You're capable despite your thick looks, Bushier Brows…

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.080
But that blue sweat of yours, packs some pows.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.200
If this goes well, I'll be able to extract Intel

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.990
about Akatsuki and its plans, as well as the identity of its leader.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.700
I'm not as good as Inoichi, but I'll give it a try.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.410
Here I go.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.660
Now then…

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.240
Here comes the hard part…

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.120
Hoshigaki…

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.200
Won't you eat with us?

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.200
There's no need to be nice to me.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.030
Hey, you heard him. Just leave him alone!

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.370
He doesn't like to rub shoulders with Cipher Corps eggheads like us.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.490
We're on a joint mission.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.410
Things like that don't matter!

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.280
Besides, we wouldn't have anything to talk about.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.950
We're the brains. He's the brawn.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.700
W-What's the big idea?

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.990
We need to set out immediately.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.330
Hoshigaki…

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.660
About earlier… How about after the mission?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.280
About having dinner.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.240
Now listen, Kisame.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.910
Guard the Cipher Corps and protect the encoded missive.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.200
However, you must not allow our any member

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.330
of the Cipher Corps to fall into enemy hands.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.120
Your mission is to guard the code, whatever it takes.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.580
Do you understand what that means?

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.530
Run!

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.530
Surrender! You're completely surrounded.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.870
There's no way you can win.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.620
I know you.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.410
You're that brilliant guy from

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.950
the Leaf Anbu's Torture and Interrogation Corps…

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.870
Want to fight?

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.910
Now's our chance. Run !

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.990
Capture them alive!

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.330
There are just too many to protect.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.780
Keep going! Do not stop!

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.910
Help me…

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.780
What are you doing?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.280
Hoshigaki, what do we do?

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.700
Hoshigaki?

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.410
W-What are you doing?!

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.740
However…

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.410
You must not allow any member of the Cipher Corps

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.240
to fall into enemy hands.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.200
Your mission is to guard the code, whatever it takes.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.160
Do you understand what that means?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.240
Yes, I do.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.660
I shall not hand over any of the Cipher Corps shinobi alive.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.240
Why?

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.240
Because killing my comrades is my special mission.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.450
What a terrible life…

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.530
Your comrades…why?

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.740
Why?

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.240
You, of all people, should understand.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.080
We cannot let our code fall into enemy hands.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.160
Besides, they would have talked right away.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.910
If we both survive, let's meet again.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.580
Kisame… You…!

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.530
Good work, Kisame.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.700
I had a feeling he would let his guard down with his subordinate.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.450
And I was right.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.370
He was collaborating with the enemy.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.080
From this moment on,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.370
you are the master of the great blade, Samehada.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.160
And my subordinate as well.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:52.370
That is, until you eliminate me too, Lord Fourth Mizukage.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.530
I can trust you because of who you are.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.410
You have executed dirty missions for

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.380
the sake of the nation and village.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.660
You've undertaken missions of betrayal.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.160
You are well aware that this world is full of lies and deceit.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:14.370
I knew that from the first moment I killed a comrade.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.410
Killing a Hidden Mist ninja despite being one myself.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.830
So what am I?

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.410
Am I an enemy or an ally?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.830
What is my purpose? Where do I stand in this world?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.910
Where must I go? And where can I go to find inner calm?

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.240
There is one thing that is clear to me…

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.780
I am trapped in a false existence.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.490
Then I shall release you from the pain of those falsehoods.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.240
I will create a place where you belong.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.120
Who are you?

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.580
First, we'll start with this nation.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.740
You have toiled to dispose of your comrades up until now.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.120
From now on, work with me as my comrade.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.990
You seem to have trust in me.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.370
But I still don't know who you are.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.280
Those eyes… that gleam in the dark!

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.450
I see…

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.870
The one I thought was the Fourth Mizukage…

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.200
was actually you.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.080
To think the Fourth was being manipulated by the Sharingan.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.910
This world really is full of lies.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.660
You have the visual prowess to be able to control the Fourth…

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.200
who is also the Jinchuriki of the Three Tails.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.910
Just who are you?

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.950
I am…Madara Uchiha.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.330
He is supposed to be dead.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.410
I don't believe you.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.530
Show yourself.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.580
Fine.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.830
You can decide whether to trust me or not.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.120
I'll find out who Madara really is!

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.580
His tongue… He bit off his own tongue!

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.700
He woke himself up to prevent me from extracting Intel.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.120
Are you serious?

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.370
Yes… That is my plan… Project Tsuki no Me.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.780
That is a true world free of lies.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.410
I needed to get in there.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.660
I was using my Wood Style to suppress his chakra,

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.200
but he still has so much power left.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.220
He just doesn't know when to give up.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.970
Capture him alive!

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.120
We'll never have another chance like this!

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.330
I want to extract more Intel from him!

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.530
I know that!

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.530
Water Prison Jutsu!

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.280
I can't reach him because of this wall of water!

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.280
It's the guy with the Water Prison Jutsu!

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.280
Summoning Jutsu!

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:43.990
What do we do?

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.410
No need to panic.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.580
Even if he is who he is, look at the situation he's in.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.580
He can't do anything.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.410
I'll get him!

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.950
Itachi… It's just like you said.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.620
I'll be teaming up with you from now on.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.530
I'm Kisame Hoshigaki, formerly of the Hidden Mist,

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.120
and an ex-member of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.870
Pleased to meet you.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.870
And you are Itachi Uchiha, formerly of the Hidden Leaf.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.240
I've heard the rumors…

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.240
You slaughtered all of your fellow Uchiha clansmen.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.530
I understand you well.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.700
That's the reason why I decided to team up with you in Akatsuki.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.370
The sensation that comes from killing your comrade

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.530
is indescribable, isn't it, Itachi?

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.120
You talk a lot.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.700
You may know a lot about me, but what about yourself?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.450
You got lost in the mist and ended up here.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.330
You're just a thug who couldn't figure out where to go.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.080
Isn't that so?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.580
Do you want to know something interesting?

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.370
Some sharks are ovoviviparous which means

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:23.370
the eggs hatch inside the female's body, then are born.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.280
However, with some kinds of sharks, the numbers of eggs that hatch

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.030
don't match up with the number of pups born.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.280
Do you know why?

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.280
Cannibalism.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.370
When the eggs hatch, the pups resort

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.700
to cannibalizing their siblings in the mother's belly.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.910
From the moment they are born, the fratricide begins.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.780
Other than itself, every other pup is fodder.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.410
From today, you and I belong to Akatsuki.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.870
Please be wary…

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.330
of me.

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:14.990
That goes for you too.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.200
Anyway, let's have fun together.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.200
And hope that we're not the last two facing each other.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.780
Anyone who has raised their hand against a comrade,

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.780
even once, never dies a decent death.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.160
Remember that.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.280
Which means you and I are both worthless.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.830
No…

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.330
We aren't fish, we're human.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.410
No matter who you are… you do not know what kind of human you are until the very end.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.280
you do not know what kind of human you are until the very end.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.780
One realizes their true nature at the moment of death.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.280
That's the way to view death.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.620
Itachi…

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.200
Did you realize the kind of person you were…

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.370
at the moment of your death?

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.370
Itachi…

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:20.580
It seems I wasn't such… a worthless human, after all.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.620
Feeding yourself to the shark you just summoned…

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.870
He was already quite weak.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.740
He figured out that he couldn't escape us.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.370
The Akatsuki member who was paired up with Itachi himself…

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.580
The one who was feared as the scourge of the Hidden Mist.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.490
It's hard to believe this is the way Kisame Hoshigaki met his end.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.870
Is he really dead?

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.120
This fella's downhearted

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.120
Looks like it's for real this time.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.370
The guy's already departed.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.450
But…

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.160
He did this so that we, his enemy, wouldn't get any Intel.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.620
Even in the Akatsuki,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.700
there was someone who put his comrades first.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.660
He may have been a foe, but he died admirably.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.330
The measure of a shinobi's life is determined

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.120
by the manner of his death.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.950
Kisame Hoshigaki!

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.870
I will never forget you!

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.280
In any case, no Intel was leaked to the Akatsuki.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.370
He intended to put down Intel about us onto this scroll

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.950
and get out of here.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.990
Let's check the contents of the scroll.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.620
If we know what kind of data he was after,

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.330
it will make counter-intelligence easier.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.280
You're right.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.910
The water is so heavy… This is the Water Prison Jutsu!

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.450
It was a booby trap!

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.830
Watch out!

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.330
Sharks!

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.700
Damn, it's making its way towards the ocean!

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.200
The water pressure is making it hard to move!

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.280
Fools, ya fool!

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.240
I used up all my strength on the Eight Inner Gates…

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.700
Guy, hang in there!

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.870
Watch where you're biting!

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.450
Damn it! It's getting away!

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.160
What do we do?!

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.490
Just as Yahiko believed in Nagato,

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.990
Nagato believed in Naruto.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:47.280
Since he is carrying on their wishes, I will believe in Naruto.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:53.200
If you're telling me to sever those feelings, I will…

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.620
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Angelic Herald of Death"

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.700
I will kill you!

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.370
Tune in again!
