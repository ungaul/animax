WEBVTT

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.030
Why did she do such a thing?

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.900
Hinata...

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.170
You love Naruto?

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.030
Naruto was able to suppress the Nine-Tails on his own.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.870
On his own?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
He is about to confront the last Pain.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.270
Lee.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.030
We are going to assist Naruto!

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.100
Right!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.630
Please don't.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.200
You will only be in his way.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.400
But look what they did to this village.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.800
He can't manage alone!

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.400
Naruto seems to have a plan.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.600
Let us have faith in him.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.670
Someone like you who has no answer...

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.130
should just give up!

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.630
He withstood it... Impossible!

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.500
That jutsu cannot be thrown.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.900
I have five seconds.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.400
This distance will work for me.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.400
Give up...

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.230
...on me giving up!

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.700
Rasengan!

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.530
Nagato...

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.030
The last Pain has been crushed.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.010
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.100
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.520
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.440
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.240
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.540
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.750
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.380
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:32.010
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.010
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.180
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.400
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.900
koete Someday...

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.370
The Two Students

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.500
Pain operated by receiving chakra through these sticks.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.630
Once it's taken out,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.700
he shouldn't be able to move anymore.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.770
You and I seek the same thing.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.700
We are trying to establish the peace that Jiraiya Sensei so desired.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.830
You and I are not different at all.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.870
We each act according to our own sense of justice.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.300
You have your own justice... and I have mine.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.470
Have you come to understand a little of what pain is?

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.430
Unless you know the same pain, you cannot truly know another.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.230
And even if you get to know others,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.570
there can be no understanding.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.130
A cycle of hatred begins.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.400
That is history as we know it.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.400
So we cannot help but believe

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.970
that human beings are incapable of understanding each other.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.400
The world of the ninja is ruled by hatred.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.900
You're going?

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.400
Yeah.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.730
Then this time, use reinforcements.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.900
No.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.000
I'm going alone!

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.370
Lady Hinata!

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.700
Everyone... Thank goodness! We were so worried.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.870
Are you okay, Lady Hinata?

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.830
Thank you, everyone.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.870
Thank you, Sakura.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.230
I'm so relieved. You overdid yourself this time.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.070
Everyone, Naruto defeated the sixth Pain.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.430
Way to go Naruto!

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.400
How is Naruto? Is he hurt?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.300
He's exhausted, but otherwise okay.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:48.530
Thank goodness... Naruto, I'm so glad.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.030
So, where is Naruto?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.230
He's going alone to where the real Pain is.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.530
Why would he do something like that?!

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.900
Guy Sensei! We must follow!

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.270
Yes!

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.500
However... Naruto does not want assistance.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.400
Wh-What?!

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.000
No! Naruto's done enough on his own!

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.900
He's considerably weakened.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.430
Please lead us to Naruto!

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.100
What is it?

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.230
It's Naruto...

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:33.930
Naruto!

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.600
Guys...

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.300
The fact that you're here...

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.700
Does it mean that you've defeated the sixth Pain?

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.930
It doesn't matter who won or lost.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.030
What happened?

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.570
I can't really put it into words.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.930
What do you mean... you can't put it into words?

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:22.170
Look, I'm going to see the real Pain.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.200
Please don't follow. I want to go alone.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.870
Naruto, you know where the real Pain is?!

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.270
Yeah... I found Pain's body through Sage Mode

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:51.130
and when I pulled out the black rod, I felt his chakra.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.770
I see. But you want to go alone?

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.800
What's going on?

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.600
I want to confirm something.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.270
Confirm? What is it?

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.700
I want to talk to the real Pain.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.800
What?! You're talking nonsense!

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.170
We're all grateful that you've defeated Pain.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.900
But it's far too late to settle things with words!

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.870
Then tell me!

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.800
If we destroy the real Pain, and his minions,

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.030
and the village and everything else connected to the enemy,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.670
will that "settle" things?!

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.700
What good will talking do?

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.830
He is our enemy who destroyed the Leaf Village!

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.830
We cannot forgive him!

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.100
I know! I know! I feel the same way!

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.800
How can I forgive a guy like that

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.230
who did this to our village and its people?!

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.170
- Then... - Inoichi...

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.530
Let's do as Naruto says and let him go alone.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.630
Shikaku...

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.530
It is Naruto who stopped Pain.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.370
He has every right to speak to Pain.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.270
Besides, I'm sure he has his reasons.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.670
But... Just let him go.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.200
Thanks, Mister Shikaku.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.600
Why did you let Naruto go by himself, Shikaku?

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.930
It's my son...

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.400
Your son?

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.500
Where were you?

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.670
Black Ops sent a message for you.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.430
Well... I went to lecture Naruto...

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.200
to stop him from acting glum.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.330
It was a pain, but I couldn't help myself.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.470
He's got something that we don't have.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.130
"Something"?

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:10.930
Yeah... Someday, he's going to become a very important ninja to this village.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:20.470
When I'm with Naruto... he makes me want to follow him.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.670
Shikamaru, who rarely praises people, said that to me.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.430
There really must be something special about Naruto.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:32.930
I want to believe so.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.470
Let's put our faith in Naruto.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.930
Konan, get back.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.700
But Nagato...

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.300
It's all right.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.630
Are you the real Pain?

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.500
So peace has stumbled onto me.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.270
Do you hate me?

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.800
You're facing the object of your vendetta...

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.030
Do you wish to exact revenge?

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.970
A cycle of hatred begins.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:26.430
I formed the Akatsuki in order to stop this cycle of hatred.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.100
Nothing in this world will change

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:35.100
even if you kill Pain now and inflict your revenge.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.630
All it will be is self-satisfaction.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.830
This monster known as hate will not die

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.970
while there is a system of ninja.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.030
It will give birth to more Pains.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.830
To be a ninja is to confront hatred.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.730
Each and every one of us battles hatred.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:01.970
Jiraiya Sensei trusted you to find a way to end this hatred.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.100
If you could not find the answer,

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.500
then there is nothing you can do,

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.230
but to do the just thing and sacrifice yourself

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.100
for the peace which I am about to create.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.100
At this close distance,

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.400
I can easily control your movements with my chakra.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.330
Rest assured. I've avoided hitting your vital spots.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.500
For you are invaluable, Jinchuriki.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.200
What's wrong, Nagato?

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.030
He...purposely didn't move.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.570
I came here... intending to talk to you.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.700
But, I also wanted to confirm something.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.270
Confirm...something?

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.330
I wanted to confirm my feelings.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.800
If I stood before my enemy... what would I do?

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.000
I wasn't sure of myself.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.270
And?

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.970
I can't forgive you!

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.970
Even now, I want to kill you so badly...

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.730
I can't stop shaking!

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:12.130
What? He can resist Nagato's chakra up close like this?!

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:31.200
Even I can see there's too much hate in our Ninja World.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.030
And I've wanted to do something about this hatred,

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.600
yet I'm not sure what must be done.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.130
I'm glad I made you my student.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.070
Pervy Sage said he believed that the day would come

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.600
when people can truly understand one another.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:07.930
I wasn't paying much attention when he told me that...

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.430
Even when he said he'd entrust me with finding the answer.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.430
I got excited, taking it as a sign

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.370
that he acknowledged me as his student.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.100
Thinking back...

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.830
I finally understand what Pervy Sage meant.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.130
That it's not so simple.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:31.100
Still, it doesn't change the fact that you can't forgive me.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.470
Words of forgiveness come easy.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.030
Love does not.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.770
Yeah... You're right about that.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.800
Jiraiya Sensei's words reflect an idealism from an era long past.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.930
It is far removed from reality.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.930
Didn't you say you would kill me

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.370
and bring peace to the Ninja World?

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:06.030
Even if you seek vengeance for your own satisfaction,

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.570
if that is your idea of justice, so be it.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.100
You're not a god.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.530
After witnessing this harsh reality,

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:20.670
do you really still believe Jiraiya Sensei's silly ramblings?

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.470
When I found out you were Pervy Sage's student,

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.500
I wanted to ask you one thing.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.500
What is it?

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.230
How could the Pervy Sage's students turn out the way you did?

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.600
I understand that you're not like the Akatsuki members

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.630
who kill out of sheer enjoyment.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:48.670
But I don't know a thing about you guys.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.930
That's why...

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.200
I want to hear your stories, then come up with an answer.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.070
Very well...

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.830
We will tell you about our pain.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:16.350
When the fireworks suddenly explode in the air...
fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.850
I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face...
muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:31.070
sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly...

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:46.920
It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you...
kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:53.300
Because I always remember you, in situations like this...
kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto

00:20:53.660 --> 00:21:00.430
I can't help but think about the times we spent together.
mata omoidashiteshimau yo

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:09.900
I'm ready to forget you...
mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:14.030
It just tears at my heart too much.
konna ni mo kanashikute

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:21.200
I wonder... why did we meet each other?

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:24.960
doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes...

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:33.250
me wo tojireba It's like you are here.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:33.250
ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.630
Did you hear, Sakura?

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.130
The next Naruto Shippuden is about an untold tale

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.470
that takes place back when we were kids!

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.730
Team 7 goes on a great adventure

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:47.630
in search of the Fourth Hokage's legacy.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.670
You definitely have to see this one!

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.430
Check out all our action!

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.630
And Sasuke's heroics!

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.630
Don't miss out on it!

00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:00.570
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Big Adventure! The Quest for the Fourth Hokage's Legacy - Part 1"

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.470
Now go, young challengers!

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:10.370
Master, I heard you used to change your age and appearance

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.000
as you travelled around.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.530
As a young kid... as a lovesick adolescent, and such.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.200
Wow...

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.270
I'm interested to know what you looked like in your youth, Lady Tsunade.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.970
Oh, me too!

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.370
Hmm... Very well then!

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.800
Well? Pretty charming, don't you think?

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:34.630
Huh?

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.800
Wh-What's with you two?!

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.500
I-Is there something you want to say?

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.270
Wh-Wh-What?

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.500
- That... - Turns into that?!

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.870
Lady Tsunade! What was your diet like during adolescence?

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.730
And any other secrets you have!

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.170
- Tell us already! - Tell us already!

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.870
Cut it out!

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.230
Tune in again!
