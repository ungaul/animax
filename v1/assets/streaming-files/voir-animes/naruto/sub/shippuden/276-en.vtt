WEBVTT

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.020
The vermin traitor has finally died, eh?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.810
He was vermin… and persistent as a cockroach.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.030
Don't laugh at Obito!

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.740
Naruto…

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.450
Naruto… If you keep resisting,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.210
you'll end up pitifully crumbling to ash just like him!

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.210
As someone who tried to become Hokage, Obito is…

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.430
…nothing but awesome to me!

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.930
No way!

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.190
I can't move!

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.400
I don't even have much strength left,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240
and yet, I was left behind again?

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.960
Are you all right, Rin? Kakashi?

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.050
Obito!

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.100
Don't…

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.940
It's okay, Kakashi.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.230
I don't think I can make it…

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.990
My right side is totally crushed.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.160
I can't even feel anything…

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.410
Damn it!

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.250
I'm giving you my Sharingan.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.550
Whatever the village may say… you are…a great jonin.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.100
That's how I really feel…

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.980
So please accept it.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.740
Kakashi…

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.190
– Rin! – Rin!

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.740
Again, you…

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.240
Thank you, Rin.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.740
Obito and I will be joining you shortly.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.410
We can catch up then, the three of us together…

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.710
Rin…

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.340
This time, let's…

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.010
spend some alone time together. Just you and me…

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.140
Kakashi would just be in the way.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.810
I'll leave him here.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.650
This is…Kamui!

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.740
Obito! You!

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.330
Kakashi… you stay here a little while longer.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.080
Don't you rush to follow us!

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.220
Why, Obito?

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.930
What am I even here for?

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.340
THE SHARINGAN REVIVED

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.350
This is embarrassing… Screwing up like that in front of you.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.480
It looks like you've calmed down a bit.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.360
Okay, Obito.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.660
Rin, do you mind waiting just a bit longer?

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.160
Obito?

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.830
Only a little bit before we move on…

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.670
I'd like to make one more detour along the way.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.090
Who do you want to save this time?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.430
Kakashi.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.180
I've finally gotten alone time with you.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.140
It'll be wasted if he ends up coming here right away.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.310
Besides… He's out there helpless.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.570
Just like his namesake, he's a scarecrow in the middle of a garden…

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.530
And I'm sort of annoyed by it.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.200
Despite all that's happened, you two are still close, huh?

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.700
N-No way!

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.210
We're oil and water!

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.210
So?

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.580
You can go just like that?

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.750
Yeah…

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.380
Chakra is an energy that connects two worlds.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.630
I'm gonna go see Kakashi!

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.760
I'll be waiting right here.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.890
Sorry, Rin! I'll be right back!

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.280
Obito?!

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.870
Before I go to the next world, I thought I'd emphasize to you…

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.160
to not to come running after me so quickly.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.710
Besides, it's going to keep bothering me

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.210
if this eye I gave you to celebrate your promotion to jonin,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.760
came back to me.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.800
Obito, you…

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.890
Then again, it's not like I'll be springing back to life anymore.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.970
More importantly,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.440
you know how I told Naruto to become Hokage?

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.940
I meant to say as the Seventh.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.820
You be the Sixth Hokage, Kakashi.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.700
I know you haven't taken office yet, but I'm giving you your gift now.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.250
It has a fixed time limit, but it isn't useless.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.870
Do you get what I'm saying?

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.170
I mean…you haven't forgotten your famous nickname

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.750
that's known throughout the lands, have you?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.720
That name, Kakashi of the Sharingan!

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.110
Let's do this, guys!

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.160
Mmhm.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.740
Yes!

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.290
Yup!

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.870
All right!

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.420
Roger.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.130
Sure thing!

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.840
Gotcha!

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.210
Yeah!

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.550
Here we go!

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.430
Sage Art: Super Tailed Beast Rasen-Shuriken!

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.490
Nice, Naruto!

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.290
There's no way they can come out of that unscathed.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.760
Oh no! Don't tell me Mother's—!

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.680
What's that?

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.030
She turned into another gigantic thing?

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.280
What is that?

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.660
A wolf? Tanuki?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.740
Badger? Or a rabbit?

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.200
It doesn't matter. Now it's easier to get close.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.830
And it'll be easier to seal her!

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.590
It's not…humanoid?

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.380
Mother didn't transform into Ten Tails of her own will.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.220
Are the Tailed Beasts within her resonating

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.220
in response to Naruto's attack and starting to split apart?

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.140
They're not stable!

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.190
Sasuke, don't get grabbed by that white hand!

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.280
It will absorb you instantly!

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.240
And it's fast too!

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.320
I know that!

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.120
Sasuke!

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.250
Protect Sakura with your Visual Prowess!

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.590
All right, way to go!

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.890
A Susano'o?! Whose was it?

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.390
W-What? That wasn't you?!

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.810
What's going on?!

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.230
Kakashi Sensei!

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.900
Thank you…Obito.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.240
That's impossible. No way!

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.120
Sure it is!

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.790
We are talking about the Copy Ninja, Kakashi of the Sharingan!

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.500
But he shouldn't have the Sharingan anymore…

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.500
I don't get it, but he saved me!

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.670
You watch along with me.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.720
This time, I'll protect them…

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.140
and the world!

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.950
Here it comes!

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.370
How about this?

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.080
Combining the power of the Kamui into… shuriken!

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.330
Kamui Shuriken!

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.470
Just as I thought…

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.600
Gaining Six Path's power enhances one's Visual Prowess too!

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.150
This power… It's Obito's Sharingan?

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.480
But why does Kakashi Sensei have it?

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.360
Wow!

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.530
That's more amazing than yours, Sasuke!

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.780
This chakra is—!

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.160
This Root Time-Space is Mother's exclusive domain,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.040
where she can directly extract chakra

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.000
from shinobi trapped in the Infinite Tsukuyomi!

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.300
The Tailed Beasts are now stable,

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.130
and Mother has even produced a Truthseeker Orb…

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.930
An Expansive Kekkei Moura Truthseeker Orb

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.180
that contains each and every nature…

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.470
Wind, fire, earth, lightning, water, shadow, and light.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.190
It is the beginning of a new Time-Space.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.360
And you all will become its sacrifice!

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.360
That thing!

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.120
It's the same sphere as the one behind me!

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.990
The difference in size is too drastic!

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.700
And it's growing rapidly!

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.210
I definitely can't teleport away such a gigantic object with the Kamui.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.960
Even if we get out of this Time-Space and escape temporarily…

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:54.010
If that thing becomes too big, we won't be able to return here.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.180
In order to stop that…

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.730
We need to seal that Rabbit Granny away right now!

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.850
You're right.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.350
Gather 'round. I've got a plan.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:10.530
This will be our last mission as the former Squad 7!

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.290
We're going to save the world!

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.750
Yeah!
Roger!

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.790
I am immortal.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.840
If either of you die, you cannot seal me away.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.300
Now then...

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.430
Which shall it be?

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.230
You're mine, damn it!

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.140
No, we attack her together.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.690
She's scared of being sealed and her attention will be divided!

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.230
Take me part of the way. Then I'll fly the rest of the way.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:51.980
Right!

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.450
So fast!

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.290
Mother just gained more power.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.880
Both her power and speed are now exponentially greater!

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.730
Being able to pass through things, really is a handy ability, Obito…

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.280
And now, I can resurrect this move too!

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.990
Kamui Lightning Blade!

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.160
Mother!

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.540
This is bad! Her right arm!

00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.760
There's not enough time to escape into another Time-Space!

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.010
Then!

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:21.530
So they were both Ashura's reincarnates, after all.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.200
They must have, switched back then.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.910
So then, the one on the right is the real one!

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.380
Kamui!

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.780
Not good.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.500
I'll go to the Ice World… No…

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.460
The Indra reincarnate possesses the Amaterasu…

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.170
That wouldn't be good!

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.300
Don't forget about me! We're both women…

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.090
so don't mock me!

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.310
Naruto…Sasuke…Sakura!

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.540
A silly prank…

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.250
Still, if this prank was the result of teamwork…

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.880
He fell for it!

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.840
So Naruto's the perp.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.220
I'm so sorry, Sensei. I tried to stop him, but Naruto…

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.390
Sakura makes excuses and tries to protect herself.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.220
Sasuke minds his own business.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.690
He probably doesn't consider them comrades.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.940
There's not a shred of teamwork…

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.730
How do I put this…

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.940
My first impression of you guys is not good!

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.780
I'll go! I'll go!

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.030
I'm Naruto Uzumaki! I love instant ramen.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.210
But I love the ramen at Ichiraku that Iruka Sensei treats me to even more!

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.170
And I hate having to wait three minutes after pouring in the hot water.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.380
My future dream is…

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.880
to surpass the Hokage!

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.340
And that's why

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.340
I'm going to make everyone in the village acknowledge me!

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.350
My name is Sasuke Uchiha.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.850
I have lots of dislikes, but no likes in particular.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.190
And I don't feel like summing up my ambition as just a dream,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.520
but I do have an ambition.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.860
The ambition to restore my clan and to kill a certain man without fail!

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.370
I'm Sakura Haruno.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.330
What I like… I mean, who I like is…

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.000
My future dream is…

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.600
They're all wrapped up in themselves.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.220
They're far from working together as a team.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.360
Although we were just like that…

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.320
Oh well, I'll just have to do what I can.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.250
Yup… You guys make a pretty picture right now.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:56.830
Now!

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.750
Cha!

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.380
All right!

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.300
I really love you guys!

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.150
We finally made it out!

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.320
Kurama! Your Jinchuriki sure gets it done!

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.030
Now it's happily ever after!

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.450
Yeah!

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.030
Hold on a sec! What about us?

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.660
How are we supposed to get out of this Time-Space?

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.660
Oh, you're right!

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.790
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Congratulations"

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.880
But…he's still pretty dumb, isn't he?

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:18.850
CONGRATULATIONS Tune in again!
