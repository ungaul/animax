WEBVTT

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.600
They should be getting there soon.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.730
Are you talking about Naruto?

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.100
Yes.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.230
The Raikage wouldn't disclose the exact location,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.000
but he did say it was the ideal place to lay low.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.630
If only Naruto will do as he's told and stay hidden.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.330
Knowing his personality,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.100
once he finds out that war has broken out,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.400
he'll want to rush out onto the battlefield.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.670
I told Naruto that he was going

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.770
on a highly classified S-rank mission.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.900
I'm sure the others will follow along and play their parts.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.900
Octopus, octopus, octopus!

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.900
Octopus?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.130
An octopus is supposed to help guide me.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.930
Remember? Giant Gramps Sage foretold it.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.430
Listen, Naruto… I have seen a prophecy involving you.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.830
You will soon be meeting an octopus.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.500
Where is this octopus? Can't you give more clues?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170
It's not clear, but it's an isolated island.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.000
People don't go near it.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.870
It's like a paradise for creatures.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.200
To me, it looks like it would be a fun resort.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.700
And there, the octopus should be of help to you.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.770
In any case, you will find your way.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.230
That's right, it was an octopus.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.530
He was right about this being an isolated island paradise.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.700
I'm sure there's no mistake about meeting someone to guide me.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.930
Naruto hasn't figured it out yet.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.330
Please start preparing to disembark soon.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.030
Oh, I can see the island!

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.570
No kidding!

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.200
An…island paradise?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.130
It's like the Hidden Leaf's Forest of Death.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.570
But this is a bit more extreme.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.170
This is a resort?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.470
Don't worry it's safe.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.170
As long as we don't provoke them, the creatures are quite docile.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.500
Except for one… "Except for one" what?

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.200
What part of this place is a paradise?!

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.370
You're a fool, Giant Gramps Sage!

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.630
For one that lives along the shore…

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.270
Huh? Octopus tentacles!

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.800
Okay, octopus! Come and guide me!

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.700
Naruto, this is actually…

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.500
a squid!

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.570
Land Ahoy! Is this the Island of Paradise?

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.230
It's here!

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.370
I was just about to warn you that he's the one

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.170
you have to be careful about, but he appeared before I could!

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.230
– What?! – What?!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.570
One, two, three…

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.630
It's obvious without counting its tentacles!

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.130
Naruto, come on!

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.130
But we should make sure.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.230
A squid has ten legs. An octopus has eight.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.000
If this is the octopus who's going to help guide me…

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.300
Naruto?!

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.500
Squid go deviate… The rest I abbreviate!

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.300
What the—?!

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Here comes another one saying weird puns!

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.200
This is so confusing!

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.030
6, 7, 8… It's an octopus!

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.870
This one is an octopus!

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.600
Is that really an octopus?

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.970
Master Killer Bee!

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.300
Killer Bee?

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.000
Then this octopus is…

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.670
Y'all are late, ya fools, ya fools!

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.200
It changed into a human?

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.970
Hey, ya know Octopops, thanks!

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.600
Ya know…

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.600
RHYME NOTEBOOK

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.570
What?

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.500
KILLER BEE THAT'S ME…YA KNOW!

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.970
Will we clash or be a smash?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.470
If I dare say, it'll be a no-go, whee!

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.000
I'm a brat-hatin' outlaw…

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.930
What's up with this beefy guy in shades,

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.900
singing lame puns at the top of his lungs?

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.400
Is this geezer the octopus who's going to guide me?

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.330
They're not puns.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.870
It's his original style,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.500
a combination of Enka singing to a rap beat. Enka Rap!

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.530
Enka rap?

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.470
Welcome, everyone! I've been waiting for you.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.470
I am Supervisor Motoi and I'll take care of your needs.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.300
I'll take you to your lodgings, so please follow me.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.470
Oh, we're finally here?

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.900
We're standing on solid ground, Guy.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.200
Get a hold of yourself!

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.830
Is Bushier Brow Sensei all right?

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.670
He never got over his seasickness, did he?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.970
We were at sea for a long time.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.870
It sure was long. It sure was painful.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.000
Is this really a paradise?

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.000
I still feel woozy.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.370
Hey, King, no need to panic!

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.000
These guys are okay.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.900
It's a gorilla! A gorilla!

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.270
Is this a gorilla?

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.930
Master Bee stands at the top of this island's hierarchy of beasts.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.970
He's tamed them all.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.170
So as long as he is around, it's safe here.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.870
Furthermore, preeminent Hidden Cloud shinobi

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.670
maintain a barrier around the island.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.500
We'll know immediately if anyone suspicious approaches.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.500
Which is why this place was chosen to detain them.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.130
Who the heck is that shades-wearing pops?

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.300
He is the Hidden Cloud's hero among heroes.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.570
Hero?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
He's someone who not only tamed these wild animals,

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.800
he is a Jinchuriki who can control Tailed Beasts.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.800
He is a Jinchuriki like you… of Eight Tails.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.670
The Eight Tails' Jinchuriki?

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.530
And he can control it?

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.230
That old guy?

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.470
He's Master Killer Bee.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:08.570
Yo!

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.170
This island is also where he trained

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.500
to gain control over the Eight Tails.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.470
The Hidden Leaf can use this floor.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.500
There are ample rooms.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.430
Eat all you want

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.870
in the great dining hall on the first floor.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.770
Choose whatever rooms you want.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.770
We'll adjourn until the meeting tomorrow morning at seven.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.830
I'm going to rest for awhile.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.770
This island is also where he trained

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.730
to gain control over the Eight Tails.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.970
And there, the octopus should be of help to you.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.830
Ahh, it's the "ya know" brat.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.930
What's up?

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.430
You want an autograph from me?

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.870
Train me!

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.430
Train you?

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.800
I'm the Jinchuriki of the Nine Tails.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.970
But I can't control it yet.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.670
So please teach me how to control a Tailed Beast.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.430
No way.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.670
I came here because my brother, the Raikage,

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.670
ordered me to take a vacation…

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.470
Why should I give up a rare vacation for that reason?

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.400
Ya fool, ya fool!

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.400
Because we're both Jinchuriki!

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.100
Why won't you help me out?

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.770
Your big attitude is suspect.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.870
And now you're trying to change the subject. Whee.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.230
Old man, your shades are so hip.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.770
And your facial features are so thick, but you're just so sick. Whee!

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.700
Hey kid, you've got good style.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.170
Yes! He's starting to like me!

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.900
Yo!

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.770
First comes the greeting!

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.730
We start with fist bumps, while we keep rapping.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.170
Hey fuddy-duddy… Those shades sure look funny, ah…

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.000
Shouldn't have said that!

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.470
Oh well, what the heck!

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.930
Harem Jutsu!

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.370
I've been begging for so long on my knees.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.000
Come on, my dear.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.130
Teach me control.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.870
Please…

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.870
How's that?

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.430
All men fall for this jutsu!

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.100
Hey old man! Old man!

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.400
You're stingy!

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.930
What's with that guy?!

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.830
All he does is talk in rhymes.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.670
Whoever heard of an octopus that raps?!

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.100
What do you want?

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.870
Show me how the old man wearing shades

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.900
trained to control the Eight Tails.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.930
He trained here, right?

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.100
Oh, you're talking about Bee.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.630
He won't give me the time of day, so I came to ask you instead!

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.330
Me?

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.500
I don't care if he's the hero of the Hidden Cloud or what…

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.800
He's stingy and stubborn, and talks only in rhymes.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.600
We're both Jinchuriki,

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.330
so why can't he be more understanding?

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.430
– I mean… – What do you know about Bee?!

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.470
If you keep complaining about him,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.900
I won't forgive you, kid!

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.670
If you're a Jinchuriki,

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.300
you can imagine the kind of life he's had to lead, can't you?

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.370
I sure can!

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.300
And that old man should be able to imagine what it's like for me!

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.270
So why won't he give me a break when I need his help?

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.430
Even I…

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.200
Bee has been watching you all along.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.400
There's a reason for his actions.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.500
Did you introduce yourself to Bee?

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.330
Introduce?

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.130
First comes the greeting.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.570
We start with fist bumps.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.270
We did…fist bumps.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.870
Okay. Naruto, right? Follow me.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.770
I'll take you to Bee's training spot.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.300
All right!

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.730
Then I'll join you.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.230
Captain Yamato?!

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.600
I'm a Wood-Style user and if something happens,

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.100
I'm supposed to look after him.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.500
Oh? You're the Wood Style user.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.070
Fine then.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.330
Here's some water.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.530
Oh, thanks.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.530
Still not feeling good?

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.430
Well, I feel like I'm recovering.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.830
But I can't shake the feeling that I'm still at sea.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.770
Could it just be my imagination?

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.170
Yes. It's just your imagination.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.230
Is this the place?

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.830
Yeah. This spot is known as the Waterfall of Truth.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.530
The Waterfall of Truth?

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.330
He learned to control the Tailed Beast here?

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.170
No, it's the first step.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.430
Sit here and close your eyes, Naruto.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.230
You will see your true self.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.430
My true self?

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.670
Yes.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.070
Why?

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.630
Why didn't you give them your autograph at Ichiraku?

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.930
What?

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.970
Those guys suddenly got nice

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.700
and tried to get friendly with you, huh?

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.300
They were disgusting, weren't they?

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.270
This guy looks just like me!

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:17.270
Everyone in the village used to treat us like lepers.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.130
Oh hey! Give me your autograph, Naruto!

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.630
And address it to my kid. He's a big fan of yours.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.800
Autograph?

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.500
The hero of the Hidden Leaf…

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.370
The youth who created a miracle, Naruto Uzumaki.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.170
Can I have one too? What is it? You refuse?

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.270
Oh no, but I'm not used to that sort of thing.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.400
I don't even have a signature.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.100
Who are you?

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.200
Can't you tell? I'm you.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.330
I don't remember doing Shadow Clones.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.900
I'm the real you.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:03.300
The real you that exists deep inside your heart.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.100
What are you saying?!

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.100
I don't know you. Stop making stuff up!

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.200
Naruto, hey… Quiet!

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.200
This place is called the Waterfall of Truth, right?

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.430
I never figured I'd be able to come out like this.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.430
What a great place.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.470
Anyway, I'm your true self.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.130
The real you.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.800
The real me?

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.730
Yeah. I'm the precious hatred inside you.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.170
The dark part of you!

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.230
The only difference is…

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.670
the Nine Tails has taken a real liking to me.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.430
You…

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.270
The Nine Tails' will is a mass of hatred

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.230
that binds itself tightly to chakra.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.100
No matter how hard you try to shield yourself,

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.670
it will find some hatred that you have buried deep inside

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.670
and try to take you over.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.200
Until now, the Nine Tails and this guy…

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.000
You got that right.

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:18.470
I'm the real one. You can't kick me out, you fake!

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.830
Is that how it is?

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.600
You're the fake one!

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.930
Come on anytime.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.830
On this island, I'm top dog.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.670
Taking y'all down Like a whirlwind clearing the fog.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.030
You still have a ways to go, Kintoki.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.700
Hey Bee…

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.570
If you had time to play around,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.230
why couldn't you have taken a look at the Nine Tails' kid?

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.530
You're both Jinchuriki, why not give him a break?

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.270
I don't like Nine Tails myself, but that kid has promise.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.400
I was a confused mess back then,

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.370
but I met you and look at me now.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.700
He sort of reminds me of you.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.970
My style is rap And I say shut yer trap!

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.570
I ain't acknowledgin' no rap-mockin' "Ya know" fool

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.100
Besides, he…

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.230
Damn it!

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.100
Our strength is identical.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.200
There's no end to fighting him.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.900
You can't beat me. Never.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.300
Then I'll put my bet on numbers!

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.270
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.830
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.400
What the hell?! Is that how it is?!

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.270
Even the numbers of Shadow Clones are the same!

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.230
You're pretty smart, figuring that out.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.100
Damn it!

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.200
Go!

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.030
Go!

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.630
What is going on?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.500
When you sit before the waterfall and focus,

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.600
you are able enter your subconscious.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.230
And the waterfall becomes the mirror

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.600
that reflects your true self.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.300
It is really a mystical place.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.870
Right now, Naruto is battling his other self.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.030
– Rasen… – …gan!

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.400
Naruto, are you all right?!

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.200
What happened?

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.870
Someone exactly like me appeared.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.900
And he…

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.530
What is it?

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.470
He was my dark self.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.600
We're evenly matched and

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.100
he keeps attacking with the same strength as me.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.370
Our jutsu, our fighting style, everything is identical.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.000
It's an endless battle!

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.670
How can that be?

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.470
You must defeat him

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.570
or you will not be able to control the Tailed Beast's power.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.300
I told you.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.000
The Waterfall of Truth is just the first step.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.430
Bee and I used to be friends.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.330
Well then, can you ask the Octopops

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.670
for training hints on my behalf, Motoi?

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.970
I can't do that.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.030
Why not?

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.230
I am not worthy of such an errand.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.630
I once tried to…

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.300
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Killer Bee and Motoi"

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.500
I wonder what happened between these two?

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.500
Tune in again!
