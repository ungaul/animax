Tales of a Gutsy Ninja - Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls - Part 1

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.930
There are two bells...

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.600
The fact that there are only two bells means...

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.670
One person will lose...

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.870
You're very sharp, Orochimaru.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.470
Say! If I get a bell, you'll go out with me.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.770
If you lose, don't bother me anymore.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.470
All right! I'll do it!

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.370
So many openings...

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.570
Now!

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.870
I won the bet, Jiraiya! You get to go to the log.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.400
Shut up, flat-chested plywood Tsunade!

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.430
What'd you say?! You egg-headed perv!!

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.400
Now, now. That's enough...

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.930
Tsunade and Orochimaru may go.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.700
Okay!

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.000
You are hopeless...

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.270
How can a ninja keep falling into such obvious traps?!

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.330
Can't help it...

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.270
Perhaps what you lack is a purpose...

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.470
Huh?!

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.630
Let's see now...

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.000
Yes! We'll try this!

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.330
Wh-What?!

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.800
Don't get so excited. Just watch.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.400
Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.730
Awesome!

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.900
The Summoning Jutsu...

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.500
You make a blood contract with an animal,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.870
and summon them at any time using the Transportation Technique.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.870
I want to make a contract with that one too!

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.670
That, you can't do.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.670
Huh?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.900
In the same way that every man is destined to a different fate,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.730
so too is the animal to whom he is intertwined.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.500
Then which is my animal?

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.630
Before you can make a contract,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.430
you need to be more adept at molding chakra and sealing.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.300
What? Not more training!

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.670
You will always find the answer in your training!

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.070
Jiraiya had found a purpose and from that day on,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.800
he began taking his training seriously. However...

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.200
Mold more chakra...

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.870
Study up on sealing...

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.370
I must master the Transportation Technique...

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.670
Dammit!

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.300
When will I be able to make a contract?

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.000
Why do I put up with this rough training?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.770
If I were to have a boyfriend,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.400
I'd choose Orochimaru over an egghead perv like you.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.870
The answer is simple!

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.400
I just have to become the ultimate ninja

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.970
and sweep Tsunade off her feet!

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.030
Now that that's settled, there's no time to waste!

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.800
Ah...

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.130
So he's discovered his purpose for becoming a ninja.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.300
And not just Tsunade,

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.330
I'm gonna get all the pretty girls to myself.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.530
Let's see... Concentrate my chakra and...

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.330
the seal is boar, dog, bird, monkey, sheep...

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.530
Wait! There's no telling what will happen

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.670
if you use the Transportation Technique without making a contract first!

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.330
Go!

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.600
Where am I...?

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.930
Hold it right there!

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.100
I, the great Master Jiraiya, shall take over this fight!

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.800
Heh! I guess that'll do!

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.430
Hmmm...

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.570
A human child.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.100
Huh?! A-A talking toad!

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.830
And what about you?

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.130
To think, a human would really come to Mount Myoboku...

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.730
What do you mean?!

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.930
Lord Fukasaku!

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500
It's a human child.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.100
Oh...so you've arrived.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.730
You talk as though you've been expecting me.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.770
Yes, I knew you were coming. The Great Lord Elder predicted it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.270
A human child will stumble into Mount Myoboku,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.530
and I will give that child the power of the toad and a prophecy.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.870
That is the dream which I dreamt of myself...

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.930
My very own prophecy.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.770
If that human is me... then what is my prophecy?!

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.300
Well... I don't know.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.030
Don't know?

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.970
You must stay here and train,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.800
and wait for the Great Lord Elder's prophecy.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.630
H-Hold it!

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.570
I made up my mind to become strong

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.100
so that I'll be popular with women...

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.230
There's no point in getting popular with frogs!

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.000
Quit complaining! This is your destiny.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.700
My destiny?!

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.570
Yes. You managed to come to Mount Myoboku.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.200
This is proof that you were indeed the chosen one.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.170
The chosen one, eh?

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.370
Training here and becoming strong... That's pretty tempting too.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.400
From this day forward, Jiraiya divided his time between

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.630
Mount Myoboku, the land of toads, and the Hidden Leaf Village...

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.870
He spent the days of his youth in both Sage and ninjutsu training.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.530
However...

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.030
It was not to be as simple as Jiraiya had thought.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.270
I've definitely gotten stronger since coming here.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.600
But...

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.800
Tsunade is as cold as ever.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.000
Not just that...

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.570
If I was destined to be the chosen one,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.070
should my purpose simply be to impress a girl?

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.630
Is that the only reason why I'm trying to become strong?

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.800
Jiraiya! Jiraiya!

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:29.030
Yeah?

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.070
Jiraiya, the Great Lord Elder has summoned you.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.200
The Great Lord Elder...?

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.170
Hurry up. He has seen your prophecy!

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.300
For real, Bunta?!

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.400
As summoned.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.430
Ah, good. I'm glad you've come!

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.730
Huh?

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.070
Who're you again?

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.330
Great Lord Elder, it's Jiraiya! This is Jiraiya!

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:04.400
Oh, that's right! Right! My, how you've grown...

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.730
Gah, you're the one who summoned him, ya great senile old geezer!

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:09.970
Senile old geezer?!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.030
Ma, how dare ya call the Great Lord Elder a senile old geezer!

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.470
Now now, let's not fight. Spouses oughta get along...

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.770
By the way... Who're you, again?

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.030
Jiraiya-boy.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.800
The Great Lord Elder had a dream about you.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.430
As you are aware, it is a prophecy.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.230
So listen carefully.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.570
Yes, sir!

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.130
I shall now tell you. In my dream...

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:52.130
you, who are solely pervy, will still manage to become a splendid ninja.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.870
And in time, you will have your own disciple...

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.830
Solely pervy...?

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.030
Can't believe he remembers that particular detail...

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.330
That disciple will become a ninja who will bring about a great change

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.630
to the ninja world.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.900
That is what I saw in my dream.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.470
A great change?

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.100
Either great stability or great destruction.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.600
The likes of which this world has never seen before.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.900
One of those two.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.070
One of those two? What does that mean?

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.670
You will guide that revolutionary.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.130
The day will come when you will be forced to make a critical selection.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.230
Selection?

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:42.930
Your choice shall decide which way the change goes.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
What must I do...? In order to make the right choice?

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.000
In my dream, you traveled the world, writing books.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.770
Books? Whatever for?

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.070
I do not know either.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.930
Perhaps it will be a journey around the world

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.330
to see all things in nature.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.400
Great Lord Elder, have your prophecies ever not come to pass?

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.870
No, never.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.070
Jiraiya, you are leaving?

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.070
Yup!

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.870
At this point in my life,

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.170
there's no way I can guide someone who will be a revolutionary...

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.570
Let alone make the right choice.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.700
Hmm...

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.900
I guess I need more time to see many more things,

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.370
and meet different people.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.730
I see...

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.870
Just like in the Great Lord Elder's dream,

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.730
I shall journey throughout the world and perhaps, write a book.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.830
It seems that is my destiny.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.100
While Jiraiya journeyed and searched for the meaning

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.100
behind the Great Lord Elder's dream,

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.200
the state of the world grew steadily more chaotic.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.170
The peace that had prevailed among the Five Great Nations became fragile.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.070
Aggression between lands increased as did internal strife,

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.900
and the people began to suffer.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.030
Young man... Why are you traveling?

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.830
I'm searching for my destiny.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.000
Oh...?

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.930
Someone saw me in a dream.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.830
And just like in that dream, I journey from land to land.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.070
Oh my, what's the matter...?

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.600
Here, have one. It's milk candy.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.600
A puppet?

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:57.600
Oh, this child tells me... Destiny is not something you search for!

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.970
Destiny is something you latch onto when it presents itself.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.000
The age of war is coming.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.630
Mechanical skills are useless in times of peace,

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.900
but some feudal lord may pay a high price for my services.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.030
So he is a ninja too...

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.400
He has chosen to ride the wave to the age of destruction.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.070
But that will only...

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.300
Let's have more fun.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.600
Come on.
Mmmm...

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.130
What are you writing?

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.930
Just scribbling... that riding on the wave of the times

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:38.630
will not result in the revolutionary change needed for peace.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.170
Say, say! If you're gonna change something, change me!

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.700
I suppose you're right. That does sound more fun.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.130
This is fraud!

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.400
As if I'll pay for something like this!

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.530
Hold it right there!

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.170
I shall take over this fight!

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.670
Damn it!

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.470
How can fate be so cruel?!

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.900
I worked hard on cultivating the land with what little knowledge I had.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.770
All for the sake of my clan, and yet...

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.130
So this fellow is dissatisfied with the way the world is going...

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.270
Have a drink...

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.930
I've been searching for my destiny too, but it's very elusive.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.130
Humph... It's useless to search for something like that.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.300
My people have no chance

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.900
against the ninja villages of the Great Nations...

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.830
This guy... Is that all he can do...complain?

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.570
You are wrong... Huh?

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.970
I teach children in a village...

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:45.170
about how to fight back when faced with a harsh fate.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.400
So education could end a war?

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.200
Cut the pretty talk!

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.670
What?!

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.770
Is he a ninja too?

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.900
No, that it cannot...

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.400
However, perhaps I can teach them skills

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.270
that enable them to make better choices.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.270
Let me ask you... What are those choices?

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.400
Life or death... Those are the choices.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:16.030
The only thing I can teach them is how to survive.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.000
That's not good enough.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:26.430
I must choose the revolutionary who will bring peace to the world.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.370
To bring destruction upon this world.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.430
Or to bring about a peace which we have never known before...

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.330
That depends on the commitment of each and every person!

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.170
Hmm... Could this person be...?

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.570
Say, you!

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.900
You just might be the person I've been looking for!

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.070
Oh...?

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.300
What would you do in order to bring peace to this world?

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.700
The world is heading towards an age of war and strife...

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.500
There's no stopping it.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.230
You just said it depends on each person's commitment, didn't you?

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.500
How do we change these people's destinies?

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.330
Just pray hard. That is all men can do.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.930
This man is not the one...either.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200
What was that?!

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.430
This is just an ordinary village! Why would a ninja...?!

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.630
This shuriken jutsu...

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.230
You are from the Fuma, aren't you?!

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.130
Why attack people who are living in peace?!

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.930
You are also a ninja.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.630
I am journeying in search of the one who will become my disciple.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.470
Humph! Why waste time on such a tedious thing?!

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.970
The balance of power between lands has become shaky

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.430
and we are on the verge of a great war...

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:31.530
That village was also destroyed due to a tip that ninja had infiltrated it.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.800
Just because of a tip?!

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.330
It's destroy, or be destroyed.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.430
We live in a world where you'll die if you hesitate!

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.700
A Smoke Bomb!

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.570
You're pretty good.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:59.230
If you are a ninja too, I cannot let you live.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.870
Just give up... This is our fate as ninja.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.070
Can I say something?

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.100
I don't feel like listening...

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.500
Just...die!!

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.430
Give up...

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.170
...on me giving up!

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.730
Even if you bring me down,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.930
another assassin will attack the village...

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.100
As long as we are cursed to live in this ninja world,

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.100
there will be no peace.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.630
The Great Toad Sage's prophecy said that I am destined

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:45.030
to train the revolutionary who will bring peace to this world.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.100
However, I haven't even encountered this disciple.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.730
Already at this time, battles were inevitably being fought.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:02.330
Jiraiya was also forced to take a short break from his journey

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.900
and returned to the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.870
We're at war...after all.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.570
Orochimaru...

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.700
In order to erase this sadness from the ninja world...

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.300
I must find the revolutionary...

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.230
I must choose the one who will bring peace.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:48.870
The flames of war finally drew in Jiraiya and his comrades.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:54.570
This would come to be known as the Third Great Ninja War.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:59.200
Shortly afterwards, the three would come to be known

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.670
as the "Legendary Sannin."

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:41.250
Boy, it's not easy coming up with ideas for writing a book.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.720
The main hero of this book has seen too much of the ninja world,

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.320
where battle brings further battle.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.250
It's a world filled with hate.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.280
I want him to somehow wipe away the hate

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.520
and create a world of peace, yet...

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.550
Aaah! It's so hard to build up a story to the climax!

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.850
What shall I do?!

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:04.820
Next time: "Tales of a Gutsy Ninja - Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls - Part 2"

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.480
Tune in again!
