WEBVTT

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.900
So... How is Naruto's training going?

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.370
Well, according to Kakashi Sensei,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.170
it seems like he got a hold of something.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.570
He said it's gonna take a little longer to complete...

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.430
I see...

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.230
Now that Kakashi Sensei has joined Team Ten,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.070
Team Seven...our team, should support them

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.270
because of our close alliance with them...right?

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.630
You're sharp...just as expected...

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.100
But, we don't know when Naruto will complete his new Jutsu.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.570
Wouldn't it be better to send another team?

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.230
Sakura!

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.100
Tell Yamato...

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.270
To have Naruto complete his new Jutsu in 24 hours!

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.600
If not, I will send another team as reinforcements!

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.930
Yes!

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.030
Shizune, look at the schedule

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.670
and put together a list of teams that can go support Team Ten

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.230
in case Naruto does not complete it in time.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.070
I got it.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.670
So, it's starting.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.670
Shikamaru... Let's hear your plan first.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.670
Now that you have joined, I want to change the plan a bit.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.930
I got it. Please explain.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.600
I will explain by dividing it into several scenarios.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.070
Make sure all of you listen carefully.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.430
Target: Locked On

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.530
Huh? Kakashi Sensei and the others went after the Akatsuki?

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.400
They just left a minute ago...

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.330
I see... So what did Lady Tsunade say?

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.270
She said it's best that we go to support them...

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.530
But she also said that in order to do so,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.530
we must complete Naruto's new Jutsu immediately.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.800
Huh?! My new Jutsu?

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.670
If you don't complete it within 24 hours,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.030
then she's going to send another team.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.930
Within 24 hours, huh...

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.230
Naruto...?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.230
Oh! You shouldn't eat that...!

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.100
Huh?!

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.770
Naruto...

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.600
Captain Yamato, let's start the training!

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.800
Kakashi Sensei, take this...

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.470
please use it when there's an opening.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.070
I'll let you keep it.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.770
I got it.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.630
I'm impressed at how much you observed about your opponent

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.230
from just one encounter.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.100
But the other one's power is still unknown...

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.800
On top of that, you've readjusted the plan to fit the new member...

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.370
It's remarkable.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.900
That's the plan I developed with the limited information I had.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.800
After you memorize the plans,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.230
simulate them in your head three times or more.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.330
The success rate of the plan highly depends

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.100
on whether or not you do image training.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.400
Yes.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.630
Okay!

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.000
Okay, let's go.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.270
Yes!

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.830
First, we need to find their trail.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.770
Trail...

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.370
I get it, you're saying we need to find the path

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.170
between the Temple of Fire and the Collection Office.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.470
You're saying we're going to find their footsteps and scent there.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.270
Well, I don't think that will be easy...

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.500
Let's hurry.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800
-Yeah. -Yes.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.930
The sealing of the Two-Tails is now complete...

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.630
There are now only four remaining... You are dismissed.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.470
Finally!

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.530
We're going to Hidden Leaf Village, Hidan.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.070
Hidden Leaf Village...?

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.800
Kakuzu, Hidan, if you are going to Hidden Leaf Village,

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.230
I will give you one warning...yes.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.430
There's a guy named Naruto Uzumaki who's a Jinchuriki.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.300
If you see him you should be careful...yes.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.000
Hey hey hey!

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.530
Don't assume I'm the same as you, Mr. Deidara!

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.870
You are the wuss who got his arms sewed back on by Kakuzu!

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.300
It's better than his head...

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.970
Hey! Hey, Kakuzu! Who's side are you on?!

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.900
Aren't we teammates?

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.670
- That's why you--! - Shut up Hidan!

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.070
Let's just go.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.700
I had to sit still for three days, I'm going to go crazy...

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.570
Wait for me, bounty.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.570
Hey, where are you going, Kakuzu? The Collection Office is this way!

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.100
Are you stupid?

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.770
What?!

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.970
Our target is the Jinchuriki.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.270
There is no need to go back to that place just to run into an ambush.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.300
Let's take a different route to the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.830
It has been three days.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.130
The Hidden Leaf Village should have retrieved that bounty by now.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.270
Well, that's right.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.130
Oh yeah...

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.300
What?!

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:48.400
That scar is embarrassing. Cover it up with this!

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.930
Hey! This is my Headband.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.730
Oh, you actually picked it up for me...?

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.200
Kakuzu! You're pretty nice!

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.600
Shut up Hidan! Hurry, let's go!

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:10.370
Oh! Hey! Wait a sec! Hey! Kakuzu!

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.430
Tell me the truth, you like me, right?

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.500
If you keep talking, I am going to kill you.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.100
Don't be shy...

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.300
As expected, the trail can't be found due to the rain.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.300
So, what are we going to do?

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.830
Either way, we can't do anything unless we find our enemy.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.530
I remember they said...

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.870
We'll be right back... Be prepared!

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.870
Stay still until we get back!

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:56.370
But obviously, they won't return to the same place.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.470
The second team should be monitoring the Collection Office...

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.730
The one that yells a lot is fine, but there's the other guy...

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.300
I bet they will use a different route,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.270
but they have only one destination.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.170
Whether they are going after Asuma's corpse for money

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.500
or they are after Naruto, their destination is Hidden Leaf Village!

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.070
Then that means, it'll be a wide search...

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.270
How are we going to find them?

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.900
We'll go with that.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600
Huh?!

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.500
Got it.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.100
I found them.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.170
There's no mistake...they're headed straight to Hidden Leaf Village.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.270
Shoot!

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.170
Are you all right, Ino?!

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.770
That was close!

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.070
Did they notice?!

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.570
I think it's okay.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.100
As expected, they're headed to Hidden Leaf Village through a different route.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.170
They're in the 2 o'clock direction. We will run into them in ten minutes.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.300
What happened, Kakuzu?!

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.070
Naw, nothing...

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.170
It's just my imagination...

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.600
Then let's hurry.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.470
Yeah...

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.530
All right. Let's go!

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.400
- Hidan... - Yeah...

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.970
- Damn it! - It's a Paper Bomb!

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.530
Kakuzu!

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.900
I hardened my arm. I'm not injured.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.470
Forget that, watch out for the shadow...

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.170
I won't fall for it twice!

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.500
Hidan, look up!

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.870
It's another Paper Bomb!

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.230
Hidan, dodge it!

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.170
It didn't explode?!

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.670
They got us...

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.500
Shadow Possession Shuriken Jutsu... A success.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.370
I can't move.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.170
You bastard... I dodged the shadow, so how did you...

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.970
The thing I threw is a Chakra Blade.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:58.500
I bet you know that it's made from a special metal

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.200
that absorbs the user's Chakra characteristics.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.370
Kakuzu, what is he saying?

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.730
Idiot! Shut up, Hidan.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.870
Due to the Chakra absorbed,

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.700
it exhibits power based on the user's Jutsu.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.170
Basically, the Chakra Blade itself

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.100
is exhibiting my Shadow Possession Jutsu.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.200
That Chakra Blade is a memento of Asuma, the man you killed.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.130
35 million ryo, huh...?

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.230
Asuma...

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.300
If I were to equate Hidden Leaf Ninja to Shogi pieces,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.700
Shikamaru... In the end, you would be a knight.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.130
Why?

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.400
Although weak in strength, a knight can advance

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.800
by jumping over pieces...

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:52.070
Its unique movement resembles your flexible thinking.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.100
I see... This Paper Bomb is a fake. It's just paper...

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.400
His aim was this Chakra Blade from the beginning...

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.500
Because of that, the first Kunai Knife with the Paper Bomb

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:21.430
was a diversion to ensure that we'd dodge the second Chakra Blade.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.330
Furthermore, he used his shadow...

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.870
to make us focus our attention on our feet.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.700
He did it to make us realize his attack from above and

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.830
make us dodge it at the last minute

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.900
in order to ensure that he could grab hold of our shadows.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.770
He's pretty clever.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.500
Well, let's finish this.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.270
Hey! Why the hell have you been so quiet?!

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.370
What are you doing getting caught, too?!

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.270
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.030
To tell the truth, aren't we pretty screwed?!

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.070
Screwed?

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.700
According to my plan,

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.270
it was finished from the moment I caught you.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.500
You did a good job...

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.830
You bastard...

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.730
Damn it! What are you doing?!

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.070
There's no way I'm gonna miss the second time.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.770
I'm going to corner you guys.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.370
You jerks went after us in the wrong order.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.870
I'm not going to mess up the order this time.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:21.670
Damn it!

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.630
I know your face now!

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.430
No matter what happens to me, I'm gonna kill you.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.470
You're stupid, aren't you?

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.600
Kakuzu! Dodge it!

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:18.830
All right!

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.330
What's happening?

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.200
I didn't expect his arm to move on its own

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.630
after being separated from his body...

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.970
But when did this happen?

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.500
It was when I attacked with the paper bomb!

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.030
While he was in the smoke, he put this right arm in the ground...

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.730
Just what I'd expect of the Akatsuki.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.430
They all use insane abilities!

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.230
You said we were finished,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.430
but my powers are still unknown to you.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.930
So you kept your distance when you made your next move.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.070
You're intelligent, unlike my partner.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.030
But even if you analyze the fight,

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.970
it doesn't mean everything will go as planned.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.430
Kakuzu! What do mean "unlike my partner"?

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.030
Just as I said, you idiot.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.330
Damn it! My body...!

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.430
Kakuzu, do something!

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.000
I can't believe you're forcing me back.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:43.870
Shoot!

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.270
Now, Choji!

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.430
Spiky Human Boulder!

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.900
Kakuzu!

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.870
What's the meaning of this?

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.270
Why? He got hit by Kakashi Sensei's attack!

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.500
Yeah, you're right. We definitely crushed his heart...

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:52.100
What's with his back? I sense some very bad Chakra.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.130
It's finally a serious situation.

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.370
- Be careful, Choji. - Got it!

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.500
Either way, that Kakuzu guy seems like he has a lot to share.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.300
