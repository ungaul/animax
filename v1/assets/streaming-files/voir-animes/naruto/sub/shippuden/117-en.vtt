WEBVTT

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.970
So here you are.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.530
Naruto-boy, every once in a while, you disappear.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.770
Where do you go?

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.900
Well...nowhere in particular. I just wander around...

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.470
Well, no matter.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.470
I want to practice merging starting now, so come down here.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.630
I wonder if they're okay.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.200
What do you mean?

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.970
The Akatsuki want me, right?

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.400
I'm worried they will come looking for me in the Leaf Village.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.830
What kind of fool are you?!

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.000
The Hidden Leaf has many fine ninjas!

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.000
Stop your unnecessary musings and concentrate on the work at hand!

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.970
If anything happens, the messenger frog will notify us.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.770
All right!

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.730
Let's get on with this merging stuff!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.130
Who could have imagined such destruction?

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.990
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.080
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.500
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.420
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.220
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.520
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.730
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.360
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:25.990
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.990
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.160
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.380
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.880
koete Someday...

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.250
Mystery of Pain

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.320
This spells the end of Tsunade's era.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.180
However, we cannot allow the Akatsuki to take Nine-Tails.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.550
So I have eliminated that possibility.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.420
We will lay low underground until the chaos dies down.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.020
Shouldn't we be assisting?

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.880
Even if you should assume power, it would be meaningless

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.920
if the citizens of the Hidden Leaf are dead.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.020
The princess is now Hokage.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.620
As long as she can utilize Katsuyu's jutsu,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.950
the entire village will not perish.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.980
Certainly, there will be lives lost.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.150
But to me, that is a necessary sacrifice.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.080
In order for me to become the Hokage...

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.950
I win!

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.280
Nothing tastes better than a drink of sake after work.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.850
No good.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.520
Did you find out anything, Tonbo?

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.750
Not yet... Nothing promising that is linked to Pain.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.180
NO TRESPASSING

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.720
Today's corpse is light.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.680
It's a knack I got from years of experience.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.880
This one's a woman.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.720
The highest tower in the village where we always deliver these bodies...

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.580
You know what that's for?

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.480
In a village like ours,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.620
isn't it usually where the ashes are enshrined?

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.420
They were originally built as a memorial to honor the dead.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.220
If that's the case,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.520
why is it off-limits to the relatives of the dead too?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.120
Like I care.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.850
What? Stop acting arrogant.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.320
Actually... Rumor has it that Lord Pain lives up there.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.520
Really? That's something.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.680
But there's no way.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.420
It's just a rumor. A rumor...

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.480
Never mind that. I'm gonna confirm it.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.020
Just like you said. It's a woman.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.120
Good work.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.980
Oh, Lady Angel...

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.780
Now quickly, bring the next one.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.920
Inoichi is really amazing!

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.850
He can see half this guy's day in a mere 30 seconds...

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.220
I can barely keep up!

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.380
You fool!

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.850
If you have time to talk,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.280
find something that we can link to Pain!

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.480
Sorry for interrupting.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.650
It's me, Shizune!

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.850
Lady Hokage ordered me to come here!

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.220
Did you learn anything on your side?

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.350
Yes! I will explain immediately!

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.180
The information I brought, along with the data you possess,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.420
will reveal Pain's identity!

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.150
Summoning Jutsu!

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.250
Each of the Pains had black rods like this one

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.680
inserted in their bodies.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.420
We believe this is the key to explaining their power.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.480
Could it be that they use this to transmit chakra to each other?

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.650
It's a similar ability to our clan's Hidden Jutsu.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.320
The forefather of all ninja,

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.780
the Sage of the Six Paths, possessed the legendary Rinnegan.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.650
Someone who possesses the same eye...

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.420
If such a person really does exist,

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.420
then it wouldn't be a surprise, no matter what jutsu he uses.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.950
What was that?!

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.450
It seems they have shown up here as well.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.350
We will stop them.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.780
Wind Style: Wind Blade Jutsu!

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.920
Lightning Style: Four-Pillar Trap!

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.320
Earth Style...

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.420
Buta Futa!

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.720
Well? Did we do it?

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.320
All right! This completes the steps to Sage Mode...

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.150
We'll now begin the merge training!

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.850
Y-Yeah...!

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.580
So basically, you're gonna get on my shoulder, right?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.850
Correct.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.380
While you move, I draw in Nature Energy.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.580
This is a training to hone that combination.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.520
Now then, let us synchronize our breathing.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.420
Okay...

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.780
A-Are you okay, old frog?

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.620
S-Strange...

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.850
Let's try it once more.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.280
Sage Art: Amphibian Jutsu!

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.980
It seems this is not possible.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.680
Not possible...?!

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:17.120
I suspect that the Nine-Tails inside you is rejecting me.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.020
No way!

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.720
Then what was all that training for?!

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.250
What are we gonna do?!

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.950
What?!

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.320
This beast...is growing more heads!

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.450
Looks like a special type of Summoning.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.580
Rather than fighting the beast,

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.880
let's find the one casting the jutsu!

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.050
What should we do, Lady Shizune?

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.750
As for them...

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.420
Summoning Jutsu!

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.480
Wh-What is that?!

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.980
As I thought...

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.280
It's here.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.050
It seems I made it in time.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.250
Lady Katsuyu, thank you so much!

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:06.150
Yikes! Forgive me, Lady Katsuyu, I'm just not used to you yet.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.320
It's quite all right.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.120
They are powerful Summonings.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.680
Everyone, please be careful.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.080
There's no mistake...

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.250
When I looked into the mind of that fellow from the Hidden Rain...

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.550
I saw her.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.380
But how could this be?!

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.250
What is it?

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.780
She was a corpse!

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.650
And that dead body... is now using a Summoning Jutsu!

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.750
It was thought each of the six Pains

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.750
uses only one type of jutsu.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.320
But something's wrong!

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.350
Lord Fukasaku said that the only one who was able

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.920
to use Summoning was the Pain we did the autopsy on!

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.120
What's going on?!

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.020
The Pain who was capable of the Summoning Jutsu

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.280
has already been killed by Lord Jiraiya!

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.650
Inoichi! Please give me more details.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.920
I might be able to figure this out!

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.150
But in our current situation...

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.850
Leave this place to the Anbu Black Ops and me.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.920
Get to safety!

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.220
Ibiki...!

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.680
Let's hurry, Inoichi!

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.920
We must uncover Pain's true identity!

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.180
We'll head to the Cipher Division for the time being.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:31.080
Have Ino accompany us to assist your jutsu.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:32.820
Got it...

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.580
It's me, Ino. Listen carefully.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.920
We are moving to the Cipher Division.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.550
Let's go!

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.780
We shall be your opponents!

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.080
Why don't you speak?! You're no fun at all.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.450
Humph! If that's your attitude,

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.080
then I shall make you want to speak!

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.280
We'll deal with the dog!

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.650
Combination B!

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.020
Right.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.420
Wind Style!

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.780
Wind Blade Jutsu!

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.120
Lightning Style!

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.220
Four-Pillar Trap!

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.880
Earth Style, Mud Fall!

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.020
Lightning Style! Sixteen-Pillar Trap!

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.020
Fire Style!

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.180
Biscuit Firing Jutsu!

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.220
Summoning!

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.520
Iron Maiden!

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.250
Summoning... Torture Chamber!

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.880
I'll loosen your mouth.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.620
And you'll tell us...your secrets.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.480
Pain... What a nice name.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.480
Pain is the most reliable form of communication.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.080
Let me feel your pain too...

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.420
Yes... Pain does not lie.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.580
Through pain, we are equals...

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.080
I will share your pain.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.220
And I will get to know you through pain.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.950
Now show me...the real you.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.380
Now...

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.080
This one...isn't feeling any pain.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.280
And...this cold...

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.220
It's like...a dead body!

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.080
Just what is this pain you speak of?

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.520
The likes of you would never understand true pain.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.180
Summoning Jutsu!

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.880
Summoning Jutsu!

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.680
Impossible...!

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.550
No, Konohamaru! Why didn't you run?!

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.920
I made a promise, long ago... What?

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.380
That someday, I would fight Brother Naruto

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.580
over the title of Hokage!

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.750
He is my rival!

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.250
So I'm not choosing an escape route!

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.620
Because Brother Naruto won't be waiting at the end of such a path!

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.220
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Surname is Sarutobi! Given Name, Konohamaru!"

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:01.620
Remember that!

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.980
The documents are piling up.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.650
Oh well, I have to cancel tonight's date.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.820
Yeah right... I don't even have a date!

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.380
Better get back to work...

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.620
NINJA REGISTRATION FORM Ninja Registration Form...

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.420
A lot of this hasn't been updated.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.150
Oh, wow!

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.080
They're all so young.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.080
These are photos from their Rookie Nine days.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.120
And look at them now, in just a few short years.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.050
Huh?!

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.280
My goodness... That child...

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.980
I have to ask Kenzo to retake it.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.950
Huh?!

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.820
Quit...copying such silly things!

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.020
Tune in again!
