WEBVTT

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.170
Okay. No problems.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.770
All right, you can leave the hospital today.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.130
By any chance,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.930
this isn't because you want me to hurry up

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.500
and take that baggage with me, is it?

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.700
Well, there's that, too...

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.370
That Naruto.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.630
He refuses to leave the hospital room

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.870
so he can be ready to start training at any moment...

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.570
Truthfully, I was going to start after kicking back.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.830
I mean, recuperating at home for a few days.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.470
But I've run out of books to read...

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.730
So I guess I'll just get right to the training.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.070
That's right... Rasen!

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.370
All right! I win.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.400
You have to treat me to a year's worth of Ichiraku Ramen.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.370
Wake up, Idiot Naruto!

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.470
Ugly... Huh?!

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.400
Sakura...

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.200
Wind

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.630
Okay, time for some training.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.900
What is it?

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.000
Well, it's been a long time since I've trained with you...

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.430
I don't really know why, but I'm glad...

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.630
I see.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.830
Laugh it up while you can.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.670
Time won't wait for us, so...

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.400
As I told you at the hospital,

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.730
the purpose of this training is to create a Ninjutsu

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.930
of ultimate power just for you.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.900
A Jutsu that will exceed the Rasengan.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.730
Two techniques, "Change in Chakra Nature"

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.430
and "Change in Chakra Form," are crucial for that...

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.230
Change in Chakra Form and Change in...Chakra Nature?

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.000
Okay, okay. You can't understand two things at once.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.170
I was wrong. Sorry about that.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.870
Then, first let's go with the explanation of Change in Chakra Form.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.100
Right!

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.370
Try making a Rasengan.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.530
Huh?

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.930
Sure.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.400
Let's go!

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.270
Right!

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.700
Rasengan!

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.300
Okay, stop!

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.870
You've already mastered the Change in Chakra Form.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.070
Your Rasengan has done that.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.100
R-Rasengan...

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.330
Spinning Chakra like mad at a super-high speed

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.430
and then compressing it...

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.070
This in itself is the Change in Chakra Form

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.500
and the Rasengan is a Jutsu that has carried that to the extreme.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.330
Then that means I've passed the Change in Chakra Form?

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.900
Yeah, that's about the size of it.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.670
Yahoo!

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.400
Okay, next is the Change in Chakra Nature.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.700
Right, right...

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.000
Let's see... Take Chidori for example...

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.370
This is a Jutsu activated by simultaneously creating

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.970
both the Change in Chakra Nature and Change in Chakra Form...

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.500
Watch this. I concentrate Chakra in my right hand...

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.330
I shift the property of this Chakra into electrical current.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.730
So this is the Change in Chakra Nature...

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.100
That's right.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.430
And now I shift the form so it will discharge electricity

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.970
and then I determine the range and strength of the attack.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.970
In order to learn a Jutsu above that of the Rasengan,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.770
this combination of the Change in Chakra Form

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.000
and Change in Chakra Nature

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.930
is absolutely necessary, like with the Chidori.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.070
Then I'll be able to complete a new Jutsu in a flash

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.470
if I add that Change in Chakra Nature to my Rasengan!

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.970
Listen. That's easier said than done.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.570
In the first place, you still haven't even learned Change in Chakra Nature.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.700
And you don't even know what Chakra Property you have, right?

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.570
Huh?! What Chakra Property?

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.370
Well, I figured I'd have to start explaining from there...

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.270
Listen up.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.100
Basically there are only five types of Chakra Properties.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.500
The five types are fire, wind, water, lightning and earth.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.330
These basic properties are the basis

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.200
for the names of the "Five Great Nations"

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.700
and they're also the foundations of all Ninjutsu.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.600
No kidding. Really...?

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.300
Everyone generally has Chakra that falls under one of these properties.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.730
For example, the Uchiha clan has the property of fire,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.130
and Fire Style Jutsu is their strength.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.330
Wind has the Wind Style. And lightning has the Lightning Style.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.170
Chidori is one type of Lightning Style Jutsu.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.630
So that means Sasuke has

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.500
the two properties of fire and lightning, huh...?

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.070
And you currently don't have any.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.000
Moreover, we don't know what type of Chakra Property you're good at.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.430
What's that?

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.800
I'll find that out with this strip of paper.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.570
How're you going to do that...?

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.570
The paper gets wrinkled if it's a lightning property.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.630
It'll get cut if it's wind.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.000
It'll burn if it's fire.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.830
It'll get wet if it's water.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.070
It'll crumble if it's earth.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.470
This is litmus paper that reacts easily to Chakra.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.070
It's made from a special tree that grows while absorbing Chakra.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.830
If you flow your Chakra into this paper,

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.100
you'll find out what property you have.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.330
All right...

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.270
Your Chakra property is wind.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.600
Wind...

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.430
It tears and cuts through all sorts of things.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.900
It's Chakra with outstanding battle strength.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.330
Ooh! I'm awesome!

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.730
No, you've still only just figured out your property...

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.230
Now at last, we've come to the training

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.830
for learning the Change in Chakra Nature for wind...

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:02.830
Right!

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.300
However, it will take an enormous amount of time to learn that technique.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:15.470
And so I hit upon a way to drastically reduce that time.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.700
Awesome!

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.970
And the way to do that is...

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.570
Captain Yamato!

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.430
Huh? Why, why?

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.200
Kakashi asked me to help out with this training.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.570
I'm sorry for interrupting you, Kakashi Senpai...

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.030
No problem...

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.530
- And you see... - Hey! Hey!

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.400
What type of Change in Chakra Nature is your Wood Style, Captain Yamato?

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.170
Huh?

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.970
Well...

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.770
Well, his interest has shifted that way,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.500
so just go ahead and tell him.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.830
Uh-huh...

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.500
Then...

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.770
Earth Style: Rampart of Flowing Soil

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.930
Whoa! What?!

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.870
Water Style: Waterfall Basin Jutsu!

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.600
He made a waterfall...

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.830
I have two Chakra Properties, earth and water.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.070
What?! You have two of them, Captain Yamato?!

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.430
Jonin-class Ninja generally have two or more.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.130
I've also got properties other than lightning that I can use.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.600
Then, Captain Yamato has

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.270
three properties including the Wood Style?

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.500
No, that isn't how it works.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.300
Huh?

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.830
I can only use earth and water.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.900
There is no fundamental property known as "wood" to begin with.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.300
Then how do you do it?

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.000
He does it simultaneously.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.600
He does the Change in Chakra Nature for earth and water at the same time

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.330
and generates the new wood property.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.430
Earth with my right hand...

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.470
and water with my left hand.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.870
That's awesome...

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.670
If you have two Chakra Properties...

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.400
it's not that difficult to use each one independently.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.870
But when it comes to generating

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.230
two Change in Chakra Natures at the same time...

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.030
it's a different story...

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.270
The power to generate a new Chakra Property

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.070
by using two Change in Chakra Natures simultaneously

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.300
is called the Kekkei Genkai.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.700
You've at least heard of that expression, haven't you?

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.500
Yeah...

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.970
That boy you once fought named Haku used it

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.330
He was able to use the Kekkei Genkai known as the Ice Style...

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.830
But he generated "ice" by using

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.800
the two Change in Chakra Natures of wind and water at the same time.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.830
It's a special Jutsu

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.670
only those from a clan possessing the Kekkei Genkai can use.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.400
Haku, too, huh...?

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.070
So I couldn't copy it even with my Sharingan...

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.770
No kidding...

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.770
Then what about Shikamaru's Shadow Possession Jutsu

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.730
or Choji's Expansion Jutsu?

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.530
And what about Medical Ninjutsu and Genjutsu?

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.000
Hmm, an explanation of that stuff would take a while

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.000
and you'll just get confused if I tell you all at once...

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.000
Kakashi Senpai...

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:46.300
Why don't you save the yin and yang of Change in Chakra Nature for another time?

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.270
Yin? And Yang? What's that?

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.230
Right.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.030
You wouldn't understand even if I told you now.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.600
Now, what were we talking about again?

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.870
Oh... Something about how to totally cheat on training time...

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.230
Reduce the time.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.500
Yeah, that. So, how do we do that?

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.200
Well, you see...

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.500
Well, you see...

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.070
Yeah? Yeah?

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.700
Multiple Shadow Clones.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.570
Huh?

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.800
As it happens, it's all about Multiple Shadow Clones.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.330
What about them?

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.530
It's how we reduce the training period.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.500
Hmm...I don't get it at all.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.170
Okay, I'll explain now, so listen up.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.500
Right. Please keep it as simple as possible!

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:49.730
Okay, okay.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.370
Listen up...

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:58.000
Regular Clones the Shadow Clone Jutsu is a Ninjutsu

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.330
Shadow Clones Shadow Clones

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.530
Well, you can also call it a Ninjutsu for creating a copy of yourself.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.230
I know because I can also use the Shadow Clone Jutsu,

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.300
though not to your extent.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:16.000
There is a particular effect this Jutsu has on the caster.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.870
And since you're always using it, I'm sure you've picked up on this...

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.100
Anything experienced by the Shadow Clone

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.230
is also experienced by the caster

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.300
after the clone has returned to the caster's body.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.970
I told you to keep it simple.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.600
I knew you hadn't picked up on it.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.370
I mean, I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.930
Then let's both try creating Shadow Clones.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.170
Oh, one clone will be enough.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.000
Right.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.200
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.600
All right! Now let's split up into caster and Shadow Clone teams...

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.330
The Shadow Clone team will hide in the woods over there.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.800
Come with me, Shadow Clone Naruto.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.830
Right!

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.000
The originals can't see us, the Shadow Clone team,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.070
here in the woods.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.070
And now only we, will play rock-paper-scissors.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.030
What for?

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.670
Just do it.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:39.870
Hold it.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.900
It won't be any fun if we just play ordinary rock-paper-scissors.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.600
It's not supposed to be fun.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.370
Then the one who loses has to treat the other to Ichiraku Ramen.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.000
Okay, fine.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.200
Yes! Now I'm fired up!

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.800
One, two...

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.730
What're the Shadow Clones doing?

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.970
You'll find out soon.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.070
Yes!

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.400
I won! You have to treat me, Kakashi Sensei!

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.900
Okay, okay. Now we're going to break the Jutsu and vanish.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.430
Right.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.300
What were they doing?

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.530
You have to treat me to Ichiraku Ramen, Kakashi Sensei!

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.570
I beat you at rock-paper-scissors!

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.530
What're you doing arbitrarily making promises like that?

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.630
Now you get it, right?

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.900
Shadow Clone experiences

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.070
are accumulated within the original caster's body.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.630
I get it...

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.900
I never realized it at all because I was just sort of using

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.870
the Shadow Clones without really thinking about it.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.170
Normally, this Jutsu is used for scouting dangerous locations

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.630
and gathering information by infiltrating an enemy hideout, you see.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.100
But even having figured that out,

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.600
what does it have to do with reducing the training period?

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:09.400
Okay, okay. I'm going to explain that now... Yes!

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.800
Master Jiraiya sure did a good job of teaching the Rasengan Jutsu to this kid...

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:15.770
I'll say.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.130
Hurry! Hurry!

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.830
Basically, if you use a Shadow Clone

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:22.900
and conduct the same training with two people,

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.800
the experience will simply be doubled, right?

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.470
Right. Right.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.600
To put it a different way, it also means, if you use two people,

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.600
it'll take half the time it takes to train alone.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.800
And it'll take one-third the time if you use three.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.130
One-third with three.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.000
One-thousandth with a thousand.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:48.700
I see...

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.730
In other words, training that would take two days alone

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.170
will take one day with two people.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.470
Even training that would take twenty years alone

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.000
will take around a week with a thousand people.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.270
That's awesome! So we can do it that way!

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.300
He finally got it, huh...?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.570
You'll conduct the Change in Chakra Nature training,

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.730
you're going to learn now,

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.400
using the Multiple Shadow Clones at all times.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:15.670
Right!

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.200
Now I know why you're so strong, Kakashi Sensei!

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.430
So this is how you did your training, huh?

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:28.070
No, I've never even once trained using this approach.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.200
Huh?! Why not?

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.230
You can also make Shadow Clones, can't you?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.970
Indeed I can...

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.770
But I don't have as much Chakra as you do.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.630
And I can't sustain my Shadow Clones as long, either.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.470
And the only types of Jutsu suitable for me,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.430
since I don't have much Chakra,

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.230
are the ones requiring an even distribution of Chakra.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:54.770
Really? I have more Chakra than you, Kakashi Sensei?

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.270
You've got around four times more than me.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:02.230
Huh?! I've got that much?! I'm pretty awesome, aren't I?!

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.570
If you didn't suppress the power of the Nine-Tails Chakra,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.270
you'd have around a hundred times more.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.930
The Nine-Tails Chakra...

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.730
That's why this is a training approach only you can do.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.500
But since it requires a large amount of Chakra,

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.570
there's a possibility of rousing the Nine-Tails Chakra.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:27.800
And so I was summoned here in order to control the Nine-Tails Chakra.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:34.470
You're the one who hurt Sakura, Naruto.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.100
I'm ready!

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:46.670
All right! First you must train to strengthen your Chakra Property.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.070
Right!

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.570
Sandwich a leaf between your palms and cut it just with Chakra.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.900
Keep it there until you cut it right in half, okay?

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.630
All right! Let's do this!

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.870
And as I said before,

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.730
you'll do this training with Shadow Clones at all times.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:06.170
How many Clones should I make?

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.370
Well, if you take one person for one leaf...

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:12.970
Maybe around that many.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.500
Huh?!

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.330
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.600
Already got a little cut in, huh?

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.370
This might be quicker than I thought.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.530
We've received a bad report.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.770
It seems a village near the border of the Land of Fire

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.830
was attacked by someone.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.770
Was it the Akatsuki?

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.900
No. It seems the attacks were by the Village Hidden in the Rain...

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.670
What did you say? What're their intentions?

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.570
They might be intending to take advantage

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.670
of the fact that the Akatsuki are after Naruto.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.230
Either way, we must understand the situation first.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.370
Summon Asuma.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.800
But... What is it?

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.530
Naruto is in the village.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.300
If there are less Jonin in the village, his safety will come into question...

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.030
Next time: "Writhe"
