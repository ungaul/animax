WEBVTT

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.000
There's someone else where Sasuke is.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.710
Do you recognize the chakra?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.040
No!

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.550
But…

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.050
But what?

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.840
This chakra…

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.930
…has a real nasty feel to it!

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.140
Then we need to hurry even more.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.190
We don't know what this stranger might do to Sasuke.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.280
Is this the end for him?

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.740
Damn it…

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.500
Karin!

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.750
If you up the pace too much, you're going to collapse soon.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.340
Let's head to the others with youth power to the max!

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.960
Lee! Tenten!

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.980
The Blue Beast vs. Six Paths Madara Sasuke!

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.110
Who is that guy?!

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.150
Hey you!

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.490
I don't know who the hell you are, but what are you doing to Sasuke?

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.450
Oh, so that's what's going on…

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.210
Huh?

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.330
So it was you…

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.750
…Kabuto.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.210
I sensed a group rushing this way…

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.930
It was you, after all, Lord Orochimaru.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.640
That's Kabuto?!

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.970
His chakra is different!

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.140
Even his appearance.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.390
He has taken in the chakra of many people,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.980
even Sage Jutsu chakra.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.770
It's no wonder even you thought he was someone else, Karin…

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.980
I wonder if his chakra had a nasty feel to it

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.860
because he still has some of mine inside him?

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.410
– Or… – Get away from Sasuke, you brainy jerk!

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.250
What brings you here, Lord Orochimaru?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.210
I should ask you the same thing.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.210
What are you planning, Orochimaru?

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.300
Mister Kabuto…

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.840
Don't tell me you're going to absorb Sasuke?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.100
And would that make you Kabuke or Sasuto?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.900
You're the one who did this to Sasuke?!

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.770
You bastard!

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.030
Suigetsu… I don't desire to do that anymore.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.700
Nor am I going to steal Sasuke, Karin.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.160
Sasuke's chakra!

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.120
I can faintly sense it!

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.710
No way!

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.460
Kabuto… You're helping Sasuke?

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.710
Yes.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.090
With my Medical ninjutsu and much-tinkered cells of Hashirama,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.140
along with a certain someone's suggestion,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.390
I managed to stop him from dying.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.430
He's right.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.520
Huh?!

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.060
Well, well…

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.060
if it isn't the man I most respect…

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.440
the Second Hokage, Lord Tobirama Senju.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.610
However, Kabuto…

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.990
You being here means that

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.160
you were able to slip out of the infinite loop set up by Itachi's Izanami?

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.620
You're right.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.790
I was unable to acknowledge myself, I didn't even know who I was.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.550
That allowed you to give me easy answers and use me.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.260
Making me lose myself even more.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.200
If you're not satisfied with what you've had so far…

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.120
Just find other things and add them onto yourself…

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.080
one by one.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.750
It's still…

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.590
It's still not enough…

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.010
This is…still not me!

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.300
But with that jutsu, Itachi made me realize…

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.230
that I am none other…than Kabuto…

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.230
…and where my home is.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.400
Does it seem like the person inside has changed too?

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.860
That is the jutsu known as Izanami.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.160
The jutsu is set up so that you cannot undo it

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.200
until you reflect upon yourself and accept who you are.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.370
Sasuke...

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.500
Now I wish from the bottom of my heart

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.590
to not lose my home.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.180
And Itachi, who wanted to protect Sasuke even unto death…

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.930
His feelings have pierced through my heart strongly.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.180
Hey!

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.930
Isn't it a little too late to say things like that?

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.270
You teamed up with that fake Madara!

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.940
You guys started this war!

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.030
You're right.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.700
Both Obito and I…

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.080
…thought we'd lost our place in this world.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.240
And dragged everyone else into this.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.080
But, I now know who I am.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.630
And what I must do!

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.550
You may be reinforcements, but you're nothing more than pebbles.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.510
You won't make any difference at this point.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.060
That's Madara?!

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.180
Yes, that's him.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.640
Kakashi, are you all right?

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.020
Yes, thanks to Guy.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.150
I don't mean that.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.070
I'm talking about my Sage Art Rasengan hitting you earlier.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.860
That was okay too.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.160
I diverted it with my Kamui

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.530
just as it was making contact.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.990
Kamui!

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.120
I'm glad… Sage Art?

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.750
You mean, senjutsu?

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.170
Yes.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.300
Only senjutsu works against him…

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.090
As well as…

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.050
physical attacks such as taijutsu.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.220
Which means our only hope is the Fourth Hokage's senjutsu

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.230
and your taijutsu, Guy.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.320
If I recall, Sensei, senjutsu isn't your forte… Yes.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.610
In all honesty, I'm weak in senjutsu.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.110
It takes me too long to infuse the chakra

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.370
and I can't maintain it very long.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.160
I haven't used it very much in combat either.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.000
Furthermore, in this state, I can't weave signs,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.380
so I don't think I can even fight effectively.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.300
So, it's showtime for the wild blue beast, eh?

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.720
Eight Inner Gates!

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.060
Seventh Gate of Shock!

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.020
Open!

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.440
Blue vapor?

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.320
Guy!

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.450
Eight Inner Gates…

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.410
One gate before the Gate of Death…

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.330
He insults me, not bringing out the Red Vapor.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.590
Don't let the black spheres or rod touch you!

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.680
Who could've imagined Guy mastering the Eight Gates!

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.060
Those are not human movements!

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.980
Take this!

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.640
Hirudora! Afternoon Tiger!

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.710
I have to use the Flying Raijin once more

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.550
to throw myself into the Black Sphere's path!

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.130
Kakashi, take the kunai!

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:14.510
Right!

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.020
Rock Lee!

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.070
Guy Sensei! Are you all right?

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.110
Yes. Thanks, Lee.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.950
How is Tenten?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.620
She wanted to check something out, and made me go on ahead.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.080
Just when I was about to catch up...

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.500
all of a sudden the Hirudora appeared.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.590
Are you all right, Guy?

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:52.670
Yeah.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.380
Only my right arm and a few ribs are hurt.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.010
What are we going to do if our last ray of hope, your taijutsu…

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.640
is no good?

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.980
He's…too strong.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.270
Wait, Kakashi…

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.440
It's too soon to decide my taijutsu won't work!

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.190
But…

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.360
Our youth hasn't faded yet!

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.740
Do not lose hope!

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.000
Guy Sensei…

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.000
It's true that everything we wish for will not come to be...

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.460
But things that we must do

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.090
must always begin with a wish.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.050
Just like the times I challenged you.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.140
I challenge you, Kakashi!

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.230
And this is not a bluff.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.270
Don't tell me...

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.190
you're going to—!

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.440
The end has come for the Leaf's Blue Beast…

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.650
It's time for the Red Beast to emerge!

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.990
No way… Not the final Gate of Death!

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.950
Guy! Don't do that!

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.330
Think it over hard!

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.080
No one here wishes for that!

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.000
Not even you father would... No!

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.040
But I wish it.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.210
Guy Sensei!

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.630
Do you really think it's that time?

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.340
Lee, don't look at me like that.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.010
This time, you sit back and enjoy the show!

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.390
You remind me of myself back then,

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.770
when I was a complete failure.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.060
Now, in matches against that elite genius Kakashi,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.980
we're nearly even.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.610
"Even if I cannot do ninjutsu or genjutsu…

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.320
I want to prove that can still become a splendid ninja?"

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.910
Isn't that your Ninja Way?

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.290
That's a fine goal.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.160
It's a goal worth fighting for.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.050
So you must believe in your path and run hard toward it!

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.630
Become strong so I can just sit back and enjoy the show!

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.180
Father…

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:20.770
Yes, I'm in!
Congratulations!

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.520
Not there… not there… not there!

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.070
ACADEMY ACCEPTANCE RESULTS

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.900
Not there… not there… not there…

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:35.990
There, I see it!

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.990
We did it!

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.660
Congratulations!

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.170
Yes! I got in!

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.040
My son, search to your heart's content!

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.090
It's not there…

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.800
My name is nowhere on the list, Papa!

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.050
Then keep on looking, Guy!

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.470
You have worked hard and done everything you possibly could.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.270
There is no way all that effort will not be rewarded.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.600
Those tears are blurring your vision. You will see your name soon.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.020
Yes!

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.860
Might Guy… Might Guy… Might Guy...

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.990
He just won't give up, will he?

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.490
It's very unsightly.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.160
KAKASHI HATAKE

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.380
Papa, I'm sorry…

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.840
I'm so sorry…

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.470
Do not give up, Guy!

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:38.890
Don't turn away!

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.720
You will find it! You will!

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.980
ACADEMY ORIENTATION

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.910
IF I RUN 500 LAPS, I'LL BE ACCEPTED AS AN ALTERNATE

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.660
Isn't that the kid who was making such a fuss about failing the test?

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.420
This is for my papa who never gave up on me too…

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.420
I'll definitely get in!

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.220
What does he mean by "self rule"?

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.640
He can't just decide something like that!

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.850
I know about it…

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.850
He cannot perform ninjutsu or genjutsu at all.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.850
The only thing he has going for him is to move his body around.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.020
That may be so, but he looks ready to drop.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.450
Guy, don't give up.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.030
But you've got it all wrong!

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.080
T-Two hundred thirty-five...laps…

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.170
He's not even half way done!

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:06.560
Papa...

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.650
Guy! You fool!

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.030
I'm sorry, Papa…

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.950
I'm already five years old, but I can't even run 500 laps…

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.950
Do not apologize!

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.950
I'm not scolding you because of that!

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.790
Never apologize for trying hard!

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.460
It's an insult to your determination, Guy!

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.920
Then why?

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.170
You're applying your self-rule in the wrong manner!

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.840
Doing 500 laps will qualify you for the vacant place in the academy?

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.970
That's not a self-rule!

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.850
That's just a wish!

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.640
The kind you go on a pilgrimage for!

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.400
You see,

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.440
you impose a self-rule on yourself to spur you on

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.780
and help you overcome a challenge or difficult situation.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.110
You apply a self-rule on yourself only.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.910
Because of that rule,

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.910
you are able to gather your strength and focus on your efforts…

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.290
So even if you fail,

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.130
applying that rule keeps you extremely disciplined and focused.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.590
That is the way a self-rule works.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.340
I'm sorry, Papa…

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.720
However, no one can find fault in your determination.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.140
Even if you can only make it half way,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.350
effort is effort.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.060
And for that, you deserve a big hug!

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.140
Papa!

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.730
Guy!

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.110
Oh…there they go again, that father and son.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.030
Isn't that abuse?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.030
Anyway, what's with those bodysuits?

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.280
Gross!

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.280
Thank you for your support!

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.950
Papa, I don't think that was support...

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.870
Then, encouragement.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.040
I guess…I can't do ninjutsu or genjutsu…

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.920
so that's why I failed the test… Listen, Guy!

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.630
Your youth has just begun!

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.420
Do not turn your back on your youth!

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.970
Just like me!

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.840
As your father,

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:10.310
I'm happy that ninjutsu and genjutsu aren't your strong points!

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.850
Knowing your shortcomings will highlight your strengths!

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.570
Your taijutsu is already shining brilliantly!

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.190
I'm very happy!

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.490
I've discovered my own child's strengths when he's still so young!

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.870
Papa, you're just saying that, aren't you?

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.580
Shortcomings can become strengths!

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.540
Being repetitious is just being polite!

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.710
To be loud is simply to be lively!

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.330
Obstinacy is merely earnestness!

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.920
Those who are selfish are like cats!

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.130
What about hairy people?

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.050
Mmm... Th-They're like cats too!

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.550
What about people with long torsos…?

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.560
Th-They're like cats!

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.560
Hey, Might Dai…

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.690
Are you playing "training" with your son again?

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.100
You sure work hard for a perennial genin!

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.900
Yeah! Thanks for your support!

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.750
Damn it! Still trying to act young at his age.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:15.370
Right?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.710
Oww!

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.040
What?!

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.630
Aren't you Dai's kid?!

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.880
What's the big idea?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.880
Don't you ever say anything stupid about my papa ever again!

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.970
Stupid is as stupid does. I just spoke the truth.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.180
If you say one bad word about Papa, I'll punch you five times!

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.560
That's my self-rule!

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.890
Your self-rule? Interesting.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.730
So I'll say it.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.400
Your dad is a good-for-nothing who can't do ninjutsu or genjutsu,

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.490
and can't even do taijutsu that well.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.150
You know what they say?

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.120
He's more a comedian than a genin.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.450
Yeah, a comedian who only tells jokes about youth isn't funny!

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.040
You said two bad things!

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.920
That's ten punches!

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.670
And we'll punch you 20 times!

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.930
Damn it!

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.990
I can't believe you couldn't return a single punch

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.910
after what they said about your father.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.580
Why did you do such a thing?

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.870
Papa, how can you stay so positive and optimistic?

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.500
When does one's youth come to an end?

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.090
As long as you never turn your back against youth...

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.380
it never ends.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.050
Then are you saying your youth won't come to an end when you die, Papa?

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.380
What are you saying, Guy?

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.720
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Papa's Youth"

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.890
That is when youth climaxes!

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.060
When it burns the brightest!

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:09.230
PAPA'S YOUTH Tune in again!
