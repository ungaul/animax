WEBVTT

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.830
The Legacy 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.100
Granny Chiyo...

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.130
What are you trying to do?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.770
Medical Ninjutsu...?

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.400
No...

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.270
We did what we had to do.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.900
Now, if we don't hurry back to the Village Hidden in the Sand

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.130
and give you an antidote...

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.170
More important than that,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.870
there is...something...

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.370
that I still...must do.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.530
This is what Granny Chiyo was talking about...

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.700
Is that...?

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.530
Yeah...

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.330
Hey, what are you doing?!

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.530
Granny Chiyo... in exchange for her own life...

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.330
Sakura...

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.500
She's going to bring Gaara back to life!

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.530
Bring him back to life...

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.400
Is such a thing... really possible?

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.930
This Jutsu...

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.070
is a special Jutsu that only Granny Chiyo possesses...

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.130
Really?!

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.300
There's no way that such an extraordinary Jutsu could exist...

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.400
That Chakra flow...

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.800
No doubt...

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.370
It is accompanied by a considerable risk...

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.830
Damn...!

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.830
I don't have enough Chakra...

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.700
Damn...

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.500
You can use my Chakra!

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.800
Would that be possible?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.170
Granny...

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.900
Gaara is a Jinchuriki, just like he is.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.830
More than anyone in the Hidden Sand Village,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.100
Naruto knows how Gaara feels.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.900
After all, the Jinchuriki has been treated the same way in every village...

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.170
That's exactly why he feels like he has to save Gaara.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.600
It doesn't make any difference to him

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.870
if he's from the Leaf or the Sand.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.970
Place your hand on top of mine.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.030
Naruto...

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.700
Naruto's dream is to become the Hokage...

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.400
He was frustrated when he heard that Gaara had become the Kazekage.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.000
But at the same time,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.600
he was also very happy for Gaara from the bottom of his heart.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.830
Naruto has a mysterious power...

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.330
However small the words he exchanges, he makes friends immediately...

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.830
with everyone he meets...

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:16.000
Amidst this Shinobi world created by us foolish old people...

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.300
I am glad that a person like you showed up...

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.500
The things I did in the past were nothing but mistakes...

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.530
But...in my last hour,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.470
it seems I shall finally be able to do the right thing.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.370
The Village Hidden in the Sand and ... the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:58.300
The future is likely to be different from the way things were in our time...

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.400
Your mysterious power that Kakashi spoke of...

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.700
That power is likely to alter the future greatly...

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.130
when you become a Hokage like none before...

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.830
And you, Sakura...!

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.730
Yes...

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.670
Next time, help the person you cherish most...

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.670
not an old lady with one foot in the grave...

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.330
You are very much like me...

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:41.530
There are not many women who have a man's courage...

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.370
You will probably become a Kunoichi who surpasses her master...

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.870
Naruto, this old lady has a favor to ask you...

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.630
You are the one and only person

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.630
who is capable of knowing the extent of Gaara's pain...

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.400
And Gaara knows your pain, too...

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.830
Please...help Gaara...

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.500
Gaara!

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.430
Gaara...!

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.770
Who are you...calling...?

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.500
Whose is it...? This hand...

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.970
Oh... It's just my hand again...

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.130
My hand...

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.500
Me...?

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.800
Who am I...?

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.330
I...

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.900
I am...

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.470
Gaara...

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.030
Naruto...

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.470
This is...

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.630
Everyone came running to help you.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:15.970
Lord Gaara!

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.930
Are you all right?!

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.970
- Yes! - Hurrah!

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.800
Thank heavens... That's great!

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.570
Putting us to all this trouble!

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.070
Good grief.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.900
You're such a bothersome little brother, making us worry like that.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.830
What's with you guys... acting arrogant like that?!

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.370
Gaara is the Kazekage, you know.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.970
Don't be so disrespectful!

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.370
You're nothing but subordinates!

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.100
Gaara... How do you feel?

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.930
You shouldn't try to get up so quickly.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.500
Your body hasn't completely healed.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.800
Thank heavens...!

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.670
I thought Lord Kazekage... might really die...

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.030
There's no way that Lord Gaara would kick the bucket that easily!

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.170
Gaara is reserved, cool, strong, handsome, an elite, and...

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.430
Yes, yes, but he's still kind of cute somehow...

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.430
And yet, he is the Kazekage...

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.630
This time, I'll show them for sure... that I can protect Lord Gaara in a crisis!

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.570
No, I will!

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.730
I will!

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.000
Lord Gaara!

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.070
Out of the way, underling!

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.030
Come to think of it, I am still a Genin.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.030
Don't feel so depressed.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:08.800
It's a well known fact that women have a weakness for the cool, elite type.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.900
I think Shikamaru was saying something like that too...

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.930
He has known the same suffering I have...

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.700
And he has taught me that

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.570
it is possible to change one's path in life...

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.730
I, too, want to become the kind of man that everyone looks up to...

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.130
Thank you... Naruto!

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.530
If you're going to say that,

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.700
you should say it to the old lady, not me...

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.270
She saved Gaara with an incredible Medical Ninjutsu...

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.970
She got tired out, so she's sleeping now, but...

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.600
When the old lady gets back to the village, she'll get well again...

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.900
No, you're wrong...

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.500
Granny Chiyo used  that Jutsu...

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.800
What do you mean I'm wrong?

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.200
I...

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.230
She wasn't just using Medical Ninjutsu...

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.970
She used the Reanimation Ninjutsu.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.870
Granny Chiyo is dead.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.130
Reanimation Ninjutsu?

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.270
Wh- What do you mean by that?

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.400
It's a Ninjutsu that allows you

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.330
to bring a dead person back to life in exchange for your own...

00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.970
It can't be...!

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.400
As I thought...

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.330
Guy Sensei...

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.970
At one time, in the Sand Puppet Unit,

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:19.000
they were doing research to develop a Jutsu that could bring puppets to life.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.770
Granny Chiyo headed up the project...

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.500
They succeeded in developing the Jutsu in theory,

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.400
but midway, they decided that the risks were too great.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.070
Before it reached the stage of human experiments,

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.430
it was designated as a Forbidden Jutsu and it was sealed.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.700
Amidst this Shinobi world created by us foolish old people...

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.970
I am glad that a person like you showed up...

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:58.630
The things I did in the past were nothing but mistakes...

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.170
But in my last hour,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.870
it seems I shall finally be able to do the right thing...

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.870
The Village Hidden in the Sand and the Village Hidden in the Leaves...

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.430
The future to come is likely to be different

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.130
from the way things were in our time...

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.000
Your mysterious power that Kakashi spoke of...

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:26.600
That power is likely to alter the future greatly...

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:35.470
when you become a Hokage like none before...

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:56.000
I was only pretending to be dead.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:03.870
Just like that.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.470
She looks as if she could start laughing at any minute.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.130
Her face looks so...peaceful...

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:14.200
Yes...

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.800
Yes...

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.770
Naruto, you are a mysterious one, after all.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.030
You have the power to change people.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.570
Granny Chiyo always used to say she didn't care about the village's future...

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.770
She was not the kind of person to do such a thing for Gaara.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.330
Granny Chiyo entrusted the future to Gaara and you...

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.430
Hers was a magnificent end, befitting of a Shinobi.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:23.330
Yeah...just like Gramps, the Third.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:26.330
You're right...

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.370
Yeah.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.830
Now, I can clearly understand the Old Lady's wish.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.100
Lord Gaara...!

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:38.900
It's okay...

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.500
Everyone, let us pray for Granny Chiyo...

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.130
Granny Chiyo...

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.230
The Sand Herald reports one death in the line of duty:

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.330
Granny Chiyo of the Village Hidden in the Sand.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.430
Lord Kazekage has safely returned to active duty.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.530
Guy's unit and Kakashi's unit both completed their missions without incident.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.670
They are scheduled to return to the Leaf Village in three days' time.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.670
Is that so? All seems to have gone smoothly somehow.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.000
But I wonder if things are fine the way they are...

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.030
What do you mean?

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.070
Lady Tsunade, if I may be allowed to speak.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.330
Next time: "Return of the Kazekage"
