WEBVTT

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.670
I sure was young... back then...

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.230
Good work... on the Feudal Lord escort.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.970
What's your beef?!

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.830
I protected the king, the Feudal Lord just as you told me to do!

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.430
Why don't you even attempt to acknowledge me?!

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.100
King...huh...?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.770
How about acknowledging me at least a little bit, Dad?!

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.570
You don't understand...

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.030
how difficult and important a battle to protect the king is.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.370
I understand that people died.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.800
But sacrifice comes with a Shinobi mission.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.830
You can't possibly understand now...

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.870
the true significance of protecting the king.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.700
You just don't want to acknowledge me!

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.730
Now I get the feeling...

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.370
I kind of understand what you were talking about.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.770
I'm sorry I left the Hidden Leaf... and just did whatever I wanted.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.100
I have no regrets, though.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.670
Now I feel like it wasn't so bad being born into the Sarutobi Clan.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.030
You properly fulfilled your duty as leader of the village...

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.000
You were a cool dad...

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.100
The Quietly Approaching Threat

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.730
Heave ho, heave ho... heave ho...

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.230
Carrying lumber is a mission, too!

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.700
Let's do our best to carry it. Heave ho...

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.800
Whoa!

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.770
Wh-What's the matter?

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.830
L-Let's take a little break.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.870
We're not used to this kind of work.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.530
You guys are a sorry bunch.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.670
The village has been saved and the Fifth Hokage was unharmed.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.630
But that was because of the great efforts by Brother Naruto and the others...

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.200
We have to do our best with whatever we can do,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.300
so we'll also be able to support the village!

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.870
Well said.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.200
You guys are the ones who will support the Hidden Leaf in the next generation.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.270
And it seems Naruto played a huge role in the earlier incident.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.270
Iruka Sensei.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.400
I'm happy to have such amazing students.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.930
Konohamaru. I'm okay now.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.730
If we all work together, we'll be okay no matter what happens.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.230
Next!

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.130
Next!

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.530
- Next! - Yes!

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.370
Next! Next! Next!

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:55.500
Next!

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.130
You're too slow! Next! Next, next!

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.730
Next!

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.100
What's the matter?! Where are the next documents?!

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.730
Oh, uh...that's it... You're finished!

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.200
I see.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.770
Th-This is a first, isn't it?

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.500
You don't usually take your work this seriously, Lady Tsunade.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.730
You could say that.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.100
It seems there was quite the commotion over just a couple of thieves...

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.670
That's pathetic, Princess Tsunade.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.800
Just from this...

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.470
the Hidden Leaf Village will turn into a laughingstock

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.400
amongst the surrounding lands and the Feudal Lord.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.000
It seems your orders are slow in coming

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.270
and then become forestalled!

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.070
Your slow decision-making endangers the village.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.570
It's all your responsibility as the Hokage. Bear this firmly in mind!

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.000
Those old geezers and their big mouths...

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.770
Who knows what they'll say if unfinished work continues to stack up...

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.470
Damn it!

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.670
Oh, that's right.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.900
The report from the one

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.400
who was sent to contact Lord Jiraiya has arrived.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.270
I see. So he's back...

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.930
You got hospitalized again because you tried to act cool and snuck out

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.970
even though your injury hasn't healed yet.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.770
It says in this book that the bonds of friendship grow deeper

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.470
if you rush to a friend who's in a jam...

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.930
That's a comic book, right? You're so random these days.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.630
Here...

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.070
What?

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.470
It seems women who like you will feed you.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.800
Well, it's not like I'm testing you or anything...

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.900
Look you... Sakura.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.670
S-Sakura... I-I can't eat anymore...

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.130
Oh, but if you insist I eat, then...

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.630
Eat until you die!

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.130
Yo! Hm?

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:31.900
I-I can't breathe...

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.370
Sakura fed Naruto an apple...

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.000
Which means...

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.200
Oh, for crying out loud!

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.200
Why can't I have someone normal on my team?!

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.270
Huh?

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.230
Huh?

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.330
What happened?

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.830
Attacks by what is suspected to be the same two-man Shinobi team

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.430
in seven locations in five neighboring lands have been verified.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.430
Although they have not yet succeeded in invading the Land of Fire,

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.200
judging from their line of action, it's only a matter of time...

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.030
Lady Tsunade?

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.570
So the Akatsuki Organization has gone into action.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.330
Let's do this.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:34.700
Hold it.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:40.030
Before doing that... I must pray to my god.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.570
You're always such a pain in the neck.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.930
It's a pain in the neck for me, too.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.100
But the commandments are strict, so I have no choice, do I?!

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.530
You probably think you've got me cornered...

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.130
But you don't.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.930
I lured you guys here, you see!

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.670
Now that I know you are with the Akatsuki,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.830
I cannot let you escape.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.200
Oh, man... We're trapped, Kakuzu...

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.800
No problem. Actually, this is favorable for us.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.200
In the name of Yugito Ni 'i of the Hidden Clouds...

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.770
I'll kill you!

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.100
Huh...? What?

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.100
What's up with that, "I'll kill you," stuff?

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.230
When people show me all that enthusiasm and stuff...

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.030
I start to get irritated.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.730
And when I'm irritated, I become enraged.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.330
And when I become enraged... Shut up, Hidan.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.630
Okay. okay...

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.300
But you know, when I become enraged,

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.630
I start feeling like,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.130
"I don't care about our objective. I just want to smash everything."

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.330
Knock it off, Hidan. The objective is absolute.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.900
This mission doesn't go along with my religion in the first place.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.370
The motto of the Jashin religion is mass slaughter.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.700
Leaving people alive goes against the commandments.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.630
From the outset,

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.570
I'm not inclined to take part in a mission

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.600
that breaks the commandments.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.900
I may not look it, but I'm quite devout!

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.630
So not being able to kill is a pain in the neck.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.630
So how about we settle this by talking things over?

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.500
Talking things over, you say?

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.330
What's up with this guy?

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.730
Why don't you just come quietly?

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.270
Stop messing around!

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.530
Huh...? Looks like that's a no.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.100
Are you an idiot?

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.400
Come on. Are you kidding me?

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.430
What's up with this Jinchuriki?

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.270
She's totally morphed into a Tailed Beast.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:47.330
Oh man...

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.370
Uh-oh!

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.630
Hot!

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.070
Don't cats have sensitive tongues for hot stuff?

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.030
So this is the Two-Tails monster cat known as the wraith...

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.030
And I'm a rat in a cage, no less.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.230
This is not amusing...

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:27.570
Oh-ho.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.870
So you made a great showing while I was gone, huh?

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.270
Where the heck were you, Kakashi Sensei?

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.330
Oh...nowhere special.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.900
Asuma Sensei.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.770
I knew you'd be here.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.570
Kakashi, got a minute?

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.370
I want to talk to you...

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.600
Naruto, Sai... Here, a get well gift!

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.500
Yikes!

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.570
I've had enough apples...

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.830
I hear you checked out what was happening outside...

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.570
You could say that...

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.730
What a nice day.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.000
Hm? Yeah...it is.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.570
Naruto and Sakura are coming along very well.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.600
And so are Shikamaru, Choji and Ino...

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.130
The next generation is growing up quickly.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.930
They'll overtake us just like that...

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.930
Come on. I still won't be giving in to them.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.430
But this is something the Hidden Leaf should be very pleased about.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.870
So...

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.530
What did you want to talk about?

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.700
Hm? Oh, as it happens...

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.630
There you are... I finally found you.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.130
Kurenai... Did you need something?

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.530
I heard Asuma was here, you see...

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:09.970
No kidding...?

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.300
So, Asuma... What did you want to talk about?

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.870
Uh, I'll tell you later... Sorry.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.370
Now I really want to know...

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.770
What're you doing, Naruto?

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.400
I don't have the time to be lying around here.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.400
I need to get back to my training...

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.500
That being said, you're still...

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.430
I'm still too weak.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.370
That's why...

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.670
That's exactly why...

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.530
I have to get stronger to get power that won't hurt everyone...

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.930
Power that will protect everyone.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.670
That's why I have to get stronger.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.230
Naruto...

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.100
Well, hold your horses...

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.770
Right now, your training is to heal those wounds.

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.500
Kakashi Sensei!

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.300
And let me make this clear to you, in particular, Naruto...

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:23.130
Huh?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.400
If you leave the hospital, what awaits is training so severe

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.600
you'll wish you'd stayed in the hospital longer.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.030
So be prepared for that!

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.770
R-Right...!

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.870
I-I understand...

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.170
Okay... Now he won't push things too far.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:41.700
Sakura...

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.200
Y-Yes...?!

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:47.330
I've got something to take care of. So I leave the rest to you.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.230
What...?

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.000
Make sure you don't let him overdo things...

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:51.800
Bye!

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.400
Oh man, isn't he slick!

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.370
I read the report.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.900
Does it look like Naruto will be able to learn a new Jutsu?

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:14.700
How about it?

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.200
I don't know.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.430
No way.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.030
I'm not sure...

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.400
But he can probably do it...

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.000
That new training approach is yielding results, after all.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.370
And more importantly...

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.630
He has a clear objective.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:36.470
Sasuke...huh?

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.830
It's already been thirty minutes. Aren't you done yet, Hidan?

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.700
Shut up! Don't interfere with the ritual!

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.570
Ouch...

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.700
Can't you skip some of that

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.800
perverse praying you do each and every time?

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.000
Let's get right to the next one.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.330
This is a pain in the neck for me too.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.570
But I have no choice but to follow the commandments.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.570
And what do you mean by skip?!

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.000
That's blasphemy against God!

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.470
One more to go for our mission.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.670
One by one...

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.470
Next is the Land of Fire.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.900
For crying out loud.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.100
That Naruto is already starting his training, even though he's still on the mend.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.300
Knowing who he is, there's no doubt he'll get reckless.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.400
Getting stronger through sheer determination

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.070
just isn't done anymore.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.670
And excessive training could also have a reverse effect.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.770
Not only that, he also has the physical idiosyncrasy

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.870
that allows him to work much harder than other people.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.270
The least I can do is help him in whatever way I can.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.770
Next time: "Akatsuki's Invasion"
