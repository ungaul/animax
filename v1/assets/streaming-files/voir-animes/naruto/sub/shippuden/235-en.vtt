WEBVTT

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.350
Naruto… Can you share your chakra with everyone again?

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.770
I can't right now!

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.230
Kurama hasn't finished amassing chakra yet!

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.600
In order to take down the main body,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.890
we need to mow down the big ones and slip past them.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.980
The distance is too great to make a single leap for it.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.350
We also need time to weave signs and repel the enemy's attacks.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.140
Without your chakra, Naruto,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.140
it's very likely we'll suffer heavy casualties.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.310
And the Medical Corps can't come up to the front.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.100
Mow down and slip past?

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.350
Easy.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.230
This guy has the power to clear the distance in a single leap

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.230
and repel enemy attacks.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.680
I can now stay nearby and

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.680
heal anyone who suffers serious injuries at all times.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.520
- Summoning Jutsu! - Summoning Jutsu! - Summoning Jutsu!

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.270
The New Three-Way Deadlock

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.180
Huh?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.520
Wait…

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.310
This color…

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.310
You're…

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.640
Gamakichi!

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.390
Pop was tied up with some negotiations,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.100
so I came in his place.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.390
You surprised?!

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.180
No! No!

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.640
But man, you sure got big all of a sudden!

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.680
I'm more shocked than I was about Akamaru!

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.930
You humans grow too slow, that's all.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.270
Anyway, what's up?

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.270
Right!

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.680
See the gigantic guy way in the back?

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.930
Could you get me closer to it with a big leap?

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.230
You mean the biggest one over there?

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.230
Yeah.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.730
Lord Sasuke, your desire?

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.810
I need you to just keep advancing forward.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.520
I'll get the real body in the back!

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.600
Sakura dear!

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.980
You've finally able to invoke the 100 Healings Mark!

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.430
Lady Tsunade would be so proud…

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.310
Lady Katsuyu, we don't have time…

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.730
Please divide and attend to each person in the Allied Shinobi Forces.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.640
Our role will be to heal everyone.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.180
I never expected

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.310
to see the Three-Way Deadlock Summoning again!

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.180
It is a new era!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.890
Go!

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.430
Go! Aoda!

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.680
Lady Katsuyu, please proceed!

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.140
Jump, Gamakichi!

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.480
This is the original Team 7…

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.100
Nice, Gamakichi!

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.310
Your size isn't just for show, eh!

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.390
Nevermind that, just hurry up and weave your jutsu signs!

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.270
Get with it, or I'll shake you off my head.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.520
Even his attitude has gotten bigger!

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.600
I know!

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.230
What's going on?

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.810
It's all right.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.060
These slugs are part of the Fifth Hokage's Healing Jutsu.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.100
Please do not worry.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.180
My strength is being restored!

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.270
My wounds are…

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.930
It's healing me…

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.390
Her 100 Healings Mark was only just activated!

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.140
And yet she can already perform Lady Katsuyu's long-distance healing!

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.140
Sakura… You are simply amazing!

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.810
Lord Sasuke?

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.020
Keep moving forward.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.100
Sasuke!

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.850
Go for it!

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.930
Do it!

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.140
Hang in there!

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.520
Aim well!

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.930
You can do it!

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.350
Give it to 'em!

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:21.640
Yes!

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.350
Wind Style: Massive Rasen Shuriken!

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.180
Inferno Style: Susano'o Flame Control!

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.640
Sasuke and I must've been compatible, after all…

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.520
Yes… Only "Wind" can beat "Lightning."

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.430
No…

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.730
That's not what I meant.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.730
Only "Wind" can assist and magnify "Fire"…

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.390
It's hit!

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.230
It really hit!

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.980
I don't recall ever seeing a Flame Control of that magnitude.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.930
And they combined jutsu with matching chakra ratios!

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.100
That's difficult even for a seasoned duo!

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.230
A windmill-like shuriken, and an arrow blacker than lacquer…

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.140
Let's name it

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.310
the Scorch Style Nimbus Gale Jet Black Arrow Formation Zero!

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.640
Nah, never mind.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.560
Burn away…

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.520
You heard what Sasuke said earlier, didn't you?

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.430
What are his true intentions?

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.100
I have no idea.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.410
Damn it!

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.700
Why did we branch off from Sasuke?

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.330
This wasn't the deal!

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.740
I'm safe!

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.830
No thanks to being on the frontlines!

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.830
There they are.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.830
Look at the sorry state you're in, Tsunade.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.870
Gross… A gigantic slug…

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.740
How much salt would you need to take it down?

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.830
That's just one part of Katsuyu

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.530
that was summoned from Shikkotsu Woods.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.700
I'd say it's pretty small, actually.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.870
You don't say.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.030
I thought we were here for the Five Kage, not the slugs.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.080
Lord Orochimaru, stop paying attention to Suigetsu

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.910
and get to the task at hand.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.700
Are you that upset because you couldn't stay with Sasuke?

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.700
That's totally…not the case!

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.030
Let's just do this.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.910
Damn you, Suigetsu!

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.990
Why are you picking on me?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.780
Doesn't everyone who sees a slug want to sprinkle salt on it?

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.660
Tsunade first!

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.200
Let's go.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.740
Lady Tsunade!

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.780
Wait, was the Hokage always a granny?

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.950
Ugh…

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:20.370
It's not like she had a really long torso either, right?

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.780
It seems you were reckless, Tsunade.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.410
Orochimaru?

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.280
Katsuyu… I came here to aid the Five Kage.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.330
I'm not an enemy.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.830
I have no reason to believe you.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.620
Besides, you were dead!

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.660
If I do anything that strikes you as suspect,

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.580
you're welcome to kill me once and for all with your acid.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.240
All right.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.870
I'll believe you.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.080
You're quite sensible, unlike Manda.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.410
Now then…

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.910
First of all… Where are the other Kage?

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.870
They're recovering inside my fragments.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.160
They sustained serious injuries, and it's very…

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.910
But Katsuyu…

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.870
With you here, why is it taking so long for them to heal?

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.740
I can only use my power in response

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.870
to the strength of Lady Tsunade's 100 Healings.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.410
But Lady Tsunade is extremely weak right now,

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.740
so I'm not able to activate my strength fully.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.120
Is that how the system worked?

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.740
Anyway, whatever I remember, I've never seen Tsunade so weak.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.330
So it must be true.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.370
I am trying to persevere and focus on healing,

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.120
despite the Summoning starting to unravel.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:05.870
That's why I haven't been able to properly reattach her body.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.370
Suigetsu, bring Tsunade's lower half and join it to her upper half.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:12.410
Huh?!

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.490
I'm better at cutting things up.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.330
Ugh…

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.620
The slugs are all slimy and wriggly. Gross!

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.370
Well, so are you, Suigetsu!

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.700
In fact, you're grosser and weirder because you have a human form!

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.620
Karin… Let her bite you so that she can heal.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.450
What? I don't want anyone but Sasuke biting me…

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.080
Hah! You just admitted you're in love with Sasuke!

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.950
Huh?

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.080
You're wrong!

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.030
How could I hate, I mean, like that damn Sasuke?

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.950
What are you saying?

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.780
He tried to kill me… And it was irresistible…

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.280
No, it wasn't!

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.780
You were covered in bite marks long before Sasuke bit you!

00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:59.740
Shut up!

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.620
Right now, I'm exclusively for Sasuke.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.620
Don't be so defiant, you denture mold model.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.240
Besides, how does your body work anyway?

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.870
You're the weird one.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.700
What? Say that again!

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:11.870
You two…

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.280
Make it snappy.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.660
You're both weird.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.660
So stop fighting.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.330
Or else…

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.370
I'll have my snakes ties you up

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.490
and crawl into your mouth and possess you.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.280
You're the weirdest one among us all!

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.740
He's weird and he's abnormal.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.120
WEIRD                           ABNORMAL

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.780
She's taking so much, I might end up aging into a hag.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.830
Lady Tsunade, you're going to be all right!

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.200
Tsunade, be a little grateful to me.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.410
You betrayed the village… So why all of this now?

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.450
The range of things that interest me has expanded.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:40.280
In the past, I wanted to become the wind and turn the windmill myself.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.740
But now, I know the pleasure

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.620
of waiting around for someone else's wind.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.240
One that is unpredictable.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.830
And I don't want that wind to get sealed away before I can enjoy it.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.950
You still don't make any sense.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.160
But…I suppose you've changed a little.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.330
I never imagined you would save me…

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.280
Even that is possible.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.120
Do you remember?

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.120
The Three-Way Deadlock from that time?

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.870
The summoning… No…

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.030
Just like how it's written… The Three-Way Deadlock…

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.780
Earth Style Stone Pistol Jutsu!

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.200
It's useless, Tsunade.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.780
The Earth Style of the Hidden Stone will most likely

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.700
cause this mountain to collapse.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.580
If we're going to escape, we can't wait.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.160
Just the two of us.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.410
Jiraiya…too!

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.160
We can't take Jiraiya and outrun them.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.370
That's why I'll use Medical Ninjutsu to…

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.870
Tsunade, this is war.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.240
We can't let our emotions get in the way

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.410
and lower the probability of success.

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.660
And what is success?

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.200
To survive.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.280
One alone can't. Two probably can.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.160
Three spells…

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.830
certain death.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.240
Go on ahead.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.780
I'll take care of Jiraiya…

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:49.530
Make one move…and I'll kill you.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.450
Seems like we're in a three-way deadlock.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.240
What are you talking about?

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.030
It just boils down to who will act first.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:11.910
Jiraiya is already…

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.370
Jiraiya trusts you completely.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.950
So much so, that it might freeze you in your tracks.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.910
So foolish!

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.280
I'll…!

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.450
Hey! Jiraiya, Tsunade, Orochimaru!

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.370
I've brought reinforcements!

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.870
People can change.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.160
Or they die before they do. It's one or the other.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.490
Although he died without changing…

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.410
He probably trusted you until the very end.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.410
Orochimaru…

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.700
If you were like this sooner, Jiraiya might not have had to die…

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.370
And if I had…

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.240
Jiraiya might have changed too.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.700
Like how it was for us, the Legendary Sannin,

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.200
things don't always go the way you want them to.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:58.990
We're not made of stone. Distortions will appear somewhere.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.660
Perhaps that's why I want to observe Sasuke's future.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.330
While patiently waiting for his wind to blow.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.700
Fine. I thank you for helping me heal.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.330
So… Do you know about the war?

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:25.200
Of course. That's why I'm helping you out like this.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.490
How long have I been like this?

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.200
I can report on the battle situation.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.950
How did you end up on the front?

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.910
I see… Sakura summoned Katsuyu!

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.700
Around now, a new Three-Way Deadlock

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.160
is probably making their debut.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.120
What?

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.080
Well, we're heading back.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.830
You should work on healing the other Kage.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.460
There is doubt in your heart.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.410
Won't you stop this?

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.120
It's because of that, I want to repudiate everything.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.040
I can't see you not understanding Naruto's feelings.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.500
There is nothing in my heart!

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.460
Do you really think that such things can fill the hole in your heart?

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.790
Just like it was with me! Isn't that right Kakashi?

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.660
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Kakashi vs. Obito"

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.370
This is the only thing the current me can do…

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:08.960
KAKASHI VS. OBITO Tune in again!
