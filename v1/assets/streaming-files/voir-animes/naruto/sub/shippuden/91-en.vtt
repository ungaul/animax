WEBVTT

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.700
I'm coming in, Tsunade.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.700
Jiraiya? Did you learn anything?

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.030
I discovered the whereabouts of the Akatsuki leader.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.870
What?! Is that true?!

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.400
Tell me more!

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.200
We'll use that information to plan a surprise attack!

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.670
Don't be hasty, now.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.370
This isn't like plotting a sequel to your novel!

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.930
We don't have the time to waste!

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.070
Haste makes waste.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.470
Especially with the stakes this high...

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.630
Say, why don't we grab a drink together?

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.330
Just you and me.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.500
I'll tell you everything there.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.730
You fool! I am the Hokage!

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.430
And you're asking me to go drinking in broad daylight?!

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.100
Have you no shame when our ninja are on duty?!

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.500
SAKE BAR

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.300
You know...

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.230
You really ought to take your own words a bit more to heart.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.730
Drinking sake straight out of the bottle...

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.700
Remember, you are the Hokage, right?

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.670
Twilight

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.770
That girl's late...

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.200
How long does it take to pick up supplies...?

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.870
I wish it would get dark soon...

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.200
After Jugo and Suigetsu turn in,

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.330
I'll make my move on Sasuke while he sleeps!

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.230
I'm so excited!

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.970
This feeling...

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.370
Well, Kiba?!

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.200
I'm concentrating, trying to single out Sasuke's faint scent!

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.470
So shut up! You're distracting me!

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.070
There's no mistake... They're steadily approaching.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.470
One...two...

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.800
Their chakra is strong too.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.200
There're quite a few.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.330
I sense non-human chakra too.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.270
Dogs?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.370
Are they tracking our scent?

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.000
Is it Akatsuki? Or maybe the Hidden Leaf?

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.470
INN OKOSHI Jugo.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.530
I'm gonna go check on Karin.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.900
Yeah.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.370
Wh-What...?

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.200
Wake up, Sasuke!

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.900
We're going to have company! What do we do?!

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.330
Sasuke just waking up...is also nice!

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.000
We escape... Get ready.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.030
Jugo, mark every Akatsuki hideout that we know.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.930
You're okay now, Sasuke?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.100
Yeah. I've been healing a lot faster since I absorbed Orochimaru's power.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.870
So this is the Power of the White Snake...

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.300
Whether it's Akatsuki or the Hidden Leaf,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.600
they might have information on Itachi.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.300
So why don't we ambush them, Sasuke?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.770
From what you reported about the number of people,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.630
it's most likely the Hidden Leaf.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.770
Akatsuki always work in two-man cells.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.230
Which means an ambush would be a waste of time.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.330
Exactly. Forget the Hidden Leaf.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.470
Then what'll we do?

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.430
Itachi is our only priority.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.000
Once we locate him, worse comes to worst,

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.900
you three must stop the Hidden Leaf.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.030
For now, team "Hebi" will use the information gathered by Jugo

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.430
and check out Akatsuki hideouts one by one.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.530
All right...

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.270
Let's go.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.300
Help me out for a second.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.600
With that?

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.670
Can you gather as many birds as you can?

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.200
What do you plan on doing?

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.030
This is Sasuke's old outfit.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.930
It's soaked with his sweat and smell, so we'll use this to...

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.670
Why would you have an outfit that Sasuke threw away?

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.900
Uh...! Th-That... That's not important... Y-You jerk!

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.500
A-Anyway...

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.970
I hate to do this, but...

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.270
Sensory-Type Ninja have different specialties

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.100
depending on their village.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.900
The Hidden Leaf often use ninja hounds.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.930
So we'll use that to our advantage.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.900
What's wrong, Kiba?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.070
Shoot! Sasuke is starting to move!

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.670
Let's hurry! Sasuke is going after Itachi!

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.030
Hold it, something's wrong!

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.270
Sasuke's scent is dispersing!

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.630
Not only that, it's scattering in all directions!

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.130
He's on to us. Taking strategic action.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.530
On to us? But how?!

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.870
I don't know what kind of power.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.670
But I'm guessing he has a skilled Sensory-Type Ninja on his side.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.370
The distance is too great,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.170
so I can't guide you through the wireless.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.100
I'm the only one who can pursue him...

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.230
But it's one scent. What'll we do?

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.970
I'll find him if I have to search every blade of grass!

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.900
With whatever means necessary!

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.570
Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.730
It's up ahead...

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.330
You guys wait until I give the order. I'll go and see.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.330
Who's that...?

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.600
Sharingan?!

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.030
Sasuke?!

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.070
Th-That's--!

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.970
Itachi...Uchiha!

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.670
Come on out... Naruto Uzumaki.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.070
You've come to capture me?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.200
No...I didn't. I just came to talk to you.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.430
Like I'd ever trust you!

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.400
When up against the Sharingan,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.770
if it's one on one, always run away.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.430
If it's two against one, get his back...

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.900
But in his case... Even while making a seal,

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.630
he can put his target under a genjutsu using only finger movements...

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.630
I have to be careful!

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.530
I know that you're alone. So why don't you run?

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.730
Hah! My numbers can go from one to a thousand!

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.100
Besides, I can't run away!

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.000
If I capture you, I get to see Sasuke!

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.930
Why are you so attached to my brother?

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.670
He's a Rogue Ninja.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.070
That's because unlike you...

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.630
I think of him as a brother more than you ever would.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.500
You're already under my genjutsu.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.170
Dammit!!

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.730
I'll say it again.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.170
I just wanted to talk to you for a moment.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.500
This Akatsuki leader is in the Hidden Rain Village, correct?

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:53.800
Yes.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.300
But that place conducts thorough checks of anyone entering and exiting their territory,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.770
and they track how long visitors stay.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.900
Just preparing for the Joint Chunin Exams is difficult each time

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.930
because the village is so closed off to others.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.330
Doesn't seem like a place where the Akatsuki leader can move about freely.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.100
However...because security is so strict,

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.530
they're able to keep other nations from learning about their internal affairs,

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.000
and hence, keep a lid on any shame.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.000
Shame?

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.400
It seems that land has seen much internal strife,

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.530
and the village itself has been split into two.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.500
Word has it that the leader of one side is also the leader of Akatsuki.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.800
That land is surrounded by

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.830
EARTH WIND FIRE the three great nations of Earth, Wind and Fire.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.270
And from ages past,

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.830
it has been the battleground of their conflicts.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.030
As a result, there has never been domestic stability

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.670
and the number of refugees is continually on the rise.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.100
That is why I will infiltrate

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.170
and verify the information we have gathered.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.630
Then we can plan strategy...

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.630
It's too dangerous to go alone!

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.330
I am one of the Legendary Sannin of the Leaf.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.030
You know what that means as well.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.100
I'm sorry...

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.830
that you always get the short end of the stick.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.730
What's with you?!

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:30.070
I'm saying, you were supposed to be Hokage.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.970
The Third Hokage always wanted you to be the next to--

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.230
I was never cut out for that sort of thing.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.200
Being on my own suits me too well...

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.970
You regretted not being able to stop Orochimaru.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.430
So all that time,

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.670
you were tracking his movements alone, isn't that right?

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.000
I no longer need to do so.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.600
That means I get to release the sequel to my novel sooner.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.000
Fact is stranger than fiction, isn't it?

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.300
Who would have imagined that Orochimaru would die...

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.330
Remember how the three of us would go up against Old Man Third and...

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:16.570
The flat-chested Tsunade has become the big-bosomed Hokage!

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.770
Times are changing by the second.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.300
You were beautiful back then...

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.430
and now, you're a fifty-something old granny.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.300
It pains me to see how all the memories of your lost friends and loved ones

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.900
are stored inside that big breast of yours.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.700
And you know, the number will continue to grow.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.730
I guess I shouldn't wallow in sadness.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.900
My duty is to be a model for the next generation

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.570
and to help them.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.200
For that, I'd happily give my life.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.600
It's what makes us old folks cool, see?

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.200
Wh-What's going on?

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.670
Aren't you after me? Then this is your...!

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.400
I'm going now...

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.070
I have an important task to do.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.770
Shadow Clone...

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.800
What was that?

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.630
Damn! This one's a bust too!

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.330
What's wrong, Naruto?

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.130
Oh, nothing...

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.070
Did something happen?

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.670
I just tripped.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.270
Never mind that. Kiba, track the next scent.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.930
Your drinking habits are worse than mine...

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.830
Want to stop and rest somewhere?

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.130
It's late. We have to go home.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:14.900
- Okay! - Okay!

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.370
Hey, wait up!

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.470
Akatsuki...

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.430
The leader is capable of organizing a group so powerful...

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.500
Who knows how strong he may be?

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.600
You'll be walking right into the enemy's territory.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.500
Well then... I should set out.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.800
Come back alive...

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.000
If I lost you too... I...

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.070
You'll cry for me? That'll make me happy!

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.770
But I doubt that it'll be like the time Dan died.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:56.900
You idiot!

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.200
Then how about making a bet with me?

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.300
You bet that I will die.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.270
After all, you always lose.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.670
But if I make it back alive...

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.230
Joking! I'm just joking!

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.630
You know, I'm grateful to you.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.800
Rejection makes a man stronger.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.100
MAKE-OUT PARADISE In other words, you can't call yourself a real man

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.700
unless you can laugh off stuff like that.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.370
Better yet, make a joke out it.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.470
So a man's duty is to be strong?

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.830
Kind of...

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:55.230
And besides... men aren't the only ones who seek happiness.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.130
Humph... Stop trying to act so cool.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.070
Without a woman, you guys can't be rejected.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.030
That's so true.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.800
If anything happens, contact me through your toad.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.470
I'll rush over myself.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.630
No need for that. You must not leave here.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.130
The village relies on you now.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.830
There are other candidates for Hokage.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.170
There can be no stability if the Hokage keeps changing.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.930
Right now, you are the only one who can be Hokage.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:51.800
There's Kakashi.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.500
And eventually, there's also Naruto...

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.800
You're really sold on Naruto, aren't you?

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.500
Although, I can understand...

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:10.630
Your kid brother Nawaki... Your sweetheart Dan...

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.830
- It's my dream to become Hokage. - It's my dream to become Hokage.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.670
And Naruto too...

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.100
I guess you could say they chased the same dream.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.700
Sure, Kakashi can step in.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.100
But Naruto still has a long way to go, even though you gave him your necklace.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.670
You have high hopes for him too...

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.470
You taught him the Rasengan.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.530
Oh that... Well, call it nostalgia.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.430
It reminded me of the days when I taught Minato.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.500
Minato Namikaze... True, Naruto does resemble him.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.500
Minato was a genius that appears only once in a generation.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.170
There won't be another like him.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.670
He was kind-hearted, but had nerves of steel.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.770
He rose to become the Fourth Hokage so swiftly.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.530
I've never been a parent, so I don't know much about these things...

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.270
but if he had been my son, I think I'd have been awfully proud.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:20.100
Now that you mention it... Naruto might not resemble him, after all.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.130
Rather than a son you boast about,

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.470
he'd be the problem child, always up to mischief.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.370
Naruto is more like his mother...

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.300
Wasn't she a former kunoichi from the Land of Eddies...?

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.930
Yeah... His personality and ninjutsu style is just like Kushina Uzumaki.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.830
Yes...that's her name!

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:46.330
That talkative, red-haired rascal... She was such a tomboy.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.900
Kushina grew up to be a beauty, but Naruto looks like his father.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.600
I can see Naruto's father in him...

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.070
To me, it feels as though I'm looking at my grandson.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.970
It is being passed on...

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.930
the will of the Leaf, from the past to the future.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.630
I guess I'll be off.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.570
Oh, that's right!

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.930
I had one last warning for you.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:30.830
Huh?

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.600
Beware of the Foundation.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.200
Yeah... I know.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.400
Ah... Good then.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.030
Farewell.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.500
Now, now, now!

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.400
Those from afar, listen carefully!

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.230
Those up close, come and see!

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:46.270
I am the super hot ninja of the Leaf!

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.470
I can hear the wild cheers of all the girls!

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.100
I may steal your hearts, but they won't shatter!

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.230
I help the weak and fight the strong!

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.830
Now let the tale of Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls begin!

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.970
Next time: "Tales of a Gutsy Ninja ~ Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls ~ Part 1"

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.070
TSUNADE'S ROOM

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.930
Now then, today's guest is... Hold it right there!

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.800
The most holy hermit sage of the spirit of Mt. Myoboku Toads!

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.100
I am the great Master Jiraiya!

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:20.870
Oh, it's you.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.370
What a greeting! Aren't you happy to see me?

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:27.330
Well, we don't have much to talk about.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.900
Don't say that. How about dwelling into my heroic tales?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.530
Heroic tales, huh...?

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.970
Yeah, something that'll make the women watching their TV shout for joy.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.330
You mean like long ago...

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.370
for the crime of peeking into the hot springs...

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.300
the Third Hokage made you sit for hours...

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.830
or the time you had a book-signing for your first novel...

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.330
it didn't sell at all and not one single soul showed up?

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.470
There must be more than that!

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.400
Hmm... Can't think of anything.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.930
I guess that's all I am to you, huh?

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.200
- Oh! - That's right. Tell them that!

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:01.630
Time's up. Goodbye.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.700
What?!

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.070
Tune in again!
