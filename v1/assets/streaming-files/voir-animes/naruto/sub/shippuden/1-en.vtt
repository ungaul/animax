WEBVTT

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.930
He's not in here.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.430
He's not in here, either!

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.630
He's not in here, either!

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.100
Where the heck...are you?!

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.100
We've finally...made it this far!

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.870
Where are you...?!

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.330
Where are you?

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.670
Sasuke!

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.430
Sakura, huh?

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.470
Sa...su...ke.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.400
Sasuke...

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.670
So it's you, Naruto...?

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.600
You don't even have parents or siblings...

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.600
What do you know about me?!

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.500
You've been alone from the start!

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.470
What do you know about me?! Huh?!

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.770
It's having the bond that makes it painful!

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.830
You've no idea what it's like to lose that...!

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.730
You're right.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.230
I don't know about having real parents or siblings...

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.400
If that's the case...

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.900
Why Naruto...?

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.770
Why do you go so far for me...?

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.030
To me, it's a bond... I've finally been able to establish.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.970
That's why I'll stop you!

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.800
If that's the case, then why didn't you...?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.670
Then I'll just break that bond!

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.770
Why didn't you kill me back then?!

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.530
Is that how you wanted to break the bond?!

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.670
Sasuke!

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.370
The reason's simple...

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.970
It's not that I couldn't break the bond with you...

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.370
You're one who might be able

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.800
to use the same Mangekyo Sharingan as mine...

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.200
However, there is one condition...

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.130
You must kill...

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.800
your closest friend.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.330
It was just irritating to me.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.270
Obtaining power according to the method I heard about from him.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.000
You're only alive because of my passing whim.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.000
When did he...?!

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.230
Come to think of it,

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.600
didn't you have a dream of becoming the Hokage...?

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.300
If you had the time to chase after me,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.830
you should've spent that time training or something...

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.400
Right... Naruto?

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.370
And that's why this time around...

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.270
You'll lose your life...

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.800
because of my passing whim.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.530
There's no way a guy who can't even save one friend...

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.270
can ever become the Hokage.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.930
Isn't that right...Sasuke?

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.870
Sasuke...!

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.330
Naruto...

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:11.130
Show him...our...powers.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.900
What's the matter...?

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.600
Why do you hesitate...?

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.330
You need my power, don't you?

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.470
Now then...

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.770
Who do you want to kill...?

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.300
You should know.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.400
That you can't do anything on your own.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.730
SEAL Break the seal completely!

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.770
I'll grant you all of my powers if you do.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.430
How...?!

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.730
I can see it now...

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.230
So this is your unknown power, huh...?

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.970
Who would've thought...

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.230
you'd have something like this inside of you...

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.370
I see... So you're an Uchiha...

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.900
My how you've grown...

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.100
To think you'd be able to see me within Naruto...

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.430
That loathsome Sharingan...

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.570
So that's the power of the cursed clan, huh?

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.300
It seems this isn't the first time you've seen the Sharingan.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.470
Then...you must be the Nine-Tailed Fox, huh...?

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.200
That vision, and Chakra more ominous than mine...

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.900
It's just like... Madara Uchiha, from long ago...

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.730
Heck if I know...that person.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.930
Homecoming Did you find it?

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.570
All clear here.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.670
Target acquired!

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.000
Uh-oh! It'll get into the village!

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.370
No way will we let it get away!

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.100
What the--?!

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.070
Where'd it go?

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.270
That way!

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.130
Hey, you squirts!

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.070
Hey!

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.670
W-We're sorry!

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.600
What're you doing?!

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.700
Sorry!

00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.800
Sorry about that.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.800
Ichiraku Ramen I'm going out for a small delivery.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.670
Whoa! Outta the way!

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.300
Sorry, pops!

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.300
Hey, Naruto!

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.270
No, I mean...

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.500
Konohamaru!

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.000
Konohamaru! We've cornered the target.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.030
Hurry up.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.270
It'll get away!

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.570
No problem!

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.600
Why you--!

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.170
- Give it up already! - Konohamaru!

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.630
I got him!

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.700
A ribbon on the right ear... No doubt about it.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.070
Ebisu Sensei, we captured the lost pet target "Dora."

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.800
Heh-heh... Mission complete!

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.970
Oh, my adorable Dora!

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.300
I was worried to death about you. Where were you?

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.900
I'd want to run away too,

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.900
if an old lady like that were my owner...

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.570
Konohamaru!

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.330
All right, here is the reward.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.470
Now then, let's go home, Dora.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.470
How many hours did it take you guys to catch a simple lost cat?!

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.570
But that cat was incredibly quick...

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.430
And he seemed accustomed to running away...

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.870
I don't want to hear any excuses!

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.200
A mission like this must be carried out more quickly and properly!

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.900
You guys are not good enough!

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.300
I can't display my true strength on a lame mission like this!

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.800
Say, Iruka Sensei.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.830
Don't you have more of an awesome mission for me?

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.300
Listen... Konohamaru...

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.570
Konohamaru, you guys just became Genin.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.800
There's no way I can give missions like that to you right off the bat, right?!

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.200
It'll be D-rank missions until further notice.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.870
I can't be satisfied with that!

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.330
After all, in the future

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.830
I'm going to become the Seventh Hokage.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.130
Seventh? Not the Sixth?

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.230
Brother Naruto's going to be the Sixth.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.370
Brother Naruto, huh...?

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.070
I wonder where he is right now...

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.270
I bet he'll return having become an awesome Shinobi.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.870
I have faith in him!

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.270
He's more of a Second Naruto than a Seventh Hokage...

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.830
Naruto... Are you holding up okay?

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.930
No matter what, I'll get strong and bring Sasuke back!

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.500
Quite a bit of time has passed since he said that

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.300
and went off for real training with Master Jiraiya...

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.300
Yes. Isn't it just about the time he should be returning?

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.570
We need him to return.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.130
After all, there will probably be significant developments sometime soon.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.100
Hey... Could that be...?

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.500
Yeah... No doubt about it.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.470
Miss Sakura!

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.070
Oh, Konohamaru!

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.570
Where are you off to?

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.430
The main village gate.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.630
I have to pick up the morning pedestrian traffic ledger for Lady Tsunade.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.230
You want to come?

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.470
It's been about two and a half years.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.700
Yeah, it has...

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.800
And then that Dora cat suddenly starts scratching me like crazy!

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.170
We had missions like that, too. It kind of takes me back.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.700
Come to think of it,

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.230
have you heard anything from Brother Naruto?!

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.670
Nothing...yet.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.130
I see...

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.200
He should be coming back soon, though...

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.800
Hello, Izumo, Kotetsu.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.530
Oh, look who's here...

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.200
Why don't you head on into town?

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.200
You'll see something interesting.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.030
Something interesting...?

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.300
Don't tell me!

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.000
He's having a ball...

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.770
This takes me back! The village hasn't changed a bit!

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:29.900
Everyone! Naruto Uzumaki's back!

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.270
It's all so nostalgic...!

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.930
Yup! Yup!

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.970
They added GrandmaTsunade's Mountainside Image!

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.500
For real...?

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.870
For real!

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.530
Naruto? Is that you, Naruto?

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.000
When did you get back, Naruto?!

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.430
Just now!

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.200
Long time no see, Sakura!

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.730
You've gotten taller than me, haven't you?

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:18.730
Huh...?

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.130
Oh! You're right.

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:26.330
He kind of...got a build since I saw him last...

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.530
So? You think I've become a bit womanly?

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.870
You're fine! You haven't changed a bit.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.300
You just don't understand the heart of a woman...

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.700
Brother Naruto!

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.600
Sexy Jutsu!

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:51.930
Ohh!

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.270
Wha--?!

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.800
How about that?! Pretty nice waist, hips and bust, huh?!

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.430
Konohamaru... I'm not a kid anymore.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.870
And you too, shouldn't be using Jutsu... like that...

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.730
That's right. It isn't just your appearance that's matured...

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.930
I kind of feel a bit lonesome,

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.430
but you've turned out quite admirable, haven't you, Naruto?

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:32.500
Knowing you, I bet you came back having acquired some incredible Jutsu.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.000
That's such a boring Jutsu!

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:40.530
Check out my freshly developed New Pervy Ninjutsu!

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.670
Right... Like the New Pervy Ninjutsu... Here we go!

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.830
Hey, you idiot!

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.500
You haven't changed at all, have you, you jerk?!

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.630
After seeing each other for the first time in like two years!

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.970
You make me do this in barely two minutes!

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.100
What am I supposed to do

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.030
with the feelings of admiration I had for you earlier, huh?!

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.900
- That short temper and incredible strength. - I'm not the least bit lonesome!

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.530
- She's a second-generation Tsunade. - Huh? God, I'm mad at myself!

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.900
Just like I thought, Sakura hasn't changed at all...

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.030
In fact, I get the feeling she's even more vicious than before...

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.130
Huh? Did you say something?

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.470
It's been a long time, you two.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.600
I'm sure your training produced good results, right?

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.470
Do you think we came back without making progress?

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.370
It went perfectly!

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.970
Then show me those results immediately.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.370
Show you...?

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.630
You will take on a particular man.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.030
I didn't send him on any missions for the past several days

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.700
and had him standby for this very purpose.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.800
Your opponent will be...

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.000
Come in!

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:04.900
Oh!

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.400
Today at around five in the afternoon,

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.600
Security Ninja were found collapsed

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.900
at the fortress of the Village Hidden in the Sand.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.600
No signs of dispute were found within the scene of the crime;

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.870
leading officials to believe the crime might have been committed

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.430
by someone in the village, or a skilled intruder.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.400
Around the same time, there have been reported sightings

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.930
of two men dressed in black clothing with red cloud patterns.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.470
They are likely connected to the incident.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.470
