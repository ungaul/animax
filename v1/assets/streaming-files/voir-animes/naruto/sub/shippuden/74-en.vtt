WEBVTT

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.170
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.370
Three Shadow Clones...?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.500
What's that?!

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.000
What a...high pitched...Chakra!

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.800
What...are they?

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.970
What is that Jutsu?!

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.270
If I get hit with that...then I'm... definitely doomed.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.070
Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.030
This is the end!

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.570
- Yes! - Yes!

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.170
I'll back him up, too!

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.900
No!

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.430
Don't get close to Naruto, or you'll also get caught!

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.830
So this is the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox's Jinchuriki...

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.970
A fitting Jutsu for a monster.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.000
What?!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.700
Damn--!

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.570
What...?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.100
What? Did he win?

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.770
Failed...

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.600
Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.870
Always the unpredictable Ninja. He did it again...

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.630
- Yamato! - Right!

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.800
I'll take your heart.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.870
Damn!

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.970
Damn it!

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.300
Gee... Acting really tough...

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.570
That is so Naruto...

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.970
Since it was called Rasen Shuriken or whatever,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.070
I thought you'd let it fly...

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.600
Do you have to actually run and punch?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.670
Hey! When it hits the target, it causes some serious damage!

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.070
It's called the Rasen Shuriken, but...

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.900
you must hit at point-blank range.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.500
That's why this Jutsu relies on Shadow Clones as a diversion.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.300
The duration of this new Jutsu is too short.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.500
It only lasted a couple seconds.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.730
Exactly.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.200
You'll never hit the target with that.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.330
Not against someone like him.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.900
That Nine-Tailed kid's Jutsu...

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.900
It seemed very powerful...

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.070
but I'll be safe as long as I keep my distance.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.030
As long as I avoid close-range combat and watch the one using that Jutsu,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.000
I have nothing to fear.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.330
Please let me try one more time.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.930
I'll finish him with my new Jutsu.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.800
You're against that "Akatsuki"!

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.800
If you do the same thing, he'll just dodge it again!

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.730
If he detects our diversion, we're done for.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.830
Let's fight him together...

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.500
That's true...

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.030
Our current situation, it's five against one.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.670
There's no need to take chances.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.170
So...what's their next move?

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.230
Kakashi Sensei...

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.930
Do you remember what you told me when I was training?

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.700
You said you believe I'm the only Shinobi

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.670
who can surpass the Fourth Hokage.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.800
Naruto...

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.330
I know teamwork is important.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.630
I also know that this is a very risky path.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.370
Even so, I want to take this risk alone.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.270
If I can't beat this, I'll never be able to grow up.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.270
So please...

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.130
Please...

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.970
don't take this path away from me.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.470
Yamato, what do you think?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.530
Yeah...

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.030
You haven't even seen it yet, after all.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.000
You haven't seen how he's a completely different Naruto now.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.900
Then it's settled...

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.630
Shikamaru...

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.370
Pakkun! What was that?!

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.530
They're close!

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.300
This is a sorry state...

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.300
How dare you do this to me?!

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.000
Lord Jashin will punish you for this!

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:18.000
A greater judgment will be handed down by Jashin himself!

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.170
That doesn't scare me.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.500
We believe in different things.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.700
I believe in the Will of Fire.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:44.630
But your god is not that stupid Jashin or anything.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:50.830
Now...I will hand down judgment...

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.400
You jerk...!

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:09.330
I told you, judgment will be handed down to you by Lord Jashin!

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:16.570
And I will carry out that judgment! I only need teeth to take care of you!

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.570
I'll chew you up into little pieces!

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.000
We found you!

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.230
Reinforcements, huh? But you were just a bit too late...

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.970
Wh-What?!

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.570
Shikamaru... You defeated an Akatsuki by yourself?

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.130
You're more impressive than I thought.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.500
I guess...

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.200
I just had to do this myself, no matter what.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.470
That's right...

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.830
What's happening with the others?

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.430
We came straight here, so...

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.670
Let's rejoin them quickly.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.770
Shikamaru!

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.530
Hey, are you okay? I'll heal you right now.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.430
This is no big deal...

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.570
But...!

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.870
I don't like troublesome things that hurt my friends.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.330
Let's hurry.
Yeah.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.330
Guys, please be okay...

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.300
Go, Naruto.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.170
Right!

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.930
That kid's going to attack again...?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.100
Just to be safe, I should switch to a long-range attack style.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:53.800
He didn't just change the shape of his body.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.730
He's built up quite a bit of Chakra.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.530
It's to counter Naruto's Jutsu.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.870
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.100
Here he comes...

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.570
It's ready!

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:45.570
He flew!

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.900
I can ignore the diversionary Shadow Clones behind me.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.500
I just need to aim for the original.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.570
I've nothing to fear if I can just smash that Jutsu...

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.170
No! He's reading him!

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.230
I knew he'd go with a long-range attack!

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.930
Naruto!

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.770
All right!

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.770
What?! That was a Shadow Clone?!

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.200
Huh?!

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.270
He mixed himself in with the diversionary Clones!

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.900
Eat this!

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.370
The blast is coming!

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.300
That was an extraordinary amount of attacks.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.030
I couldn't even count them all with the Sharingan.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.200
What a Jutsu...

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.530
- Awe... - Awesome.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.700
Naruto...

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:49.930
You...

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.630
You...finally...

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.130
All right... I did it.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.470
Shizune, did you notice that?

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.500
You mean Naruto, right?

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.470
Yes.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.030
I wonder what it is.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.270
I've seen various cases up until now.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.070
But I've never seen anything like that.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.630
What's happening with the body Kakashi brought back?

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.970
I have already sent it for an autopsy.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.570
Tell the person in charge to give it top priority!

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.470
Next episode: "The Price of Power"

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.070
How're you guys doing?

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.330
This is what we're going to try today.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.870
LET'S ALL TRY IT! SUMMONING JUTSU A summoning Jutsu.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.500
Summoning Jutsu?

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.730
Yes! It's a space-time Jutsu

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.070
where you make a contract with an animal and summon them whenever you want.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.470
You guys haven't made a contract with an animal yet,

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.830
so we'll just practice the seals today!

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.870
These are the seals you'll need...

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:31.170
Boar! Dog! Rooster! Monkey! Sheep!

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.570
Then you build up Chakra and slam your hand down

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.300
on the spot where you want to summon your animal.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.900
It's important to do it correctly and not rush.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.870
Now, let's all give it a try!

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.570
Okay. Boar! Dog! Rooster! Monkey! Sheep!

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.500
Slam your hand down.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.500
Hi! I'm Pakkun. I rushed here since I was summoned!

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.570
- Ooh! - Awesome!

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.630
To succeed, all you need is patience, effort and training!

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:59.270
It's not like Naruto could summon the Chief Toad right from the start.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.170
Train hard and master the Jutsu!

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.530
Okay, bye-bye!
