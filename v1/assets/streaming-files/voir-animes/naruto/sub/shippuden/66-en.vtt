00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.930
HOKAGE

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.600
Asuma...

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.730
Asuma!

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.530
Last Words

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.030
Asuma...

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.800
I'm finished.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.500
I'll just be another minute.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.070
Damn it...

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.930
Damn it...

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.600
You son of a gun!

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.800
Damn... I'm so powerless...

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.100
Feathers...?!

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.330
What the hell?!

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.730
Do you think you can beat us with crows?!

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.600
I wasn't born yesterday!

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.170
Blindfold!

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.670
A back sword!

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.070
Shikamaru!

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.730
We're here to help you.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.830
Ino...

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.470
Take Shikamaru somewhere safe!

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.530
Yes!

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.670
Don't let your guard down, Choji!

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.400
Okay!

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.330
Reinforcements...

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.570
Are you okay?!

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.930
Forget me. First Captain Asuma... Asuma Sensei!

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.670
He still has a heartbeat!

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.900
Choji! Take Asuma Sensei to the Hidden Leaf Hospital right now!

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.300
Ino, you go along with him

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.570
and use your Medical Ninjutsu to heal him as much as possible!

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.500
Hurry!
I got it!

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.300
Right!

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.800
I'm not giving up my bounty.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.230
Damn...!

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.800
We'll hold them back.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.970
Meanwhile, you get Asuma out of here!

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.500
You can struggle all you like, but you'll be sacrificed to God...

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.000
That's why...

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.930
Huh?!

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.630
Can't you wait a little longer?!

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.730
Seriously, it is just getting better.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.770
It's time to seal the Two-Tails...

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.970
Come right away! This is the top priority.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.700
See, I told you... It's almost there!

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.830
Knock it off, Hidan!

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.170
Are they communicating with someone?!

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.800
Tsk...

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.730
We'll be right back... Be prepared!

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.030
They're high maintenance...

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.700
Let's go, Hidan.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.200
Damn that pigheaded leader... I'll curse him next time!

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.430
What's going on?! Are they pulling back...?!

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.800
Sensei!

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.100
Asuma Sensei!

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.870
Ino, Choji! Hurry up and get Asuma out of here! Now!

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.470
I'm telling you!

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.770
Stay still until we get back!

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.830
He's about to die!

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.170
Later, losers!

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.870
Choji! Ino! Hurry up!

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.470
I'll use my Medical Ninjutsu!

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.130
Right!

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.400
No...more...

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.400
I'm done...

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.600
Even I know that...

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.970
You all must realize it, too.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.370
Shut up! Don't speak!

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.500
Ino!
Okay!

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.800
Ino...

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:43.470
Here...

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.300
And here, too?!

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.830
They got four vital spots.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.030
There's nothing more I can do...

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.400
Now I think I finally realize...

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.270
why the Third did...what he did...

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.530
I...always took too long...

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.830
I have some last words...

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:40.130
I'd like to say... to Ino, Choji and Shikamaru...

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.330
- Sensei, you shouldn't talk anymore! - Choji!

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.070
Ino, you, too.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.600
These are Asuma Sensei's last words...

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.900
Listen carefully.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.400
Ino...

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.500
Yes...

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.270
You're strong-willed, but dependable...

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.600
Both Choji and Shikamaru...

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.500
They're clumsy... so please take care of them...

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:26.430
Yes...

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.430
And don't let Sakura beat you...

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.730
Not in Ninjutsu or romance.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:38.900
Yes!

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.830
Choji...

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.870
You're a kind man who cares for his comrades...

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.300
That's why...

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.600
you'll become a Shinobi who's stronger than anyone else.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.430
Have more confidence...in yourself.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.800
Okay...

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.530
And...you may need to diet a little.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.830
That might be impossible, but I'll give it my best shot!

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.200
And...Shikamaru...

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.000
You're so sharp... and have great instincts as a Shinobi...

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.270
You could definitely become Hokage.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:32.170
Well...you're lazy... so you'd probably hate it...

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:42.130
I never once...beat you...at Shogi...

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.530
Oh yea, the story about the King...

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.030
If you were to liken the Leaf Shinobi to a Shogi piece, Shikamaru...

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.000
In the end, you would be a Knight.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.530
Then what would you be, Sensei?!

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.030
I'm nothing. I'm just...

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.900
A sacrificial piece...huh?!

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.030
Then...do you know who the King is?!

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:17.970
Huh?

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.370
The Hokage, right?!

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.370
That's what I thought until just recently...

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.130
But it's not like that.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.700
Then who is it?

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.030
You'll understand when the time comes.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:45.570
I'll tell you who the King is... Lend me your ear.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.830
Asuma...you...! That's why...

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.600
I'm counting on you, Shikamaru...

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.270
It doesn't matter now, does it?

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:16.730
Even though I quit smoking...

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.970
They're in my pouch...

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.230
I want one last smoke...

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.230
Oh! Sorry about that.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.000
I'm Asuma Sarutobi, and I'll be leading Team Ten from today.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.130
It's not going to be easy, so I hope you're all ready!

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.730
Oh, please don't cry! All I said was that I'm going to be strict!

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.070
The smoke is getting in our eyes!

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.370
BARBE-Q More rice! Also bring four more servings of kalbi!

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.130
Thanks for waiting!

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:33.230
Choji, have you ever heard of the word restraint?!

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.630
The bill went up to at least 3,000 ryo.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.470
I'm saying this not because I'm stingy.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.600
I'm just worried about you.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.600
If you keep eating like this, eventually you're gonna be fa--!

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.600
That word is taboo!

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.430
"Fa-" what?! Is there something wrong, Shikamaru?!

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:05.230
O-Oh... H-He said you can order the deluxe course meal.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.000
What--?!

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.800
Wow! Really?!

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.800
Asuma Sensei, thank you for treating!

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:17.930
Waiter, bring two deluxe course meals with extra rice, please!

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.330
I'm stuffed! I'm satisfied!

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:37.370
Here...

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:38.400
Oh...

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.730
Who're they for?!

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.300
Oh...nobody in particular...

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.070
S-See you later...

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.670
Say "Hi" to Kurenai Sensei for me!

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.630
What?! How did...you know that...?!

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.870
Shogi?! What a pain...

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.100
You can create a variety of situations

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.830
by utilizing the individual characteristics of the various pieces.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.730
It's the perfect game for a person like you

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.170
GUIDE TO SHOGI who's good at coming up with strategies.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.400
You should be able to figure out most of the rules

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:21.400
if you read this book.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.030
The rest you'll pick up as you play.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.430
It'll be troublesome, but... I'll have it down in ten minutes.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.100
I-I lost...

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.200
You don't have to go easy on me... Seriously.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.870
You're the only one who passed the Chunin Exam this time.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.500
As your Jonin team leader, I'm very proud of you.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.930
Ino and Choji, you two keep working hard!

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.500
Choji, Ino, you guys did well...

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.530
And now along with Shikamaru who passed last time,

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.670
all members of Team Ten are legitimate Chunin.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.770
And now...I will no longer be in charge of you guys.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.770
From here on,

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.970
each of you will become a captain and lead new teams.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.630
These earrings are my congratulatory gifts to each of you.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.900
Don't ever forget that you were members of Team Ten!

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.270
Sensei!

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.230
He died as a true Shinobi.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.300
After all... I hate cigarettes...

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:36.270
The smoke...gets in my eyes...

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:37.800
I see.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.930
Ah...how about Kurenai...?!

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.800
You guys inform everyone about the funeral.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.200
I'll tell Kurenai... No...

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.030
I'll do it. I'll let her know.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.970
Captain Asuma left me a message for her...

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.400
Next time: "Sad News"
