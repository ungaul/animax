WEBVTT

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.790
Though things did happen out of order.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.290
Oh well.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.790
So this is Sage Art Chakra…

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.060
Is that all there is to it?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.290
Seems like this will be easy to control.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.810
I'll be taking you all next…

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.710
you filthy beasts.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.270
The Hidden Heart

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.940
You know, staying here…

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.690
Yeah…isn't wise.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.640
Get away from here!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.100
Shukaku! Get ready!

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.770
Let's go wild!

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.770
Wind Style… Sand Bomb! Salvo!

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.850
Nice jutsu.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.890
But it lacks in finishing power…

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.350
So you implant your sand with this jutsu to stifle movement…

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.310
Now, Shukaku!

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.100
Grand Sand Mausoleum Seal!

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.190
It's a Mausoleum Seal

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.190
that uses my sand and curse mark pattern!

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.520
He sealed him!

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.770
Did it work?!

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.640
He'll never take another breath of fresh air again!

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.230
The Susano'o, huh!

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.560
I'll be putting collars on all of you shortly.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.850
Not one of you will be able to get away.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.520
I won't let you!

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.770
No one here's going to wag his tail for you!

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.560
Sorry we're late!

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.770
We were moving the injured.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.230
Don't worry!

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.560
There won't be any more wounded.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.270
We're ending this now!

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.020
Stack tails!

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.520
– Right! – Right!

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.310
You were close, you damned raccoon!

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.520
Quit ordering us around, you dumb fox!

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.440
But this should…

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.440
Persistent bastard!

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.730
But he's already taken a beating.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.690
All right! One more blast!

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.640
Yeah, let's go, Naruto!

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.350
Sorry I'm late, Lord Madara.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.690
You're finally here.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.350
Hey, that's Zetsu or whatever he's called.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.390
Reinforcements? Just one?

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.600
What's he doin' here now ♪

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.980
Isn't it kinda late? ♪

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.310
Do you have it?

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.640
Of course.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.770
This should make things a little more fun…

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.890
This taste of blood…this pain!

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.850
This is my body!

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:10.850
Finally… I can fully savor battle again!

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.730
What's wrong, Kurama?

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.770
His blood…

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.520
It's bringing back some really bad memories.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.230
Blood?

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.190
That repulsive blood that summoned me long ago.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.190
Hey, you dumb fox! Don't get scared and stick your tail between your legs!

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.390
I wouldn't underestimate him if I were you…

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.480
This isn't like you!

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.100
It's rubbing me the wrong way!

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.190
Summoning Jutsu!

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.640
Obito!

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.560
He's gonna fight us using that?

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.890
Kakashi, can you manage?

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.560
Yes, in one way or another…

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.600
Kamui!

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.980
Did it work?

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.140
I think…

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.100
it failed…

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.810
Not that thing again!

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.560
Seems the right arm's been wrenched off.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.690
Seems there's someone left with good eyes on the other side.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.560
Well, it's not much of an impediment.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.640
And now, I've got a pen for them.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.850
All I need to do is shove them in there.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.640
A fake Rinnegan from a reanimation can summon that thing?

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.770
He's bleeding and wounded.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.690
In other words, he's not a reanimation anymore.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.190
He possesses a real Rinnegan.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.520
How did he come back to life?!

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.560
Naruto, I'm grateful to you.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.560
You even extracted the Tailed Beasts from Obito,

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.230
saving me the trouble of weakening him.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.690
Don't tell me with Obito's Rinne Rebirth…

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.560
Now just come over, you bastard!

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.690
Everyone's power…

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.600
Don't you dare underestimate it!

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.500
Then Obito's…!

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.730
Obito…

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.560
He's fighting to prevent his Rinnegan

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.390
from falling into Madara's hands.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.770
You're stubborn, for someone near death.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:24.020
This left eye came to you through Nagato,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.230
but it's time for it to return it to its rightful owner.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.440
The only ones who have awakened the Rinnegan in this world

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.190
are the Sage of Six Paths and Madara Uchiha.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.390
It's not a mere thing to be hoarded by the likes of you.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.730
I've hidden the right eye…

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.600
And I'm going to have Kakashi destroy the left eye right now.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.600
White Zetsu found the right eye a while ago

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.690
and turned it over to Lord Madara.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.980
You're a useless fool who refuses to die…

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.350
So stop resisting.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.310
You'd be dead already if I wasn't sticking to you.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:26.770
Then detach from me and take the Rinnegan after I die.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:33.600
The instant I detach from you, these two will kill me.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.850
Before I can take the Rinnegan.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.690
Have you forgotten that I was the one

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.810
who gathered intel for Akatsuki?

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.890
I've already analyzed these two and their strength.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.060
It's going to take a bit longer for the left eye.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.480
Seems like it.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.730
This also looks like it's going to take a bit longer too.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.600
Don't compare me to that brat

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.730
who took years to get back those pets.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.690
You're covered in blood.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.810
Knowing that I possess Hashirama's healing powers

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.350
might cause me to fight crudely.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.140
Let's go!

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.020
Wait. We don't know how he's planning to attack.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.810
The Gedo Statue, huh…

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.940
I'll proceed more carefully.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.600
If I use the Rinnegan's true powers,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.230
we should see a more sophisticated battle.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.730
It will only be a few seconds.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.390
So watch closely!

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.770
Limbo…

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:46.940
Hengoku!

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.690
He might try something…

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.310
So be careful…

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.520
What is this? What just happened?!

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.520
Damn you…

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.690
The Tailed Beasts got knocked down!

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.520
Was it Madara's jutsu?!

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.520
That ought to have tamed you a bit.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.890
Now I can put on your collars!

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.390
Something's coming!

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.230
Eight-o!

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.310
Kurama!

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.190
First, I'll rip the Eight and Nine Tails from their Jinchuriki!

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.520
Eight-o!

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.520
Damn it!

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.560
That's right… If I just undo this Kurama Mode…!

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.890
It's useless.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.390
Once I catch them, I won't let them go.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.730
It's not working!

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.810
Kurama's not going back inside me…!

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.730
Damn it, I'm being pulled backwards!

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.190
Lord Madara, you must take them in order starting with the One Tail.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.980
I know that.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.140
Since you need to rip out the last two Tailed Beasts,

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.730
Eight and Nine Tails, from the Jinchuriki,

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.310
why not pull in the others,

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.350
the one tail through seven in the time being?

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:59.020
You bastard! I'm not letting you take Kurama!

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.560
You're right, it looks like this will take longer than I expected.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.480
So let's start…with this one!

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.100
Desert Hands!

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.520
You can't have Shukaku!

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:28.940
When you fall asleep, I'll take over your body and soul…

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.600
And slaughter all you humans!

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.310
Better not doze off.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.690
You hate humans?

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.350
Yeah! I despise them!

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.980
But… You're here to protect my village, aren't you?

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.520
I've never protected you all because I wanted to.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.060
You humans are less than us beasts!

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.560
Here's your meal, Shukaku!

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.690
Why do we have to stand guard over a creepy, weird monk

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.690
even though we're senior shinobi?

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:19.850
I know what you mean.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.390
But guarding the Jinchuriki means they recognize your skills.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.520
Just stop whining and deal with it.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.190
Poor damned monk.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.310
They don't even call you by your real name anymore.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.980
I don't really mind.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.100
Since you know my real name.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.690
You may be a monk, but don't you ever get lonely…

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:51.560
putting up with humans who hate you, and a beast like me?

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.390
Caged together with a man-hating beast

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.390
that's been with you ever since you were born?

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:04.230
Well, I'd die the moment I'm separated from you…

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.440
Since I'm a Jinchuriki.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.390
There's no need to distinguish between human and beast.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:17.270
That's because a friend of the heart provides peace of mind,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.140
no matter the species.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.190
You are one strange bastard.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.440
There isn't ever going to be another human like you again.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:27.890
No…

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.310
I think you're wrong.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.980
Human souls are like reflecting water.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.730
People often speak or act opposite of their true feelings.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.350
But essentially, the human heart wishes

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.060
to connect with and accept each other.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.480
Even with beasts.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.890
You know…

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:01.350
you really do remind me of the old man, Sage of Six Paths.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.480
Thank you.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:19.270
Those are the most heartwarming words I've ever received from you.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.640
Hurry up and eat, old man! We've got things to do here!

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.690
I really can't see there being others like you out there.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.640
I'm sure there are.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.480
And I know one day,

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.270
there will be someone who will protect, redeem, and shepherd you.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.310
And the moment you come to accept his true heart,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.310
you too will likely comprehend…

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.140
ACCEPTANCE HEART The meaning of these words my mentor etched onto my palms…

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.890
LOVE

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.310
Gaara, don't lose!

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.520
Until now, I've always considered you unpleasant.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.440
But it was because I was a Jinchuriki,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.350
that I was able to meet Naruto…

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.390
So there's one thing I'm grateful to you for now.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.230
You Sand brat!

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.520
Are you really that happy to have your old pet back?

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.270
How dare you interfere,

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.810
even when you're not going to die as a Jinchuriki!

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.390
My motto is absolute defense!

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.600
I've still got my pride as Shukaku!

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.690
I know…

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.850
No… you know nothing at all.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.100
People desire peace.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.640
And yet on the other hand, crave conflict as well.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.390
That's right, Hashirama's nation-building bore a paradox.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.060
People will sacrifice something in order to protect something else.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.940
Stop Madara! Don't you—!

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:59.060
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "A True Ending"

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.300
I gave you plenty enough time How unfortunate.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:08.940
Tune in again!
