Itachi's Story - Light and Darkness: Partner

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.850
Over there?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.010
Yeah.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.050
The "Akatsuki"?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.640
Don't know and don't care.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.680
Now get lost! You're keeping me from my "art appreciation" time.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.470
And I have to take this brat on as my partner?

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.970
Sure, he's full of energy,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.970
but he seems like the type to die young.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.220
It's our leader's orders…

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.680
His talent will be very useful.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.890
How do you know about my talent?

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.180
Just who the hell are you anyway?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.970
We know you're aiding anti-government factions

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.050
of neighboring nations with bombings…

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.050
You're a Rogue Ninja, but what is your purpose?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.100
Purpose? I don't need a purpose!

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.930
I take commissions to cause explosions…using my art.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.180
He's annoying…

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.510
Is he done?

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.260
Who knows…?

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.350
It doesn't matter.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.260
I'll do it.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.100
Let me make it clear, I won't stop in my pursuit of art!

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.180
Do as you please.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.850
But now that you're a part of the Akatsuki,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.800
I expect you to fulfill your missions.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.300
BLUE All right, all right, I got it.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.430
But…

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.680
you over there!

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.970
I'll never get caught up in your genjutsu again, hmm!

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.970
Now that you're one of us,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.640
I doubt that I'll have to use my genjutsu on you.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.720
I don't mind giving you a taste of my art.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.850
Leave it at that.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.390
Sasori!

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.010
Partner with Deidara and go kill Orochimaru.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.050
About time.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.430
Who is this Orochimaru?

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.760
I'll tell you on the way.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.260
Orochimaru has escaped into the Land of Wind.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.680
Beyond that, I don't know.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.680
That's all I need to know.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.800
Let's go.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.010
You Akatsuki sure like to order guys around…

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.100
Hey, hurry up.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.100
I know!

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.850
Itachi and Kisame, go to the Hidden Grass Village.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.850
What about my partner?

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.470
Wait just a while longer.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.350
I've ordered Kabuto to keep me updated through several ways.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.350
If they're headed to the Land of Wind, this is the spot…

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.260
The Great Sand Dune of the East… I see…

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.850
That's one place the guys from the Village won't go near.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.100
Is that where you're from, my man?

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.010
I don't want to talk about it.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.180
Anyway, that location works out perfectly.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.800
That's his hideout.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.260
I'll blow the whole thing up with my art, hmm!

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.890
We don't even know if he's there or not.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.720
Sand Snakes!

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.100
It's useless…

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.640
They know we're here.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760
Are you serious?

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.140
Let's go.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.510
I was expecting Itachi to be the one who'd come…

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.010
So you're the ones the Akatsuki sent?

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.760
We're going to kill you without hesitation, you traitor.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.470
Oh, do you really think you can?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.390
You're the boy from the Hidden Stone…

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.010
You used to be in the Demolitions Unit, right?

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.470
Don't treat me like a kid!

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.430
Keep watch from above and make sure he doesn't get away.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.970
What gives, my man?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.010
Are you saying that you want to capture him yourself?

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.890
Yeah, since you have no grudges against him, right?

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.180
If you want back-up, just call on me at any time, hmm!

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.300
THREE I have the geographical advantage here.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.010
So that's your work, my man?

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.430
You're aware of the Third Kazekage's power, aren't you?

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:45.890
Yes…

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.680
My hobby is to collect things that I find interesting,

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.180
so I took a little bit.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.720
THREE

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.010
What the hell?

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.010
Huh?

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.100
What's that over there?

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.390
Is that you, Sasori…?

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.050
You bastard, how dare you do this to me!

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.100
What's that, you damn snake?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.220
It‘s the Third Kazekage that you killed.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.680
I used a Forbidden Jutsu to resurrect him.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.390
Things won't go the way they did last time…

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.640
Enough of your resentful complaints…

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.600
Now then…

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.220
With your Human Puppet… and my Forbidden Jutsu.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.600
Let's see which is superior!

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.140
Damn you…

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.970
Iron Sand: Scattered Showers!

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.970
Unlike the real thing,

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.600
the puppet stops working when Iron Sand gets into it, right?

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.180
Don't lecture me about puppets!

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.300
Unlike the real thing,

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.800
I've built in lots of hidden tricks into the puppet.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.600
It's your turn…

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.970
Not yet.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.680
What?!

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.300
This is one form of immortality…

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.430
It doesn't die, even though it's already dead.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.640
There's no way it can't die!

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:15.680
Heargh!

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.970
Well?! How do you like my art?!

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.010
Why doesn't it die?

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:40.180
After you two die, I'll resurrect you both in the same way.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.220
Although, what I really wanted…

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.760
was Itachi's body.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.140
My man!

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.180
Does that guy have a weakness?!

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.140
Resurrection isn't one of the Third's abilities…

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.890
You are both going to become my pawns forever.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.050
Stop kidding around…

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.550
I…am the Third Kazekage…

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.300
I am not...

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.720
your pawn!

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.930
Oh my… I wonder if my jutsu wasn't complete?

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.930
Take this!

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.260
Is he dead?!

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.890
Don't run away!

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.720
Heargh!

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.010
Art is…!

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.550
…an explosion!

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.430
Hey, c'mon now…

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.010
We thoroughly searched the mountain of rubble,

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.390
but we didn't find his corpse.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.970
So we can't say for sure that we killed him.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.640
If he's alive, I swear I'll kill him myself.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.180
Besides, what was with that ridiculous jutsu?!

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.470
Do you know anything about it?

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.350
It's probably the Second Hokage's Reanimation Jutsu.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.180
You bring the dead back to life, and control them like a puppet.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.010
You can't kill it even if you tried.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.930
So you must use a Sealing Jutsu

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.390
or suppress their movement forcefully.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.010
We just have to kill Orochimaru, right?

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.970
Even that won't stop a reanimated being…

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.930
What's the supposed to mean?

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.970
Be wary of Orochimaru from now on.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.180
If he's alive, he's bound to make another move.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.930
Ordinarily, no one could survive that explosion, hmm.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.970
No one who joins us is ordinary.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.390
Another immortal has appeared out of the woodwork.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.600
We have a request from the Land of Steam.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.510
A homicidal maniac has appeared

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.970
and they want us to eliminate him.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.350
Don't they have their own Hidden Steam shinobi?

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.430
Apparently, they can't kill it.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.220
So this homicidal maniac is immortal too?

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.350
Was he "reani-whatevered" by Orochimaru too?

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.930
I'm dispatching a different team this time.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:54.890
You there…

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.510
Would you like to join the Way of Jashin?

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.510
This wasn't for money or revenge.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.970
This was out of a deep desire to kill.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.640
There are other ways to quench blood thirst…

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.260
He had some other purpose.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.970
You really have a way of irritating me.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:31.100
And you… Did you come to make sure I don't kill Itachi?

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.850
There are no other Sensory types besides me.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.680
And… The others certainly aren't cut out to be decoys.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.760
Decoys?

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.260
All right then…

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.640
Hey, you over there.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.970
Do you want to join the Way of Jashin?

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.050
Way of Jashin?

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:01.970
Yeah, the Way of Jashin…

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.300
What is that?

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.470
You can kill people and you won't be punished.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.600
In fact, it just pleases Lord Jashin even more.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.600
I see…

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.140
What do you say? Isn't that a wonderful teaching?

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.850
Are you interested in joining?

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.760
So you're the homicidal maniac…

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.680
Homicidal maniac? That's not it at all.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.100
I'm just offering up prayers to Lord Jashin.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.470
Looks like I'll just have to offer you up to Lord Jashin.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.140
Well?

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.720
He doesn't seem to be a Reanimation.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.390
Fine. I'll test him to see how immortal he is.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.510
Who are you guys, dressed up all the same?

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.890
You in an orchestra or band or something?

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.260
Let's see… The gloomy one over there plays bass…

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.800
The girl does vocals and keyboards…

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.850
No, maybe that guy there does vocals?

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.760
We're nothing like that.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.260
I think Lord Jashin would like you guys as an offering.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.100
What's wrong? Is running around all you can do?!

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.680
Well, I won't let you get away!

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.140
What? Done so soon?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.260
Ouch…

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.350
That hurt!

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.100
Oh…

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.390
I'll punish you in the name of god!

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.140
That's not gonna help you!

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.600
Looks like the rumors about your immortality are true.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.260
Okay, let's start the ritual.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.970
Everything is ready!

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.220
Die…!

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.390
One stab into the heart…

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.720
Damn you!

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.510
It feels so good…

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.850
Glory be to Lord Jashin!

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.100
You bastard…You got some nerve…

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.390
Hey, hey… Why didn't you die?

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.300
I'll beat you to death!

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.100
No, you can't!

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.510
Did you notice anything?

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:04.760
He licked Kakuzu's blood

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.260
and then mentioned something about a ritual.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.180
That's probably some jutsu too.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.850
He passes on any damage he sustains to the one whose blood he licks.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.550
However, that doesn't explain his immortality.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.180
Can you separate them?

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.140
Weren't you going to eliminate him?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.720
Yeah.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.100
W-What?!

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.300
What's the big idea, Itachi?!

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.140
Seems they're recruiting him.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.140
A guy like him?

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.100
Are you kidding me? I refuse!

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.390
Whatever the Akatsuki is…

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.640
I have a mission to spread the Way of Jashin.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.680
Then you should join the Akatsuki for the sake of your mission too.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:57.510
What?

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.180
Assassinations, war, you name it,

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.930
the Akatsuki will do anything… since we're a band of killers.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.470
I plan to continue propagating the Way of Jashin.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.100
Do as you please.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.220
THREE Our two-man teams are in place.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.720
Go and execute your missions.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.010
I didn't expect to be partnered with you.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.260
You took the words out of my mouth.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.300
Don't irritate me, or I'll kill you.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.100
Like I said. Just try it!

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.430
I don't want your heart.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.260
Art…

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.430
…is an explosion!

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:08.850
It's art!

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.390
I still don't get what your art is about.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:17.970
Soon, you'll understand the aesthetics of something that's fleeting, hmm.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.930
Hm? It's the leader.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.180
A shinobi village named the Hidden Sound

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.550
recently came into existence.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.550
It's possible that Orochimaru is involved.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.010
That guy!

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.680
I want you two to covertly check them out.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:41.100
Since you guys specialize in sneaking around behind the scenes.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.140
I'll find him!

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.550
And make him go boom!

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.010
The orders were to do it covertly.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.930
There's been an incident at the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.760
Orochimaru's behind it.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.300
Orochimaru used shinobi from the Hidden Sound and Hidden Sand

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.550
to wage war against the Leaf…

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.220
But he failed to completely destroy the Leaf.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.350
Serves him right!

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.850
The Third Hokage was killed in battle.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.760
Orochimaru withdrew, but his whereabouts are unknown.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.180
I'll send someone out to investigate, but… I'll go.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.010
Then I'll leave this to you,

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.260
as well as the status of the Leaf's Jinchuriki.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.550
It seems they averted total destruction,

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.140
but they've sustained massive damage.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.180
That Village was at the height of prosperity…

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.550
How tragic.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.050
That was out of character.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.350
So even you have feelings for your birthplace, after all?

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.390
No…

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:04.970
Not at all.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.010
Sasuke… Are you safe?

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.150
It's been a while Sasuke.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.900
Itachi Uchiha…I'm going to kill you!

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:58.450
Ah, the Sharingan.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:03.950
Nevertheless, he's a lot like you. Who is he?

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.320
He's my younger brother.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.280
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Truth"

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.820
Has your Sharingan awakened?
