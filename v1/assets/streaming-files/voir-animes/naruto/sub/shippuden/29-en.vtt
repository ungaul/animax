WEBVTT

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.670
He was formidable.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.530
I'd expect no less of my imposter.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.630
I did it...

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.800
Yes!

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.600
Everyone! Have things been settled?

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.330
Yes, Guy Sensei!

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.100
- Yeah... - Naturally!

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.030
All right! Now we head off to back up Team Kakashi!

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.900
- Roger! - Roger!

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.430
Granny Chiyo!

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.930
Granny Chiyo...

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.200
I'm not surprised...

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.770
Sasori's poison could knock her out at any moment...

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.770
We've finished what we were supposed to do.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.630
We need to return to the village and neutralize the poison immediately...

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.300
More importantly, I've still got...

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.570
something I must...do.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.100
It's probably...that powerful will that's keeping her conscious...

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.830
But...what is it she has to go this far to do?

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.630
I'm sorry...

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.830
Here we go!

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.430
They're following me.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.070
Shall we do this?

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.570
Naruto.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.430
Get back...a little.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.300
Got it.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.530
Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.730
Kakashi Enlightened! 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.200
Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.970
What is...this?!

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.230
A Vision Jutsu...?!

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.130
Oh no!

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.770
What is this Jutsu...?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.770
It's amazing...

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.070
You won't get away!

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.570
Damn it!

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.070
Damn it...!

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.300
My arm's getting sucked into space...?!

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.970
What kind of Jutsu is this?!

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:39.970
I missed...

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.400
I guess I still can't control the location or size

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.270
of the dimensional barrier very well...

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.170
But I won't...miss next time...

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.300
Damn it! I let him get away!

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:50.570
I shook him off, huh?

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.730
Rasengan!

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.200
All right!

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.770
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.070
Gaara!

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.770
Gaara! Gaara!

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.270
Kakashi Sensei, you all right?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.670
Yeah... somehow...

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.930
Gaara. I'll get you out now.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:09.900
Gaara!

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.830
It looks like they came through here.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.000
Yes. They were probably going after Gaara who was taken...

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.030
You jerk...!

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.170
Hey! Gaara! Are you listening?!

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.000
Knock it off!

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.270
That's enough, Naruto!

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.170
You should know...

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.700
That's right. You know, don't you?

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.400
He's been dead for a while.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.300
Please hurry.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.230
Right!

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.100
Please let me know if it gets too painful.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.400
I will...

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.000
Lee...!

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.800
I'll leave you behind if you drag your feet, Tenten!

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.830
What're you talking about?!

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.570
I was waiting for you guys to catch up!

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.500
I see. Naruto and the others should be expecting us

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.170
to rendezvous with them.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.400
So let's hurry!

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.270
What? We should wait for Guy Sensei and Neji...

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.270
We don't need to worry about that.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.070
Huh?!

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
You're late, Lee, Tenten!

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.030
Oh! It's your fault they got ahead of us, Tenten!

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.030
Hey! Hold it, Lee!

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.000
Kakashi! Can you hear me? Hey, Kakashi!

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.130
Just as I thought. The radio isn't working.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.000
Neji, what's happening with Kakashi and the others?

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.500
It looks like they're still fighting the one from the Akatsuki...

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.270
But it seems they've succeeded in retrieving the Kazekage...

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.130
However...

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.570
However?!

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:42.930
Gaara...

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.270
Gaara!

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.900
Hey... Hey, Gaara!

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.070
Gaara!

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.830
I told you, didn't I? He's already dead.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.770
It was fine using the Kazekage as bait to lure out the Jinchuriki.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.870
But I didn't plan on...

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.530
him coming along...

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.500
My left arm...

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.830
Sand Prison!

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:04.030
was crushed by the Sand Jinchuriki, and even my right arm, too...

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.900
Now I can't even use a Jutsu.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.400
I guess this is it...

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.900
But...I never thought there was anyone with Visual Jutsu as good as Itachi.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.470
This Jinchuriki's nothing special.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.530
Kakashi's the more important issue...

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.530
I'll pound you!

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.200
Fine, fine.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.970
I'll take you on again one of these days.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.730
You let your guard down...

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.400
Oh no!

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.100
Yes!

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.670
I told you that you let your guard down...

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.570
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:41.630
Naruto...

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.230
It's clay... Was it a Substitution?!

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.770
That's...!

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.000
Get a handkerchief ready.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.100
The next episode features a raging conclusion

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.530
that will leave you in tears.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.600
I show great concern for my foolish pupil from afar.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.770
My finally-honed foresight will save Naruto with the power of love!

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.570
Oh, I'm involved in this too,

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.500
so make it the love of his two masters that saves him.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.970
Then how about, "Love Saves the Foolish Pupil,"

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.970
for the title of the next episode?

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.230
Excellent, Master Jiraiya. Let's go with that.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.370
You're okay with this, right, Naruto?

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.430
Next time: "Aesthetics of an Instant"
