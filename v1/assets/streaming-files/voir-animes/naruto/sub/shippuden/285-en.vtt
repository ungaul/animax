00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.820
Sasuke's Story: Sunrise, Part 3: Fuushin

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.820
What is that?!

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.650
Get away from him!

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.450
So that's the Sharingan.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.950
What a surprise.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.900
Sasuke using his Sharingan to save someone's life…

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.280
Huh?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.110
W-Watch out!

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.820
What happened?!

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.030
Lady Himeyuri!

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.860
Just what is going on?

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.360
Leave one of them to me!

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.400
We can't save them… but we can lessen the damage!

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.070
How bothersome.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.740
Chino!

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.400
What is it?

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.740
I didn't expect you to save me… Sasuke dear.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.400
Thank you.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.700
Chino!

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.570
Are you okay?

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.320
I'm fine, I'm fine... Ow!

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.820
You need to get that taken care of.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.990
They're the Exploding Humans that attacked the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.990
They're quite troublesome.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.240
I can't make contact with him, so I'm going to get going.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.860
Looks like you won't get to meet Oyashiro.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.030
What?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.860
I told you, didn't I? He's a very cautious man.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.950
I can't imagine he'd stick around after all this uproar.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.820
And since the match ended midway,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.860
there won't be an ID tag transfer ceremony either.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.110
Besides, we won't be able to get any intel on Fuushin,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.650
who belonged to Oyashiro's former guard unit,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.860
who's making all these Exploding Humans.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.950
This has been a total waste of time.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.950
Lord Orochimaru.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.900
What did you say?

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.400
Sasuke…

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.740
Oyashiro is asking for you.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.610
Go on ahead.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.900
What about you?

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.320
I'm going to get this wound looked at.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.650
I'll stick with Chino.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.360
All right.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.780
Oh, hello!

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.900
I am En Oyashiro.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.950
Nice to meet you!

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.200
Is he really En Oyashiro?

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.070
There's no mistake.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.900
It's been a long time, Mr. Orochimaru!

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.610
When was the last time we were face to face like this?

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.610
It's been so long, I don't remember.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.820
What's going on?

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.820
I don't recall you being someone

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.780
who'd reveal himself so casually before others like this.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.820
It's only because I witnessed something very interesting.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.780
Though it was quite a shock to see humans explode like that.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.780
They're just like the Exploding Humans

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.700
that attacked the Hidden Leaf, right?

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.820
You know about that?

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.070
You can't be in my line of business

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.070
if you're not on top of the news.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.110
They appeared because they were after you, right?

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.320
Perhaps, this time.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.820
This time?

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.860
Are you saying that they attacked the Hidden Leaf Village

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.110
for a different purpose?

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.610
I mean, doesn't it seem like it?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.030
They attacked the Hidden Leaf Village with me as their target?

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.320
The man creating the Exploding Humans

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.490
seems to be a former member of your guard unit.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.320
What? No way!

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.780
His name is Fuushin.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.900
You know him, don't you?

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.030
Hmm… That kid?

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.360
He initially belonged to someone else.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.610
Someone else?

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.700
I won him at the Coliseum and assigned him to my guard unit.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.610
I believe he was born on a small island in the Land of Water.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.110
When he was young,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.030
he was sold off by the islanders because they were scared of him.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.950
Sold off?

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.700
Isn't that how it is with the Kekkei Genkai?

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.320
Weak humans who consider themselves "normal"

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.360
always fear unusual power.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.070
It's a disadvantage from the moment you manifest it.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.450
Though personally, I like Kekkei Genkai.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.030
I mean, they're powerful and rare!

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.780
That's why I've collected all different kinds for my guard unit.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.820
I've even slaughtered the rest

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.490
and left only one to increase the rarity…

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.990
The only thing is,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.320
because of the difficult situations surrounding their upbringing,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.950
many of the kids were rebellious.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.860
If I didn't know Medical Ninjutsu,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.030
I probably couldn't have tamed them.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.860
Fuushin was a relatively good kid,

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.610
but one day out of the blue, he took the other kids and ran away.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.450
I wonder why he ran away?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.530
I fed them every day and even gave them an allowance.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.900
I've heard enough!

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.820
Did Fuushin have red eyes?

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.150
Red eyes?

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.530
Oh, now that you mention it…

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.450
One of the kids who ran away with Fuushin had eyes like that.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.070
Ran away with Fuushin?

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.070
So Fuushin has a partner?

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.900
Was that Genjutsu Trap his doing?

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.280
What was his name?

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.950
I've forgotten.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.150
Then remember.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.900
You're so harsh!

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.740
Oh, I know!

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.650
That kid was from the Chinoike Clan.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.360
The Chinoike Clan?

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.030
What is that?

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.610
It's a tragic story.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.030
I don't care, tell me.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.610
It goes way back…

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.320
Even before the time Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha competed for power.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.820
Bloodshot eyes…

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.820
The Chinoike Clan with their Ketsuryugan.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.110
They lived in the Land of Lightning.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.280
They were especially proficient with genjutsu

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.860
and once you were caught in their Visual Jutsu,

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.400
it was said you could never escape.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.860
Anyway, one of the Chinoike Clan women was sent

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.110
to become the concubine of the feudal lord of the Land of Lightning.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.570
She was personable and beautiful…

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.820
and that made the lord's consort terribly jealous.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.360
Unfortunately, shortly after taking the girl as his concubine,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.900
the feudal lord became ill and died.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.530
"It's her fault he died!"

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.650
The lord's consort put all the blame on the concubine.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.820
And those who knew about the Chinoike Clan's unusual genetics,

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.860
supported the consort's claim.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.450
As a result, the girl and her entire clan

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.950
was exiled to a place known as Hell Valley.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.110
And for that, the consort hired…

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.280
What's the matter?

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.200
The Uchiha Clan.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.320
What did you say?

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.280
The Uchiha Clan with their Sharingan were the only ones

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.450
who could go up against the Chinoike Clan

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.400
and their unique Visual Jutsu.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.070
The Chinoike asked the Uchiha to set up a meeting place to negotiate,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.110
but were rejected.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:36.570
Seems the Uchiha Clan who suffered long through persecution

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.820
were also complicit in the persecution of others.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.450
What about Itachi?

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.820
Was Itachi aware of this?

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.860
I wonder…

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:50.990
However…

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.280
you may learn something if you go to Hell Valley.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.860
Where is Hell Valley located?

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.110
It's in the Land of Steam.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.360
Are you going?

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.450
I don't know.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.900
I guess not.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.320
You don't know if Fuushin is actually there.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.990
But I'm rooting for you. Good luck!

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.990
We need to get rid of nuisances like Exploding Humans as soon as possible.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.900
That's unusual.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.530
I didn't expect to hear that from a weapons trader like yourself.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.610
If a convenient explosive like that became commonplace,

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.280
I'd be forced to shut down my business.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.950
Just as guilty…

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.570
That's what you said.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.650
Huh?

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.200
To a victim, the assailant and a third party are no different.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.990
People are no better than the assailant if they didn't try to help.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:21.320
If you only pity the loser

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.860
and do nothing to stop the decadence of the rich…

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.900
you're just as guilty, Sasuke.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.780
It's just as you said.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.030
But…

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.280
"But"?

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.360
No, never mind.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:05.400
Hey, you probably won't tell me… But I'll ask anyway.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.110
Where are you headed this time?

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:09.900
Hell Valley.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.700
See? You didn't tell me…

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.240
What? Hell Valley?!

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.950
The one making Exploding Humans is there?

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.740
Probably not.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.490
Then why are you going?

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.610
I want to see this Hell Valley with my own eyes.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.900
As the last survivor of the Uchiha Clan.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.860
Huh?!

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.110
We came all the way here to the Land of Steam,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.900
and we're not gonna soak in the hot springs?

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.200
You two can do whatever you want.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.150
This is where we go our separate ways.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.610
But why?

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.610
The one making the Exploding Humans is after me.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.320
It's better if you're not around me.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.900
We came all the way here together.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.450
As if we'd desert you now, Sasuke dear.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.240
We're going with you to Hell Valley!

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.740
Exploding Humans!

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.900
Sasuke dear!

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.450
Stay away!

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.990
Nowaki, let go!

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.860
He's… not cloaked in chakra.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.400
Hot! So hot...!

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.400
Hot! So hot!

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.110
You're not Fuushin, are you?

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.780
W-What're you saying?

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.320
I'm the Lightning Gang's… I possess the Sharingan.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.990
I can look into your memories with this.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.530
If you're lying, I can't guarantee that I'll spare you.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.950
Fine.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.320
Won't guarantee my life?

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.150
Well, I'll say it right back at you!

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.990
Whoa... I won't let you.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.990
Earth Style: Mud Wall!

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.700
Lava Style: Rubber Wall!

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.530
Rubber is strong against the Lightning Style!

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.530
Lava Style: Rubber Sphere!

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.860
All right…

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.740
Let's do this!

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.990
It starts now!

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.860
What?!

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.490
Then I'll just increase the amount!

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.860
Amaterasu.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.320
W-What the hell this?!

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:51.200
I-It won't go out!

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.200
Hot! Hot!

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.240
I-I'll tell you anything you want!

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.860
I'll talk! Please let me talk!

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.320
So please put out the flames!

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:02.450
Hot! Hot!

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.490
Kagutsuchi…

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.450
You don't have to talk.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.530
"I need your help…Fuushin."

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.650
Just hold on, Boss!

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.570
So you want me to make this Sasuke guy think

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.360
that I'm after him?

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.900
I figured as much.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.070
That's right.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.820
That chakra sword was

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.610
the same as the chakra sword you threw at me at Bamboo Village.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.780
Show me what you really look like…

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.740
"Really look like"?

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.820
That's not your real appearance.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.700
Otherwise,

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.490
you wouldn't have shown yourself before Old Man Iou in the Bamboo Village.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.450
Still, were you that scared to see En Oyashiro?

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.990
Indeed… This is how I really look.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.570
Fuushin!

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.620
I certainly didn't expect it to be you.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.870
People who have Kekkei Genkai are all special, right?

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.210
Because this power leads to fear, the rift between people widens

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.920
and they deem you unpleasant and evil.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.790
I'll make you tell me the entire story.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.620
Before that, let me blow you up…

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:05.170
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Sasuke's Story: Sunrise, Part 4: The Ketsuryugan"

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:07.420
Susano'o!

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:28.580
Tune in again!
