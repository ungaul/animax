00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.370
Naruto! Where are you going?!

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.330
If Pervy Sage had been the Fifth Hokage...

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.600
he wouldn't have let Granny Tsunade take such risks...

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.200
Never!

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.370
Naruto!

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.230
Sakura... It's all right. Let him be.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.000
But...

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.200
I can see that child truly loved and admired Jiraiya-boy.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.830
I can't help but hope that he is the Child of Prophecy.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.930
Following the Master's Shadow

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.470
I'm sorry...that you always get the short end of the stick.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.400
What's with you?!

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.100
I'm saying, you were supposed to be Hokage.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.500
The Third Hokage always wanted you to be the next to--

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.300
I was never cut out for that sort of thing.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.000
Being on my own suits me too well...

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.770
You regretted not being able to stop Orochimaru.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.470
So all that time,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.500
you were tracking his movements alone, isn't that right?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800
I no longer need to do so.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.070
That means I get to release the sequel to my novel sooner.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.200
Tsunade-girl... Tsunade-girl!

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.870
Are you all right, Master?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.300
Yes, I'm fine.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.570
I'm sorry.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.330
You just received sad news.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.930
I don't blame you for feeling distraught.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.100
However, you have the important duty of protecting the village.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.930
This is where you must stay strong.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.930
Yes...

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.100
Anyway, the clues left by Jiraiya-boy...

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.070
There is something besides the hidden message on my back.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.330
A Hidden Rain Ninja captured by Jiraiya-boy is inside his belly.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.170
And, one more thing...

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.170
Inside this fellow is one of Pain's bodies that Jiraiya managed to kill.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.270
Pain's?

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.300
"MAKE-OUT TACTICS" LONG-AWAITED NEW NOVEL BEST WORK EVER

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.430
Oh, there they are!

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.130
So many well-developed gals!

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.770
Hey! What're you doing, Pervy Sage!

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.600
What a sight! What a sight!

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.330
I'm getting inspiration for my next novel!

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.070
AUTOPSY ROOM

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.770
This is Pain...

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.730
The ripple pattern... Is it the legendary Rinnegan?

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.230
That's correct. If we study it well,

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.200
we may find clues on how to defeat him.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.270
A ninja's corpse is a treasure trove of information.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.670
We will gather skilled Medical Ninja, and begin an autopsy immediately.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.770
Shizune.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.600
Yes, ma'am. I will take care of it.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.000
Hmm... That is a good photo.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.370
I have given you all that was entrusted to me.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.870
Yes, indeed.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.230
I will return home now. Let me know what you learn.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.530
With Jiraiya-boy's student here,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.370
you will be able to contact Mount Myoboku.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.670
Thank you very much.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.130
I promise that we will find a way to defeat Pain!

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.830
Now listen, Naruto.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.370
I have only three years to make you strong.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.200
I will spend that time training you vigorously.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.470
Be prepared for that.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.570
You bet! This time, I'm going to bring him back for sure!

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.270
There's no time for me to waste.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.770
Cripes... I can't stand this...

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.530
What is this?! What's with this lame training?!

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.870
Fool! Nothing in training is lame!

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.830
You foolish student!

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.470
You're mine!

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.900
You're not the only one who uses Shadow Clones.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.470
You're still so naïve...

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.270
Damn! I was so close!

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.430
Liar. It'll take a hundred years before you can beat me.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.930
I can't wait a hundred years!

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.730
Just wait... Next time...

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.470
This is super-cool!

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.700
Hmm... Fine feathers make a fine bird, eh?

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.430
Yo! Naruto.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.700
I hear you've been real active on missions and such.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.870
Everyone in the village is talking about you.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.530
Hey, let's go somewhere and catch up!

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.000
How about Ichiraku for some ramen?

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.170
No thanks...

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.100
What? Right now?

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.570
Yes. Take that, and go immediately.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.130
The Cipher Corps folks don't work this late.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.000
Summon them and tell them it's on my orders.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.770
I'm putting you in charge of this case.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.100
I know it's a very important encryption,

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.930
but can't you ask someone else who's not on a mission right now?

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.300
Wait... Where are you going?

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.600
I came here on a different matter.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.600
Shikamaru!

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.000
But...

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.530
Lady Tsunade has been busy since morning, and...

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.070
Well, the same goes for me.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.700
Shikamaru, please...

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.270
I must say... You've grown even more beautiful.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.730
You haven't changed...

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.600
But... If you try anything to betray the village...

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.830
At that moment, I will kill you.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.530
Then how about making a bet with me?

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:12.300
You bet that I will die. After all, you always lose.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.330
But if I make it back alive...

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.470
Joking! I'm just joking!

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.700
You know, I'm grateful to you.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.370
Heya... I'm Jiraiya!

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.600
You can send me the love letters later!

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.030
Nice to meet ya!

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.900
You fool...

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.770
24-HOUR CONVENIENCE STORE

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.600
Naruto...

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.470
I heard about Lord Jiraiya.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.930
I wanted him to keep watching over me.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.730
I wanted him to see me become the Hokage.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.170
But I only ended up showing Pervy Sage the worst, most un-cool side of me.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:50.430
I was... Lord Jiraiya only had praise for you.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.770
He was always boasting about you,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.200
saying you were like his own grandchild.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.830
He had faith that you were the one who would inherit his will.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.170
And truly believed that

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.200
you would one day become a great Hokage.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.070
Lord Jiraiya will always watch over you.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.170
Even this very minute, he's watching from somewhere.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.100
He wouldn't be happy seeing you sad like this. So...

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:25.770
Be your usual self, the one he praised so much.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.670
Don't stay depressed forever.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.800
For Lord Jiraiya himself, one of the Legendary Sannin...

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.270
acknowledged you as his promising student!

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.530
Thanks... Iruka Sensei.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.430
Thank you for your efforts. How's it going?

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.830
Oh... I checked very carefully...

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.200
But this isn't a Hidden Leaf code.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.130
It doesn't correspond to any of our algorithms.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.830
But considering the fact that Lord Jiraiya wrote this

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.500
in his dying moments,

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.330
I don't think it could be anything too complex.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.730
It's a string of numbers,

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.300
so it has to be a shared-key encryption.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.300
Can you...decode it?

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.830
Ahem.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.170
Err... Frankly, it's impossible unless we know the key.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:46.630
Key?

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.330
Namely, if you don't know the rules that define the code,

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.870
you can't break it.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.630
Unless we know something about Lord Jiraiya

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.130
that could be the key, it's impossible.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.970
So how do we figure out what the key is?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.370
I wouldn't know...

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.600
But perhaps someone who was close to Lord Jiraiya

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.230
would recognize the key.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.930
Although, given the circumstances of his death,

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.770
the encryption could have been hastily created

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.270
to prevent the enemy from discerning his message.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.000
So we can't say for certain.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.270
Consider who he may have intended that message for,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.830
and ask that person. And perhaps you'll find some clues.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.570
Which means...

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.900
Lady Hokage or Kakashi Sensei...

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.500
Thank you very much.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.500
If I learn anything new, I'll come again.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.000
Sure, but I'll be home in bed, so just come by the house, ok?

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.200
Well... I'm heading home to sleep.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.670
What about you, Shiho?

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.230
Someone's gotta stay behind.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.570
9...31...8...106...7...207...15...

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.800
Can you think of anything?

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.370
Maybe in a conversation with Lord Jiraiya?

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.400
Something about these numbers...?

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.470
This number 106 is...

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.370
Lord Jiraiya?

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.200
It's 106.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.270
What is?

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.070
106 centimeters.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.300
No... That's not it.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.730
I can't think of anything.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.800
Why don't you try Lady Hokage or Naruto next?

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.130
I already asked Lady Hokage.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.270
Which leaves Naruto...

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.370
The secret code is a concern.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.570
But I'm also worried about Naruto. Try to cheer him up.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.830
Don't get your hopes up too high.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.500
Shoot... He's out.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.900
Shikamaru... What do you want?

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.970
For starters... Can I come in?

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.270
Well? Can you think of anything?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.430
Hey Naruto, I said can you think of anything?

00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.900
Naruto!

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.770
Oh sorry. What was it again?

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.270
Come with me.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.200
Where?

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.570
Just come.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.130
Wh-What is it?!

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.100
LEAF HOSPITAL

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.900
Why'd you bring me here?

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.630
Just wait.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.200
Ah! Here she comes.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.670
Huh?! Kurenai Sensei...

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.730
Yeah...

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.630
Were you hospitalized for eating too much barbeque?!

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.200
Your stomach's bigger than Choji's!

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.800
She's pregnant, not fat!

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.930
Cripes, you're still as obnoxious as ever.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.800
Huh?!

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.900
You mean...she's...?

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.200
Shikamaru, stop coming here so often.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.600
Sorry, no can do. Asuma asked me to do so.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.370
Shikamaru... What did Asuma ask you to do?

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.700
That child will be my student.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.930
Huh?

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.130
Asuma entrusted that child to me.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.100
I heard about Lord Jiraiya.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.900
I lost my teacher,

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.530
so it's not like I don't understand what you're going through.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.800
But whining and sulking isn't going to make things better.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.700
We're way past that point in our lives.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.300
What do you mean?

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.830
My teacher entrusted me with many things.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.300
Some important, some petty. All sorts of things.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.730
You too, right?

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.170
In fact, you must have a ton of stuff.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.600
So don't you think it's about time for us to step up?

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.700
Time for what?

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.930
Time for us to become the ones who entrust.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.170
It's a pain, but we can't keep complaining.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.770
You will eventually be the one treating to ramen,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.030
and you'll be called Naruto Sensei, or something.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.070
We can't stay brats forever...

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:37.530
If we wanna become super cool ninja like Asuma and Lord Jiraiya, that is.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.830
You're right.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.430
Thanks, Shikamaru.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.330
Pull yourself together.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.130
You got work to do.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.930
Right!

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.030
Comrades move on to decode the message left behind.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.030
Entrusted to Naruto from Jiraiya, what is the key to the encryption?

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.200
Shikamaru's brain and Shiho's experience leads them

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.070
to a certain answer.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.870
Finally, the hidden mystery is revealed!

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:59.530
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Decryption"

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.700
What is Jiraiya's message?

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:08.800
Tune in again!
