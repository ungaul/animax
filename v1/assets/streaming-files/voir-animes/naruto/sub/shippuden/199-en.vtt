WEBVTT

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.930
This landscape brings back memories…

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.510
The Tsuchikage and Kazekage are especially persistent.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.430
What should we do?

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.550
It's them!

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.180
At four o'clock!

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.630
Wood Style: Deep Forest Emergence!

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.510
He can do Wood Style?!

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.260
I guess this is it for us…

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.470
Damn it! I don't have much chakra left!

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.590
What should I do?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.720
Naruto, this time I'll lend you my power.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
Are you gonna say you want me to surrender my body over to you again?!

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.050
No…

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.090
I'll just give you my chakra.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.970
I don't care for Madara…

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.680
If I'm gonna be controlled, I'd rather it be you than him!

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.800
If I can keep using Madara like this,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.720
I'll be able to control the tide of this battle.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.300
I didn't expect him to become a card this strong.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.760
Naruto!

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.510
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.430
Giant Rasengan!

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.470
Do it…Naruto!

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.510
Giant Rasengan Barrage Line!

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.510
As you mentioned, he's quite a guy.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.470
Right?

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.880
I used up the chakra Nine Tails gave me all at once!

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.300
I'm at my limit!

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.930
I'm going to disappear at any moment!

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.550
Naruto… Enough.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.630
I'll take over from here.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.470
Lord Tsuchikage, you're in the same…

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.880
I finally have a chance at reclaiming myself!

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.300
And I've got myself a worthy opponent!

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.330
The Five Kage Assemble

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.120
I'll fight him!

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.660
That's crazy!

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.370
You're in no shape to do it!

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.370
I'd like to try out some more jutsu…

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.910
But I don't think you can dance anymore, Ohnoki.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.660
What's that look?

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.530
Long ago, I showed you the difference in our strength.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.780
Why?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.160
That wasn't the agreement!

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.660
Lord Hashirama is…

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.450
There is no alliance…

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.530
Just submit to the power of the Hidden Leaf!

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.530
And…never mention the name of that shinobi in front of me!

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.370
We shinobi are weary of all this endless fighting.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.240
We've kept on fighting for the sake of our nations and villages.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.950
Without a care about other nations and villages, we just take!

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.080
We take away, then they take away in an endless cycle…!

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.280
Hatred has caused three wars!

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.780
That is life.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.240
I can't believe you've lived this long

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.910
and not learned a thing from the pain of the past.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.200
I've lived longer than you!

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.080
I've learned twice as much!

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.580
It's because I've experienced pain in the past

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.910
that I can even consider what would be best for the future!

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
Yet this is the fourth war!

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.530
Is this what's best?

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.450
This war is different!

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.700
Unlike the past wars where we took from each other…

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.530
this time, we are fighting together in order to achieve something different!

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.700
By watching them,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.200
I've learned that time does not simply pass by!

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.530
Though slow in pace, the world is accruing its past experiences…

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.160
and heading towards "peace."

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.780
There's no need for the world to mature any further.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.080
It can slumber in the genjutsu of the Eternal Tsukuyomi!

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.740
Long ago, you made me forsake myself.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.240
That's why…

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.200
I will defeat you here… and reclaim myself!

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.030
The one who will slumber shall be you!

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.080
Lord Tsuchikage!

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.330
Come… I will help you reclaim yourself.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.240
The elderly always complain when young ones try to help…

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.200
I'll let you all meddle this time!

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.370
It seems they can still dance.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.490
For myself! For the future!

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.870
I will bring you down!

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.370
Damn it!

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.580
Lady Tsunade!

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.240
You said your name was Mabui?

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.660
Prepare to do your Ethereal Transmission Jutsu!

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.450
Come with me!

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.330
Ethereal Transmission is a jutsu used to transport items!

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.080
Unlike the Summoning or Reverse Summoning Jutsu,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.580
it's impossible to transport people!

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.160
There's no time to argue! Unless we try, we'll never know!

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.330
I do know!

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.240
The transmission rate is so fast, the body cannot keep up and will be torn apart.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.870
Death is certain!

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.870
The only one who survived Ethereal Transmission in the past

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.910
is the Third Raikage!

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.280
But that was only because of his superhuman body.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.160
Now I can understand the Fourth Raikage since he is of the Third's blood…

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.240
But Lady Hokage, it's impossible for you!

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.870
Please reconsider this!

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.450
I have an idea…

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.870
The Flying Raijin Jutsu.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.200
We'll summon Genma's squad here.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.740
Then if we mark one of Katsuyu's clones,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.490
and transmit her to the site first…

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.120
I have the ability to survive being split into pieces…

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.990
That's not necessary!

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.080
I will use this.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.280
So that's it.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.530
But it's a risky gamble. And you tend to be unlucky with bets…

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.620
GAMBLE That's only when I bet money.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.580
It's different when I bet my life. That's why I'm still alive.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.330
Lord Raikage!

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.660
Please tell Lady Hokage to think it over…

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.580
Mabui, prepare the Ethereal Transmission…

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.330
For two.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.080
Not you too, Lord Raikage!

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.530
Shikaku!

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.830
We have no other options left.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.490
It's time for the Supreme Commander to make his appearance!

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.370
However, Madara belongs to the Uchiha Clan…

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.410
If we don't do something about the Fire Style,

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.450
we won't have a chance at winning.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.410
We'll use the Flying Raijin Jutsu… against him.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.280
Damn!

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.910
The more I cut down, the more confidence I gain.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.870
That's why I just have to keep slicing!

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.280
Right!
Yeah!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.830
I thought that was a lot of chakra he was gathering…

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.410
But I had no idea the sword would be this huge…

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.950
I-I can't move…

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.030
I can't believe that you changed that sword so quickly.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.910
He's pretty good!

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.990
Genma!

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.530
Sorry, but could you please just do as I say?

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.830
Is that you, Shikaku?

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.280
It's urgent. Do exactly as I say, no interruptions!

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.370
First off, the real Madara has been reanimated.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.160
Sorry, but can I interrupt?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.950
I said no!

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:31.950
Do it!

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.120
H-Here I go…

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.410
Ethereal Transmission Jutsu!

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.490
I'm surprised…

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.700
Instantaneous travel through dimensions…

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.330
Isn't that the Fourth Hokage's jutsu?

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:57.200
We used to belong to a squad assigned to protect the Fourth Hokage.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.280
Now, it's the Fifth Hokage, but…

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.660
The Flying Raijin Jutsu was taught to us by the Fourth.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.780
But unlike the Fourth, it takes the three of us for it to work.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.240
We apologize for the tight fit.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.240
Lady Mizukage…

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.910
Please bring Madara down!

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.740
As one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.410
I will protect this place with my life!

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.950
Chojuro…

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.280
He's matured so much since leaving the village.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.870
Please get ready!

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.240
Lady Tsunade bears the Jutsu Formula on her.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.780
The instant she arrives on the battlefield,

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.240
we will make the jump!

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.240
Understood!

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.370
I'm already late getting to the altar. I won't be late for anything else.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.530
Unruly Ay and…Princess Tsunade!

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.280
I've relayed our coordinates to HQ!

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.330
Reserve Seal! Release!

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.450
Ninja Art of Mitotic Regeneration!

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.280
Are you all right?!

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.240
Yeah…

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.370
Granny Tsunade?!

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.830
That's her regenerating jutsu!

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.410
Since everyone is alive, I guess we weren't late.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.490
Finally, I'll get to see some action… I've been bored stiff!

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.280
All right, I'm ready!

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.200
Living long was well worth it.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.620
Imagine… Being able to see the day

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.410
when the Five Kage would be united and fight side by side.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.270
This is perfect.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.980
This will make my test worthwhile.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.230
Thank you, Princess Tsunade.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.600
I'll heal the two of you.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.350
Raikage, Mizukage! Buy me some time!

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.310
Here we go, Mizukage!

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.100
Right!

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.180
Lava Style: Lava Monster Jutsu!

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.560
Jutsu this pitiful isn't even worth absorbing!

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:27.810
He's fast!

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.180
Lateral Bolt of Pain! Chop!

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.100
I feel so out of place here…

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.560
He's probably not dead yet, huh?

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.980
He's capable of this much destruction… Stay alert!

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.350
There's no way for us to jump in.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.230
You guys come with me… I'm going after the other one.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.480
Help me!

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.020
Is that him?

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.520
Follow me! Let's go!

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.680
How much longer, Hokage?!

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.310
Almost done!

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.680
Are you okay, Granny Tsunade?

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.980
Whenever you use that forehead mark jutsu,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.930
you get old and fall down!

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.270
This is different from the time with Pain.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.060
I only healed myself…

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.180
And besides, it wasn't much of an injury.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.600
I have more than enough chakra!

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.230
Then heal me too!

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.480
I may be a clone, but I can't afford to disappear yet!

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.140
I'll join you and… That's not necessary.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.060
Why…?!

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:10.640
This is no longer just a war to protect you.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.100
Lightning Style teleportation and Lava Style Kekkei Genkai…

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.100
Impressive attacks…

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.430
I usually like men who are hard to melt…

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.980
But you, I want to avoid.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.270
He counters me even with my speed.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:03.390
More speed… I need to increase my power to crush his defense!

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.270
What about your defense?

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.180
A Stone Golem and a Sand Shield…

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.640
This war is now a battle to protect each other!

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.270
Then, I wanna fight Madara too!

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.270
A two-fold defensive wall of Sand and Stone, huh?

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.430
Also, quite impressive!

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.560
Here he comes!

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.310
Time to go on the offensive!

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.770
Mizukage! Raikage! Listen to me now!

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.020
Why you…! Hold it!

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.140
How pesky!

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.390
All right. Understood!

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.770
Mizukage!

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.480
Water Style: Hidden Mist Jutsu!

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.100
Hidden Mist…

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.890
They're trying to weaken the Rinnegan's field of vision with it.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.890
Let's do this, Raikage!

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.890
Right!

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.810
That Tsuchikage…

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.020
He lightened the Raikage to increase his speed…

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.850
However…

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.310
Your punch is light.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.310
It's just like the last time. No need to worry…

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.850
Super Weighted Boulder Jutsu!

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.270
Granny, fix me up now!

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.770
Listen to me, Naruto…

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.390
You see… This war we're fighting…

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.350
In the beginning, I only agreed to join the Allied Forces

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.310
to get rid of the Akatsuki.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.520
But as I fought alongside you all,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.230
I started feeling differently.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.140
So now, I want to be here

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.310
as the Tsuchikage of the Allied Shinobi Forces!

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.890
In the same manner,

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:07.230
shinobi villages that were once at odds have joined together,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.770
are changing and becoming one!

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.270
So maybe, this system of the shinobi world

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.230
which has bred so much hatred can change!

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.770
Naruto… Let us deal withthis Madara!

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.140
I swear we shall settle this once and for all!

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.770
It will be our first step

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.270
in stopping the curse of hatred we've been under until now!

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.350
Like Madara, we are similarly guilty of stirring up hatred in the past.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.770
It is our responsibility to make things right!

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.980
Rest assured and leave this to us!

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:40.930
So…

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.180
You go take care of the other Madara!

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:48.140
That will become the first step in promoting hope for the future.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.890
Old one, new one…

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.930
Defeating both Madaras will bring an end to this war!

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.230
We will protect you on this battlefield!

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.310
So protect us by fighting over there!

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.180
Clone Naruto… I entrust you with this message from the Five Kage.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.480
We will win!

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.430
Yeah!

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.100
We'll win!

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.180
Damn, it's so hard… I couldn't even put a crack in it.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.100
Chill out, Naruto… Fool, ya fool.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.180
I could've let him pass through me…

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.230
But he couldn't even damage this mask…

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:53.310
I hope that's not all the power you can muster to control the Nine Tails.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:59.310
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Unbreakable Mask and the Shattered Bubble"

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.100
This jutsu… This chakra is…?

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.930
THE UNBREAKABLE MASK AND THE SHATTERED BUBBLE

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.180
Tune in again!
