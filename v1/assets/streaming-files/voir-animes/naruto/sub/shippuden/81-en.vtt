WEBVTT

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.700
Can I ask you something?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.030
What is it?

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.030
Why are you gathering men?

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.800
I have a goal...

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.170
And I have a better chance of achieving it with a small platoon.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.730
Ever since I approached Orochimaru, this moment is all I've thought about,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.500
and I've been pre-selecting highly skilled Ninja.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.200
Oh...?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.430
So...why would you choose Karin?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.470
Unlike me, she's a follower of Orochimaru...

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.770
The warden of the southern hideout

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.330
where Orochimaru kept his test subjects locked up.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.270
After claiming to be under Orochimaru's orders,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.030
she tinkered with my body countless times.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
Besides, her personality turns me off.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.670
Granted, there were other strong Ninja I could have swayed.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.930
But she has a special power no one else possesses.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.100
Well... I'll admit that.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.430
A nice smell...and a bad odor.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.830
There's hardly any security in this hideout.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.970
They should at least build a fence.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.670
She has this place under control. There's no need.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.130
Still, it's too quiet.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.900
You'd think that word of Orochimaru's death

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.770
had already reached this place...

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.700
You have one too.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.400
That one is more suitable.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.900
Open sesame!

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.730
Say, I've been thinking.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.400
That rumor must be true-- Shut up!

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.170
You know what happened to the others who brought that up...

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.900
Yeah...

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.230
you're right...

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.230
Oh, damn it...

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.730
That's Sasuke Uchiha!

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.730
What's he doing in a place like this?

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.270
It's been quite a while since he came here with Orochimaru.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.430
Yeah, why didn't he come with Orochimaru?

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.570
He's with a guy we've never seen before...

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.900
Maybe that rumor is true...! About Orochimaru being dead.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.400
That's it! Sasuke must've killed Orochimaru!

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.530
And he's come to free us all!

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.900
Idiot. Like that'll ever happen!

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.670
Besides, Orochimaru would never get killed.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.330
So it's you, after all...Sasuke.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.400
Guardian of the Iron Wall

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.370
Sasuke...

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.700
The fact that you're here alone must mean that the rumors were true.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.600
Geez, that's mean. I'm here too.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.400
And? What brings you here?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.830
Sasuke has something to discuss with you.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.030
We can't stand out here and talk, so take us inside, will you?

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.400
It's been so long since I've walked... I'm exhausted.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.670
What do you want to talk about?

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.100
I said let's not stand out here, Karin.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.670
Although I know you're totally ignoring me.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:08.800
Humph!

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.070
You disgust me.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.670
What'd you say?

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.070
Cut it out, Karin. Take us inside.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.300
Fine.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.870
Karin, follow me. I need you.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.370
Huh?! Why would I follow you? I'm under orders to oversee this place!

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.770
Orochimaru is already gone.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.430
What about the prisoners here?

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.400
Speaking of prisoners, they were awfully quiet.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.000
Have the rumors about Orochimaru's death reached them?

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.270
The number of prisoners has slightly lessened since I came here last.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:08.170
Also, there are signs of recent digging in the grounds in front of the entrance.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.700
Karin, with that sharp intellect, information control must be your forte.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.570
I get it.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.100
Rumors about Orochimaru's death began spreading among the prisoners,

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.270
so in order to avoid a riot, Karin has been wisely taking action...

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.730
Is that it?

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.600
Hey, do you know about that rumor?

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.770
Yeah, I know. About Orochimaru being killed, right?

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.630
Yeah.

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.300
You planted a spy among the inmates

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.730
and if anyone began gossiping about Orochimaru...

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.500
Karin, it's your cautious nature which maintained order in the prison.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.600
Or rather...kept you alive.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.830
You'd better stop talking like that!

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.900
You've been trained by Orochimaru, all right. Man, you're scary.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.130
You probably sensed our presence long ago.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.430
You could've even killed us by now.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.900
If you were alone.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.870
But not Sasuke?

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:36.000
I didn't say that! Sasuke is a colleague.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.930
I wanted to see if the rumors were true...

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.800
that Sasuke killed Orochimaru.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:43.900
I did kill him.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.070
How can you say that so casually?!

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.700
Suigetsu... Release everyone who is held prisoner here.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.770
Wha--?!

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.970
Geez... You always order people around.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.030
You can't just come here and take over!

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.770
You don't know what it took to keep things in order here...

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.470
Without prisoners, there won't be any need for a warden.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.970
I'll say it once more. Come with me, Karin.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.370
What'll you do?

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.370
Well, anyway, I'll go and release the prisoners.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.370
I refuse! Besides...

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.400
I'm under no obligation to follow you!

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.500
Too bad...

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.000
Since you seem dead set against it, I'll just ask someone else.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.830
I knew it!

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.970
The rumors that Sasuke Uchiha brought down Orochimaru were true!

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.800
Yeah, it's true.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.300
What'll happen to those of us in here?

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.630
Of course, you're free to go.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.030
A-Are you sure?!

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:30.170
Yeah... I was once imprisoned too. But as you can see, I'm free.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:40.730
I'm going to unlock the cells. Before that, I have one favor to ask.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.200
What is it?! Ask us anything!

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.100
Well...

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:50.700
The one who defeated Orochimaru and gave us our freedom is Sasuke.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.670
When you're out, spread the word to everyone...

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:59.170
A man has appeared who will bring peace and tranquility to this world.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.300
I'm coming.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.630
Since you're so adamant...

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.270
I'll go with you.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.370
What's this? That was a quick change of heart.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.070
After thinking it over,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.330
I realized I'm tired of guarding this place.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.100
It's locked from the inside...

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.570
That woman!

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.230
That's Suigetsu.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.970
Let's forget about that nuisance, okay, Sasuke?

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.830
You... Don't get so close.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.770
Look...what's wrong with just you and me?

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.170
We don't need a guy like...Suigetsu.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.570
Your cunning and sense of caution...

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.230
and especially your power to sense Chakra...

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:35.530
From the moment I met you, I knew I could use you.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.300
Yes...that time...

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:56.070
Lord Orochimaru sent me here. To assist you, Sasuke Uchiha.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.370
Two hours ago, 118 test subjects escaped from the hideout.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.770
Judging from the time, they are all still in this forest.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.800
I understand that this order is to capture them dead or alive.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.170
Yeah.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.000
Well then, let's begin.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.600
50, 60...

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:32.670
70...80...90...100!

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.870
Found them!

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.130
I'll start with the ones hiding closest to us.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.530
There's one fifty meters behind us.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.500
And four more in front of us at ten o'clock.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.170
So fast!

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.430
Can you keep up?

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.170
It's my duty.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.670
Karin, become my eyes.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.200
D-Don't give me orders!

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.430
Three are hiding over at 1:30.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.100
And from that point, at nine o'clock,

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.770
there are five more waiting to ambush us.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.270
How many?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.900
This one makes 84.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.100
Sasuke, why don't you kill them?

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.100
You're so lenient.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.530
There's only one man I have a desire to kill.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.000
Wh-What...?!

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.600
This guy's...Chakra...!

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.970
This guy...is cool!

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.070
Karin!

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.100
Karin!

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.400
You did that...for me?

00:16:54.100 --> 00:17:00.100
If I were to lose you, capturing the escapees would become difficult.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.370
I know!

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.870
At that moment...

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:18.530
I... Sasuke... Sasuke, I...

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.130
Hope my blade isn't chipped...

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.970
Let's go, Sasuke. Karin turned you down, didn't she?

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.200
No. It seems she's coming.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.630
Wh-Who said I'm coming?!

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:45.170
I just... I just happened to be going in the same direction.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.970
That's all, nothing else...!

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.430
Oh, how nice. Then we can travel together partway.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.070
Yeah, just part of the way!

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.570
All right... Next is Jugo.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.470
What? You're going to see Jugo?

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.530
That shouldn't concern you

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.470
since you're just coming with us part of the way.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.230
Sure, I could care less, but what's wrong with asking?

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.500
Wanna make something of it, you jerk?!

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:16.930
Let's go!

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.870
Y-Yeah...

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.870
I'll go!

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.670
Sasuke Uchiha...

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.570
He always looks so calm and cool...

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.730
This feeling...is exciting.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.900
Of the hundreds, the thousands I've encountered,

00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:00.170
his Chakra is the best... It grabs you!

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.230
Compared with that...

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.670
What?!

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.570
Your Chakra...bothers me.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.770
Huh?

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.230
I could say the same about yours.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.300
No, a woman...

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.100
A woman is nice... No, wait.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.670
A guy? I guess a guy is better...

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.730
No... A woman...?

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.530
A woman... No...

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.400
Maybe a guy...

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.130
We have to keep walking? I'm exhausted.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.600
We're about to go to the northern hideout.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.470
If you're acting like that, you'll be killed the moment you arrive there.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.170
I didn't realize the place is so dangerous.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.930
Yeah, the northern hideout is no ordinary hideout.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.470
What do you mean by that?

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.900
The place is a human experiment facility.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:01.130
Intolerably bad monsters were created there and kept under restraint.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.330
Next time: "Jugo of the Northern Hideout"

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.830
Naruto Uzumaki's Swirling Radio! Our guest today is...

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.100
Hello, I'm Kakashi Hatake.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.100
Getting right to the point,

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.330
can you stop ad-libbing during rehearsals?

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:24.470
What? I'm just trying to keep everyone calm.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.500
Well, you sure seem to enjoy it.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.230
Th-That's just an act!

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.200
Oh yeah?

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.730
Well, whatever.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.870
Here's a postcard from "Super Beast Scroll."

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.000
"I've been thinking about a nickname for Kakashi Sensei."

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.430
"How about Pervy Hedgehog?"

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.430
There goes my dignity...

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.870
And moving on to "Sparkling Maiden."

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.870
"I'll get right to the point! Aren't you going to get married?"

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.670
"Also, your habit of always being late when your team assembles.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.770
"That's very rude."

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
"Finally, please don't read your smut books in front of us.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.830
"To put it bluntly, that's sexual harassment."

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.470
- Kakashi Sensei?! What's wrong? - Man...

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.600
Kakashi Sensei! Will you come back again?

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.600
I'll never come again!!

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.600
Tune in again!
