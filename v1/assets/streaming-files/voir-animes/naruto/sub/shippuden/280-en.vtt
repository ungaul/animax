WEBVTT

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.930
This is bad…

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.930
He's merging all the chakra that's been scattered into one…

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.840
And doing it unbelievably well too, almost unrivaled.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.260
He's just as good as Old Man Six Paths…

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.340
Well, except he's doing the reverse thing…

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340
There's no Gedo Statue here,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.550
so he's making the Susano'o the receiving vessel.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.840
Something incredible is going to emerge…

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.760
Don't let down your guard, Naruto!

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.260
That jutsu again?

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.090
Naruto…

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.010
That jutsu of yours symbolizes your weakness.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.260
That's right… It's a jutsu that covers up

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.590
your loneliness!

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.010
Why that—!

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.470
You only hold a little piece of each Tailed Beast's chakra…

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.760
You can't win against me now.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.010
Nor this…

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.590
Not yet?!

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:06.930
Kurama!

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.090
I might have amassed too much, in fact.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.340
It's everything that's available.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.680
Here it comes!

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.050
Here it comes!

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.140
I can feel it!

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.010
How did he gain so much Nature Energy so suddenly?

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.430
Let's do this!

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.970
Yeah!

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.050
You finally decided to kill me, huh?

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.140
We've taken on a lot of responsibilities upon our shoulders…

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.680
But you see,

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.640
I…

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.180
I want to fight you too.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.840
I wanna fight, and win against you fair and square!

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.340
But… …not against the current you!

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.010
You already know that too… right, Sasuke?!

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.390
This fight with you right now, will be my last.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.890
Indra's Arrow…

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.930
Currently the most powerful jutsu in my arsenal…

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.390
So just…die.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.050
Just be gone already!

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.840
Damn it…

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.260
You're not—!

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.430
Naruto!

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.840
If my Nature Energy didn't make it to you in time,

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.800
you'd have been blown away just now!

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.720
And your chakra's already long been drained from—

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.930
Amaterasu!

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.300
Only a diversion, huh?

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.970
I can't actually take him down with this…

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.640
I need the Tailed Beasts…

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.720
I've used too much chakra… can't maintain control!

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.140
At this rate, I can't use my left eye's abilities either!

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.010
He's still not—!

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.180
Give it up already…

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.140
– Sasuke! – Naruto!

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.590
Damn it!

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.890
Sasuke wins!

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.390
All right, both of you, make the Unison Sign.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.390
Not even a nod of acknowledgment?!

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.430
You jerk!

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.970
I've got to get this off my chest!

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.800
You turd! No, you hard, drippy turd!

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.800
Ouch!

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.430
I told you that shinobi Kumite is a time-honored and sacred tradition!

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.300
Now, make the Unison Sign now!

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:25.970
You're finally awake.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.300
It's dusk already.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.970
Where are Sasuke and Naruto?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.510
They're currently fighting their final battle…

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.340
…in order to settle things for good.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.300
Hang in there!

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.260
It's not much but I've finished infusing some more chakra—!

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.510
This is one of the abilities of the Rinnegan.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:20.340
As someone who possesses the eyes of the Uchiha…

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.010
My victory is inevitable.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.390
Now…

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.550
Now, I can finally be alone!

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:39.930
Farewell…

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.300
My one and only… friend!

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.640
That was a great counter!

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.930
You didn't miss the fact that his Visual Prowess is weakened!

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.300
Over and…

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.050
…over and…

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.340
…over and…

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.720
…over and…

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:43.390
…over and… …over and over and and over over again!

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:50.010
Just give up and let me cut you down!

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.010
Can't do that.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.220
'Cuz I'm your one and only friend!

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.760
I figured as much…

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.300
He's assimilated the chakra I created and infused for you,

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.720
and made it his own…

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.340
And now Flame Control…

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.010
He intends to finish this with one last blast.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.340
Listen, I'm giving what remains of my own chakra…

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.430
Once I do that, it's gonna put me to sleep.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.800
Don't unleash your jutsu until the last minute,

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.470
so he doesn't absorb more chakra from you.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.760
Well, not that he can use his newly awakened Rinnegan

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.220
to absorb chakra while putting out his own jutsu…

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:29.180
Who are you to be so confident when you couldn't even save Sasuke?

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.010
I've never given up… Once you give up, it's over.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.050
I will save Sasuke, and…

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:42.340
I'm coming after all that hate inside you too, someday!

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:50.590
Now go… You're the one and only for us too…

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.300
That's why Sasuke is…

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.820
NARUTO AND SASUKE

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.610
Am I dead?

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.650
This sensation… it must be…probably.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.860
Sorry, Grandma Tsunade.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.520
I promised I wouldn't die…

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.940
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Unison Sign"

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.400
…until I became the Hokage.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:28.610
Tune in again!
