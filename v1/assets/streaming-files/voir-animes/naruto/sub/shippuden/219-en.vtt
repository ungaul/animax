WEBVTT

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.550
Go… Naruto.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.130
You won't fail!

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.930
Yeah!

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.430
That power again, huh?

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.970
Kakashi, we ought to—!

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.630
That man, he couldn't be…

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.380
No… – Kakashi… – There's absolutely no way!

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.470
Kakashi!

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.380
Are you listening?

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.590
The more diversions, the better when attacking him!

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.380
We have to join the fight!

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.220
I've got a pretty good idea of what you're thinking right now.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.590
I feel the same way…

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.760
But leave it be.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.300
There's no time to wallow in sentimentality.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.340
Your former subordinate, Naruto, has already jumped into action!

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.430
How stupid, jumping in alone!

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.550
Yo! Yo!

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.930
Damn it!

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.590
I'm not alone!

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.720
Don't forget Kurama!

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.930
There's also Octopops and Eight-o… Bushier Brow Sensei!

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.550
And Kakashi Sensei too!

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.430
You've got a winning record against me right now…

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.130
This better not be enough to slow you down… Kakashi!

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.010
Naruto… I'm glad you were my subordinate!

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.260
Let's go…Guy!

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.720
My dear rival!

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.510
That's what I'm talking about!

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.590
Considering my remaining chakra…

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470
I only have a few shots left.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.880
I do not fear a borrowed power

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.510
that can't even string together a barrage.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.340
The true power of Kamui… This Kamui… I will not miss…

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.630
– Now watch and learn! – my timing!

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.590
Their knowing the trick to my jutsu changes nothing.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.050
If he has to materialize when he takes things in,

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.760
he has to do so when he spits things out too!

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.550
This is our chance!

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.760
That's if you can counterstrike!

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.510
What is this?

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.930
Naruto!

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.840
These have Curse Marks on them that restrain Tailed Beast power.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.380
Whatever you do, don't touch it!

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.340
Octopops!

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.340
Could you shield me for a bit?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.340
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.550
All right, come here! I'll be your umbrella!

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.340
Kamui!

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.430
If it's that same trick again,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.050
all I need to do is not have Naruto slip through me.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.300
What? A Shadow Clone?

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.760
Kakashi!

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.470
Seems my attack was quicker than you, Kakashi.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.300
You missed transporting away the Rasengan…

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.720
…and wasted another Kamui.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.220
Not yet!

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.930
Tailed Beast Bomb!

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.300
A bit late. How futile.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.840
You're—!

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.300
Naruto Uzumaki!

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.680
I see, so that Kamui just now wasn't transporting the Rasengan,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.220
but the Shadow Clone itself!

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
He beat me to it… Damn you, Kakashi!

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.760
Who…

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.760
Damn it!

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.930
…are you?!

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.300
Who Are You?

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.260

PLAN BY KAKASHI'S CLASSMATES TO OBTAIN GIFTS TO CELEBRATE HIS PROMOTION TO JONIN. TOP SECRET MISSION.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.180
As of today, Kakashi is a jonin just like me.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.340
Remember, we were talking about this just the other day, Obito?

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.010
When we discussed getting Kakashi a gift!

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.130
Sorry. I guess I wasn't listening.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.260
Well, I got you this. A custom-made kunai.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.300
It's a little heavy and unconventional.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.130
But you'll get used to it quickly.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.300
Thank you.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.800
I got you this!

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.970
Here! A personalized med kit for you.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.050
I just adjusted a few things to make it easier to use.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.300
Thank you.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.340
What are you holding your hand out for?

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.930
Kakashi's father, Sakumo, took his own life

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.050
after everyone around him vilified him.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.260
This is where we go our separate ways.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.470
Let's get going… Captain.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.800
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.300
We'll be taking this one with us.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.930
Do you have any idea what you're saying, Kakashi?!

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:09.880
Yeah…

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.050
The two of us have to complete the mission alone.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.550
And Rin? What do we do about Rin, huh?

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.430
We'll come back for her later.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.470
We must carry out our mission even at the expense of our comrades.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.510
You're right. In the Ninja World,

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.470
those who break the rules and laws are regarded as scum.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.470
But…

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.840
those who would abandon even one of their friends,

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.430
are far worse than scum.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.090
Found them!

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.880
Kakashi? Why did you—?

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.840
Well, I certainly can't leave this up to a crybaby ninja like you, can I?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.970
Kakashi…

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.090
Obito, behind you!

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.010
My eye…!

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.430
Kakashi!

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.430
Hey, Kakashi! Are you all right?!

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.550
B-But how?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.970
There's no way that you could've seen me!

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.550
Obito… How did you…?!

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.380
Release!

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.510
Kakashi… Obito…

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680
This is bad!

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.090
Whatever the village or anyone else may say…

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.430
I think that you're a great jonin…

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.050
It's true, that's how I feel.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.510
Please accept this…

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.010
Is that you…Obito?

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.990
Are you really Obito?

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.660
I thought you died!

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.280
There's no mistake.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.120
That's Obito Uchiha…

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.780
You can call me by that name if you want.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.580
It means nothing to me.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:57.370
My eye!
Kakashi!

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.530
Obito… How did you…?!

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.280
This time, I will protect my comrade!

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.660
But that day, you…

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.030
Run for the exit!

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.950
Kakashi!

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.410
You guys all right? Rin? Kakashi?

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.240
Obito!

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.490
No, don't. It's okay, Kakashi.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.330
I don't think…I'll make it.

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:13.120
My right side is completely crushed.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.410
I can't even feel anything there anymore.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.870
So what if I'm captain now?!

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.830
So what if I made jonin?!

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.120
Oh, that's right, I totally forgot…

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.620
I was the only one…

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:40.830
who didn't give you a gift for making jonin, Kakashi.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:50.410
I'm giving you my Sharingan.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.280
Kakashi, take care of Rin…

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:05.870
I will.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:13.580
Obito!

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.200
Obito…

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.870
You're alive…

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:29.990
Who is he?

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.030
He was our classmate and an Uchiha who was a Leaf Shinobi.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.950
We all thought he was killed in action during the last war.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.870
If you survived, why didn't you come forward sooner?

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.620
It's irrelevant whether I had survived or not.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.370
Although, I suppose…

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.080
If you really want an answer…

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.330
It's because…

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.200
you let Rin…

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.120
die.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.450
Relax…

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.410
Besides, what's with that look, Kakashi?

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.410
You're not going to condemn me?

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.080
What would I gain from criticizing this absurd reality at this point?

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.160
I have no interest in the affairs

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.620
of a world that shall soon cease to exist.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:49.370
Kakashi Sensei!

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.660
I don't know what went down between you two,

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.910
but this is no time to be depressed!

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.410
We can discuss it later!

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.780
Right now, stopping what this guy is trying to do comes first!

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.780
Naruto!

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.530
Kakashi! Naruto is absolutely right!

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.830
The fate of this world currently rests in our hands!

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.240
I have nothing more to talk to you about.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.200
Stay tied down to reality… Fire Style… and die!

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.160
Bomb Blast Dance!

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.240
The Nine Tails' tail, huh?

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.450
Huh? What the—?!

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.240
Looks like you're having fun over here…

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.330
Obito.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.870
He's…Madara!

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.240
Madara? You mean that Madara?

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.200
Why? Why is that Madara over here?

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.280
Hey, Naruto! Him being here must mean…

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.410
What's happened to everyone over there?!

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.870
I'm not sure, but I suspect…

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.280
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Obito and Madara"

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.120
…that none of them are doing too well.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.580
OBITO AND MADARA

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:09.030
Tune in again!
