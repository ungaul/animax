00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.500
The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.770
There's no end to this awful rain...

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.670
Joking! I'm just joking!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.500
You know, I'm grateful to you.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.870
I'm sure Master Jiraiya is fine.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.670
He, of all people, wouldn't... He's not coming back...

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.530
Huh?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.130
That's what I bet him.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.170
And I never win my bets.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.200
Oh, I see.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.900
Rejection makes a man stronger.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.630
And besides... men aren't the ones who seek happiness.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.230
What a poser...

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.530
When he gets back...

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.700
I won't let him keep his cool.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.670
Pain... What are you?!

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.600
Pain...

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.830
That name is an alias that denotes all six of us.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.800
Y-You're...!

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.270
That face...

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.470
Is that you, Yahiko?

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.670
Oh yeah... There was such a guy, wasn't there?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.900
He died a long time ago.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.730
What's going on? I thought you said Yahiko died!

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.170
Plus, those eyes...

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.330
You see Yahiko's image in me?

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.470
You really are his former Teacher.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.530
But Yahiko has been dead for quite some time.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.400
All that remains...is Pain.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.400
Quit it with the wordplay!

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.730
Why do you possess the Rinnegan?!

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.070
What are you talking about, Jiraiya-boy?

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.600
One of my former students is among them.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.870
Except he didn't use to possess those eyes...

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.170
What in tarnation is going on?

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.300
You saying there are two children of prophecy?

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.200
No, that's not it either...

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.570
When I saw the Rinnegan, I convinced myself that the first one was Nagato...

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.970
But he's subtly different from the Nagato I knew of...

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.400
Come to think of it, upon closer inspection,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.870
none of those six remind me of Nagato.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.070
On the other hand, one of them resembles Yahiko...

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.030
but possesses Nagato's Rinnegan...

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.330
Are you Yahiko...or Nagato?

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.400
Just what exactly are you?!

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.330
We are Pain...

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.200
We are god.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.970
Retreat, Jiraiya-boy!

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.730
A god?!

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.370
Yahiko! How could you possess Nagato's eyes?!

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.300
Even if you knew that, you could not win!

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.530
Lad! Give up already!

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.470
I must find an opening to defeat them, even if it kills me!

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.530
I don't sense his presence...

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.270
This is...a barrier?

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.600
Gastric fluid?

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.570
Rasengan!

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.400
You did it, Jiraiya-boy.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.070
Is he dead?

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.200
I barely managed to kill one...

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.330
only after dragging it into my barrier...

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.000
Are you all right, lad?

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.170
Somewhat...

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.170
My body...?!

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.370
My chakra's agitated!

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.570
Is it this?!

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.700
Their identity is a mystery, and they seem to use odd weapons too.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.330
They're no longer mortals... They're something entirely different.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.330
No one really knows what he looks like.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.200
And some claim that he doesn't even exist.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.530
That face... He is unmistakably Yahiko...

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.670
And yet, he possesses Nagato's Rinnegan...

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.730
Did Yahiko steal them from Nagato for some reason?

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.070
But...

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.530
There are other Rinnegan bearers as well...

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.830
So what's going on?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.170
Plus...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.700
Understanding such pain enables you to be kind to others...

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.600
That's what makes us human.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.930
What do you mean by that...?

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.800
It's called growing up.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.130
Growing up? What do you mean?

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.130
That, you need to figure out yourself.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:06.100
Too many people die here. That pain made me grow up.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.930
In which case, does that mean he is Nagato?

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.800
That's right! Now I remember!

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.530
This one is definitely not Nagato!

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.000
What's the matter?

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.230
This fellow before us...

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.470
I've fought him before.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.500
He was a Fuma Clan member I encountered

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:45.400
right after setting out on my journey, following the Great Lord Elder's prophecy.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.030
I gave him that scar on his forehead...

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.800
So what's a fellow like him doing here?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.630
Now I'm even more confused about this whole Pain mystery.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.500
You will guide that revolutionary.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.130
The day will come when you will be forced to make a critical selection.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.830
What must I do...?

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.730
In order to make the right choice?

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.700
In my dream, you traveled the world, writing books.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.100
It can't be... If this is the prophecy...

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:26.070
I wish to go back and face them in order to confirm something...

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.370
You two please go back.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.570
What?!

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.830
Absolutely not! You will be killed if you go out again!

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.530
They have more eyes,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.530
and they will not fall for the barrier trap twice!

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.900
They're not on to us in here yet.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.000
This is our only chance to make a run for it!

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.970
I may be killed if I go out there...

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.230
But I may be able to learn the truth about them.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.130
If I let this chance slip by,

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.100
I don't think there's anyone else who could get as close to Pain.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.130
This is our only chance to uncover the truth...

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.970
Plus...

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.770
This is the time for selection that the Great Lord Elder prophesied!

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.900
Boss and Ma'am...

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.600
please take the intel on Pain we've gathered so far,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.400
as well as this corpse and go back.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.730
And please tell Tsunade...

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.500
Ma should be enough for that.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.800
But... Just return by dinnertime.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.170
Yup... When we're done here, I'll bring Jiraiya-boy on over with me.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.630
Thank you...

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.000
It's just as I thought!

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.730
They're all ninjas that I've encountered before!

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.870
That's it!

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.870
I've figured out who Pain is!

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.300
My throat... Jiraiya-boy!

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.730
You were too late in figuring it out...

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.800
I must let Boss know...about Pain's true identity.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.570
Hang in there, Jiraiya-boy!

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.900
It's no good... My throat has been crushed.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.400
Damn it... At this rate...

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.470
It's useless... I'm passing out...

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.670
Am I...going to die?

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.170
Have I failed...?

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.300
It's not how you live,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.300
but how you die in the ninja world...

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.130
A ninja's life is not measured by how they lived

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.500
but rather what they managed to accomplish before their death.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.330
Looking back, my life has been nothing but failures...

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.130
Continually rejected by Tsunade...

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.030
Unable to stop my friend...

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.830
And unable to protect either my student or my mentor...

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.400
Compared to the great deeds of the Hokage,

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:24.030
my actions are trifling, insignificant things indeed.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.830
I wish I could have died like each of the Hokage.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.330
A tale is only good as its final turn of events, the plot twist.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.300
Failures must be seen as mere amusements!

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.570
They are trials, which hone your skills. I lived believing that...

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.800
And in return, I swore I would accomplish a deed so great

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.830
that it would obliterate all of my failures...

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.070
And I'd die a splendid ninja!

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.530
At least, that's how it was supposed to go...

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.830
But...with my plot twist...

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.970
My tale, ending like this...

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:08.070
The Great Lord Elder prophesied that I would guide that revolutionary.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.300
A person who will make a great choice

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:15.370
that will bring either stability or destruction to the ninja world.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.270
I thought I would defeat Pain, stop the Akatsuki,

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.400
and save the ninja world from destruction...

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.500
But in the end, I failed in that selection too.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.100
How pitiful...

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.600
that this will be the twist to "The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant."

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.630
What a worthless story...

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.030
No, I don't think so. This tale is wonderful!

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.570
Each chapter reads like one of your numerous legendary exploits.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.230
It's almost like an autobiography.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.670
The main character of this book...

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.070
I thought his determination to never give up was really cool...

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.930
He's a lot like you, Sensei.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.970
Y-You think so...?

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.170
So I was thinking.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:02.970
Huh?

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.570
I really hope my unborn child

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.700
can become a ninja just like this main character!

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.870
Which is why I'd like your permission to name my son after him.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.270
H-Hey! Are you sure?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.400
It's just a random name that I thought up while eating ramen.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.670
Naruto...

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.000
It's a wonderful name.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.000
Kushina...

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.330
Cripes... So that makes me his godfather?

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.130
Are you really sure about this?

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.430
You are my sensei!

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.670
And you are a great ninja who possesses the true talent of a ninja!

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.000
There's no other like you.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.400
Yes...

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.930
That's right...

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.900
I gave that child...

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.270
I'm gonna become the Hokage!

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.370
A Hokage that surpasses all previous Hokage!

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:11.070
I never go back on my word... That's my ninja way!

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.030
Naruto...

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.630
Now that I think about it, Naruto,

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.530
you are just like that novel's main character.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:27.630
You've inherited Minato and Kushina's wishes, their hopes...

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.730
And yet...I...

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.430
You are my sensei!

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.100
And you are a great ninja who possesses the true talent of a ninja!

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.470
There's no other like you.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.370
A ninja is one who endures, one who stands brave.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.600
Let me teach you one thing...

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.230
The most important attribute of a ninja

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.230
is not the number of jutsu he masters.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.430
The most important thing is...

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.870
the guts to never give up!

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:08.670
Never go back on your word and never give up...

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.800
Naruto, if that is your ninja way...

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:18.130
Then as your mentor... I have no business whining.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:24.400
For everyone knows that a student inherits his ninja way from his teacher!

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.700
Isn't that so, Naruto?!

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.330
He fought his way back by sheer will?!

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.700
Jiraiya-boy!

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.570
I was sure his heart had stopped.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.970
Got it!

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.300
Never give up...

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.900
That was the true choice I was supposed to make!

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.430
Quite obstinate, isn't he?

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.230
Let's finish him off.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.130
All right! Message received!

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.030
A dying message... He wrote it in code, eh?

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:23.200
Naruto... You are the child of prophecy, I'm sure of it now.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.530
I entrust you with the rest!

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.700
The frog...got away.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.800
"The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant"...

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.430
Now it'll end a bit better I hope.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.600
The final chapter will be...

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:04.670
"The Frog in the Well Drifts Into the Great Ocean."

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.930
Not bad... Not bad at all...

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.100
Now... It's about time I put down my pen...

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:22.770
Ah, that's right! What should I name the sequel?

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.130
Let's see...

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.470
"The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki."

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.170
Yes... That has a nice ring to it...

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.030
Itachi Uchiha... You haven't changed, have you?

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.030
But I'm no longer the same as before.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.100
You don't know anything about me...

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:49.700
Of the hatred I carry towards you...

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.570
And how it helped me become stronger...

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.130
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Banquet Invitation"

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.270
Don't miss it!
