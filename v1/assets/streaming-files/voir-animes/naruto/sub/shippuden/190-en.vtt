NINJA NETWORK NEWS Ninja Network News!

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.220
Good evening, I am Mabui of the Cloud.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.990
I'm Shikaku Nara.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.370
Today, we'll be bringing you the latest news

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.200
from various battlefronts via satellite.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.950
Before that, here are some highlights

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.950
from battles that continue to rage on the frontlines.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.200
On the desert front, the standoff continues

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.330
between Gaara's Fourth Company and the previous Kage.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.870
On the coastal front,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.240
Darui and his First Company sustained heavy losses

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.240
when the enemy summoned a giant humanoid.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.030
However, they succeeded in eliminating most of the enemy force.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.830
The Third Company under Kakashi are sealing away

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.330
the Ninja Swordsmen one after another.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.200
The company has been split up into smaller units

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.990
and expanded the area of fierce fighting,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.370
in order to take down remaining enemies.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.580
Mifune's Fifth Company have joined up with the Commando Unit.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.280
Deidara's escape was unexpected,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.200
but they were successful in recapturing him.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.910
Next up, we have news about White Zetsu.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.240
His jutsu with which he mimics not only appearances, but even chakra,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.830
has created chaos within the Allied Force…

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.780
However, thanks to the fine observations

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.200
of Sakura Haruno of the Medical Unit,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.200
our genius strategist, Shikaku, has been able

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.160
to draw up a counter strategy.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.080
I'm refining the strategy right now, so please be patient just a bit longer.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.780
At the front, Sakura has just begun a news conference

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.660
in order to get data out about White Zetsu.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410
I understand you received a love letter,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.280
but rejected it immediately. Is this true?

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.870
Err…N-No, that's…

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.410
That hasn't been the only declaration of love you've received, has it?

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.410
U-Um… Please…

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.080
You supposedly said that you're already in love…

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.620
– Who is this person?! – Please tell us!

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.700
That has nothing to do with this news conference!! Cha!

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.660
Whoa… The "Kosuke Kills" corner was scheduled in this time slot…

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.410
but we just received an update.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.950
According to this bulletin,

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.330
the key figures of the Fourth Great Ninja World War,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.910
Killer Bee the Eight Tails and Naruto the Nine Tails,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.160
have persuaded Lady Tsunade and Lord Raikage…

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.200
and at long last, they are heading towards the battlefield.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.200
I'm amazed that they were able to convince those two.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.330
Looks like we have a satellite link with the duo.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.240
Let's ask them if they're excited about joining the war effort.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.740
Naruto… Naruto?

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.870
Was the link broken?

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.700
Is the equipment malfunctioning?

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.410
I'm not sure…

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.280
Okay, it seems we're connected now.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.660
All right, let's try again. Naruto!

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.530
So do I talk into this as I'm running?

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.240
Stay put, so the camera can focus.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.330
And I'll plant a kiss on you like this.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.370
Hey! Get out of my way!

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.240
What are those two doing?!

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.950
We're still on the air…

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.740
Naruto Enters the Battle

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.490
If Kisame's intel is correct, Naruto now has the same ability,

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.280
just like Mito Uzumaki, the wife of the First Hokage,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.370
to sense the enemy.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.910
Naruto will have no choice.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.950
He'll have to battle with White Zetsu.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.080
It's all going according to plan…

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.200
Today, the Senju's Will of Fire shall be extinguished.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.700
The two Kage who block their path and refuse to let them go are…

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.990
Lord Raikage and Lady Tsunade.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.080
Demanding that they get out of the way,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.370
Naruto makes his approach.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.030
The indomitable Bee is quick to react and jumps in to assist.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.620
Shockingly, Lady Tsunade steps aside to let them pass,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.530
inciting Lord Raikage to roar his dissent.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.660
But the sun inside Naruto softens his heart…

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.330
The light of brotherly love and parental love burns so bright,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.490
it makes him squint.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.120
And so, he relents and lets them go.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.030
In an intense, touching moment between men…

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.330
Lady Tsunade and Lord Raikage let Naruto have his way.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.330
Oh sorry… Lady Tsunade isn't a man.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.580
This is momentous.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.950
To think that Lord Raikage could be persuaded…

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.910
I'm not that surprised.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.530
There's something about Naruto

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.330
that makes the impossible seem possible.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.410
But…this could be just what the enemy is hoping for.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.240
Consider White Zetsu's Transformation Jutsu.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.910
It's as though it's used specifically to lure Naruto out.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.490
It definitely could be a trap.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.240
However, we have no choice, but to leave this in Naruto's hands.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.490
No one is allowed near Lady Shizune's tent!

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.580
Anyone making a move will be considered an enemy!

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.200
So, just stay put!

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.910
Don't move! You must not move!

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.330
Sakura, take a look at this genetic sequence data!

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.870
It's finally done?!

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.580
It has changed and become even more like Captain Yamato's

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.280
than it was at the Five Kage Summit!

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.700
In other words,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.740
there's very little difference from the First Hokage's genetic data.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.410
So it was true.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.740
What are you saying?!

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.370
What's this about the white guy and the First Hokage?

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.870
Namely, this white guy is a clone of the First Hokage.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.870
Or rather, judging from how many there are,

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.280
the First Hokage's cells were cultivated and

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.530
using mobile plants as a medium, clones that can move were created.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.450
They are diluted in strength, but they still use the Wood Style.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.580
Huh?! I still don't get it…

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.830
I don't get it,

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.030
but I'm supposed to guard you against plants. Right?

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.160
Well then, how about using termites?

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.280
Looking at this data, I'm sure Captain Yamato

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.240
is being used to make these clones stronger.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.200
I'll notify HQ immediately!

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.910
I'm back!

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.240
I got word that those white beings are transforming,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.280
and are causing havoc on the battlefield.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.200
Perhaps it's too much of a coincidence,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.910
but letting Naruto go couldn't have been timed better.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.780
I agree.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.660
Sorry to interrupt,

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.080
but we just got a report from the Medical Team.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.830
It's data about those white beings.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.950
Give it to me!

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.660
Who would have thought that Madara and Orochimaru's fixation

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.410
on the First Hokage would create this?

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:40.490
Botanical Ninja created from Grandfather's body.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.740
This is proof that

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.780
Madara has possession of the First Hokage's cells!

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.530
He's cultivated them

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.030
and developed a way to replicate them.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.530
Including his own body.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.490
No wonder he's been able to live this long.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.370
Well? Do we have an idea of how to destroy him?

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.490
No… Just the opposite…

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.280
Now, we don't even know what will kill him.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.200
It seems Madara is really…immortal!

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.330
An immortal leader and his mobile plants…

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.240
Reanimation zombies…

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.660
Not a normal human among them.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.530
Notify Naruto and Bee immediately

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.450
about the White Beings' Transformation Technique!

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.030
Naruto, please listen carefully. You too, Lord Bee.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.120
I am transmitting this message directly into your minds.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160
Let me explain the enemy's battle jutsu and their objective.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.950
Pay close attention.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.950
That explains all the weird, fuzzy sensations I've been having.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.120
I guess I have no choice, but to step up.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120
Yeah!

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.780
But remember, I mentioned that Madara's Project Tsuki no Me

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.200
won't work without your Tailed Beasts…

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.990
That means you two are his targets.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.200
I know that!

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.660
As if I'd sit still and let them capture me!

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.200
Then this time,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.200
don't even think about negotiating with him, Naruto.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.240
Madara is different from Pain and Nagato.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.280
He has no interest in peace.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.370
He's a truly evil man who covets the entire world.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.660
Controlling people requires the skill to manipulate

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.830
the darkness in their souls.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.330
Although, Nagato just happened to be easily influenced.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.870
Don't compare yourself with Nagato!

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.200
His ways were different, but he truly wished for peace!

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.030
But you're different!

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:49.950
You're right.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:58.240
The appearance of an Uchiha… gathering Tailed Beasts…

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.160
Just what is your goal?

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.660
What do you hope to accomplish?

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:10.330
Let's see… If anything, it's to become complete.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.200
And with Project Tsuki no Me,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.910
he'll be able to completely control humans through genjutsu…

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.740
That's about it. So don't let down your guard!

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.780
I once talked to Madara in the Land of Iron.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.530
He told me about the Uchiha Clan's destiny.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.200
He knows all about hatred, and took advantage of Nagato.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.240
He's the one fueling Sasuke's hatred too.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.620
I know how evil he is.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.330
He doesn't act out of hatred. He simply exploits hatred.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.120
He's unlike any other foe you've faced, so be careful!

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.330
In any case, I'm going to pulverize Madara

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.030
and bring this war to an end!

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.490
Only then can we talk.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.870
I don't know about Kabuto,

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.660
but Madara is supposedly immortal.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.410
Furthermore, those mobile plants that were restructured

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.950
with the First Hokage's cells…

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.410
You know, those otherworldly zombies…

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.620
Nothing works against them except by sealing.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.990
Talk about an undead army.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.160
Beware of them too!

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.160
That's the only piece of good news.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.370
I don't have to worry about holding back!

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:24.160
That's…

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.080
It's chaos out there in the battlefield!

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.200
We've got to get back and shore up HQ's defense!

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.530
Rasengan!

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:33.830
Naruto?!

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.780
Leave it all to Naruto here.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.780
Those he gives his stamp of approval. Are the only ones I'll give an ear.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.450
They're all enemies!

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.530
Let's do this, Octopops!

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.330
Rasenrangan!

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.780
Rasenkyugan!

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.240
Naruto's attack is affecting the Wood Style,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.870
and turning them back into wood?

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.370
It's just like before…

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.910
This way, we won't be so vulnerable to the effects of his attack.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.660
Mini-Rasen Shuriken…

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.910
Summoning, Mayhem Jutsu!

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.450
All right!

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.160
Yay!

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.330
The fruits of training. Thanks to my mentoring.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:17.490
Yay…

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.740
I'll leave my Shadow Clones and Mr. Gamahiro

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.950
to keep an eye here.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.080
Let's go!

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.870
I'm gonna hit all the battlefields at the same time!

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.490
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.450
It's no good. He caught up to us!

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.580
H-He's…?!

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.830
He's a Cloud Ninja with a Kekkei Genkai!

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.370
Magnet Style Toroi!

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.660
The Hidden Cloud has a Magnet Style user too?

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.660
When he attacks, you must always…

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.660
You Idiot! I said you always have to dodge it!

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.410
Huh? You didn't say that!

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.280
I didn't have time to finish my sentence!

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:13.240
His Magnet Style magnetizes any object that he touches.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.870
And subsequently, anything those things touch becomes magnetized…

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.700
although the effect is not as strong.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.120
You are the first transfer point to have touched the shuriken,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.200
so the magnetic power in your body is…

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.450
Huh? What exactly do you mean?

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.030
Right now, your body is infused with magnetic power

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.620
since his shuriken is magnetic.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.620
Which means, your body and his shuriken

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.240
are going to be drawn to each other.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.450
Which means, in his second attack,

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.240
you won't be able to dodge it!

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.700
That means I'm gonna die!

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.450
I'm gonna die!

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.490
Rasengan!

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.280
Are you guys okay?

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.950
What is all this ruckus?

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.910
Lord Bee! What are you doing here?

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.280
Are you okay?

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.330
You shouldn't be here!

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.330
Those white beings are disguising themselves as our comrades.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.450
I know that.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.870
So this is one of the zombies

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.410
controlled by the Reanimation Jutsu…

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.280
Looks like sealing them like this

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.990
is the only way to stop them.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.330
We were rushing back to Headquarters with Eff

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.620
to tighten the security there, but got separated…

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.950
Eff was actually a white guy.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:43.830
Huh?!

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.160
Things here have gone awry.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.330
Octopops, we have to catch up with everyone else.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.330
Yeah!

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.410
If Eff and the others were imposters…

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.240
– You… – You…

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.200
No, both of us were almost killed by the enemy.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.030
So we're okay.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.660
Y-You're right.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.370
Gotcha!

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.080
Are you trying to kill me?!

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.740
It's your fault for joking around at a time like this!

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.200
We can't retreat any further.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.330
We'll have to make our stand here!

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.330
I agree.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.780
First, the two of us will launch long-range offensives.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.240
We'll see how the enemy responds!

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.200
They were slowly retreating,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.580
but it seems they've made up their minds.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.280
Fighting those from other villages is understandable.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.870
But we are forced to bring ourselves

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.410
to take on shinobi from our homelands.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.910
Damn that brat Orochimaru for controlling us!

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.990
He will regret this!

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.580
I never saw eye to eye with you before,

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.490
but for the first time, I agree with you.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.240
Do not lament.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:30.120
I'm certain our children have grown and surpassed us.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.490
I hope you are right…

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:36.870
Here they come.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.490
First, two of them.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.450
Look at those amazing waves of sand!

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.160
This is Shukaku… The power of the One Tail…

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.990
So they're starting off with the Playing Possum Jutsu?

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.120
Gold Dust?

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.370
I see…

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.280
You were the shinobi who manipulated Gold Dust

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.530
with the Magnet Style…

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.410
It stopped.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.200
Gold Dust is heavier than sand…

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.660
If I mix Gold Dust into the sand, I can slow it down.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.910
I'm impressed that you knew how to counter it.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.530
When Shukaku the One Tail would go on a rampage,

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.580
I'd stop his sand like this.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.990
It's not Shukaku…but Gaara?!

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:58.490
From above…

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.490
You've aged, Ohnoki!

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.830
Do you owe your long life to the Particle Style?

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.280
– Particle Style! – Particle Style!

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.370
– Atomic Dismantling Jutsu! – Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.240
My predecessor's Particle Style… is as powerful as ever.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.950
The sand is even more powerful than before…

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.240
Wait for the signal.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.450
Particle Style…

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.330
Don't tell me that's your former pupil, the brat Ohnoki?

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.030
Now I really feel like I traveled through time!

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.160
It's been a while…Father.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.990
Gaara… Where's Shukaku?

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.780
He's long gone.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:00.330
I am no longer the Jinchuriki that you created, Father.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.160
I am Kazekage now.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.870
It is a leader's duty to eliminate threats against one's village.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.240
We must protect it.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.620
This Reanimation Jutsu may have some merit, after all…

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.870
Let me see what you may be worth!

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.660
Can you defeat me?

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.290
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "A Father's Hope, A Mother's Love"

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.280
A FATHER'S HOPE, A MOTHER'S LOVE Karura, you…

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.730
A FATHER'S HOPE, A MOTHER'S LOVE

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.830
Tune in again!
