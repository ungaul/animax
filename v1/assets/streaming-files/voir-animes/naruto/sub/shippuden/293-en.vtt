WEBVTT

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.420
RECORDING Naruto, Hinata, congratulations on your marriage!

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.440
Huh?

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.400
Oh!

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.700
What're you doing, Sai?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.240
Where's your congratulatory message?!

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.080
Well, I don't think I can say it well.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.080
You're a former Team 7 member!

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.870
You're gonna do this!

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.090
RECORDING Naruto, Hinata, congratulations on your marriage!

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.010
RECORDING Hey, you're being too stiff…

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.970
RECORDING Naruto, Hinata, congratulations on your marriage!

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.220
RECORDING Uh, act more natural.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.560
Like I told you before, I don't think I can say it well.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.440
Naruto! Hinata!

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.020
To the both of you... Have a hot, hot, hot married life!

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.230
Brother Lee, you're way too close…

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.690
When you say it, it doesn't sound like a congratulatory message…

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.070
Something's missing!

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.110
SPRINGTIME OF YOUTH SPRINGTIME OF YOUTH Guy Sensei!

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.120
SPRINGTIME OF YOUTH My dear Lee…

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040
Think if your hot-blooded wish will permeate through the lens

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.450
and be conveyed 100% to Naruto and Hinata

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.870
when your message is played.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.670
It needs something symbolic on-screen.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.800
I know! The sunrise!

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.760
The sun rising over the horizon

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.050
to mark the beginning of their married life together!

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.050
Give your message with the sunrise in the background…

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.560
and you'll increase the impact of your hot-blooded feelings by 300%!

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.680
Don't take them too seriously.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.020
RECORDING Hi Naruto and Hinata! I hope you're well!

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.480
RECORDING What's up with that?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.150
RECORDING Of course, they're well.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.730
RECORDING Hey, enough with the wisecracks!

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.650
RECORDING Tadah!

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.400
Hey Naruto! Hinata!

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.780
How ya doin'?

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.030
Hey Kiba! Don't butt in!

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.240
– Isn't there anyone who's a friend of – I heard you were making

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.830
– Big Brother Naruto who'll let me – a congratulatory video!

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.290
– get a proper message? – I searched for you all over town!

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.540
RECORDING Uh, Naruto, Hinata… congratulations on your marriage....

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.090
Iruka Sensei, you're too nervous, c'mon!

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.220
Sorry, sorry! I'm not good at these sorts of things.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.090
Just say what you feel.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.720
If he hears his mentor, Iruka Sensei, speaking from his heart…

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.310
Big Bro Naruto's gonna cry!

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.230
His mentor? That's going a bit too far.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.650
Okay, let's go for a comment that's deeply moving! Here we go!

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.110
Ah… Um… Well…

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.650
I can't think of anything so suddenly, so can we do this later?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.410
Since Naruto's getting married…

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.830
Naruto's Wedding

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.380
Naruto, Hinata…

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.800
Naruto! Hinata!

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.850
Congratulations on your nuptials…

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.100
That's too stiff!

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.140
Iruka Sensei!
Big trouble!

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.150
Look at what they did to the memorial statue!

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.280
THE THIRD HOKAGE Look at what they did to the memorial statue!

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.780
What do we do?

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.820
Now, Sadoru Sensei, you just became an instructor recently,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.700
so I understand how upsetting this is.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.030
But this sort of thing is quite minor…

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200
Hey!

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.630
Tsukune, Sansho, Mibuna!

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.000
So, this is your doing, after all.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.840
How'd you know we were here?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.680
I know exactly what you're thinking.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.430
We were just playing hide-and-seek!

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.800
Don't go off and treat us like criminals!

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.680
Don't lie!

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.810
I bet you enjoyed seeing Sadoru Sensei having a hard time, didn't you?

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.940
No!

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.650
You don't even like, have any proof. So, stop jumping to conclusions!

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.270
I see.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.730
So, you guys didn't do this graffiti…

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.820
For a prank, it looked pretty cool, so I figured it was you guys…

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.660
Hey, you've got a good eye!

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.990
To tell you the truth, I'm really proud of it!

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.990
Shh!

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.500
Make sure you clean it up completely!

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.250
– Yes, sir… – Yes, sir… You're amazing, Iruka Sensei!

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.010
Compared to Naruto's antics, this is cute.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.470
Naruto?

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.970
You mean, Naruto Uzumaki?

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.930
Were you his teacher?

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.850
Huh? Well, yes… – No way! – No way!

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.190
Naruto Uzumaki, the super-famous Naruto Uzumaki, right?

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.690
He's on a completely different level!

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.780
There's no way an ordinary teacher

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.320
– like you taught him, Iruka Sensei! – Ordinary…teacher?

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.740
You're just trying to inspire us…

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.700
by saying that even Naruto Uzumaki was a bad kid,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.830
so us bad kids should try our best, right?

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.290
Yeah, like, don't make up stories if you want to send us a message.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.790
I-I see…

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.880
Well then…

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.380
While you're at it, rake the yard and clean the toilets!

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.840
– What?! – What?!

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.840
– No fair! – No fair!

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.850
"I really did teach Naruto."

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.140
Even if I said that, students now wouldn't believe me.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.690
Naruto is a super-hero to them.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.900
Oh, there you are!

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.990
Iruka Sensei, do you have a minute?

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.620
Yes?

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.580
Vice-principal? Me?!

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.500
You've been here a long time.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.420
And you're popular among your colleagues.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.880
You would be perfect person for the job.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.380
15 16 17 18

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.850
TEAM 5 TEAM 6

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.760
Lord Kakashi, I've brought you some tea.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.310
Can you drop the "lord"?

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.060
Is anything the matter, sir?

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.310
You seem quite perturbed.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.770
And don't be overly formal.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.360
I'm not used to it.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.410
Anyway, the date for Naruto and Hinata's wedding is set, right?

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.240
I'm thinking of a way for everyone to be able to attend.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.210
I see… If everyone attends the reception,

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.790
we won't be able to fulfill any missions on that day…

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.670
let alone handle any emergencies.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.130
Their close circle of friends are all significant jonin now, right?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.600
It would be a problem if all of them are unavailable.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.140
RECORDING RECORDING Naruto, it's been awhile.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.090
RECORDING I hear you're getting married—

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.310
That's right!

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.850
The previous Hokage, Lady Tsunade,

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.820
had a rule in case of emergencies like this.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.860
Huh?!

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.030
"One: when there is a marriage among shinobi,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.950
the gift that each shinobi will present will be assessed

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.830
to determine who shall attend," it seems…

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.410
Huh?! What's up with that? It's got to be a joke.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.120
It seems like a joke, but it's right here.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.790
You're right!

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:12.010
But this is like eliminating people by the size of their gift.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.840
Perhaps so, but it's the rule.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.100
No one would agree to something

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.560
that measures friendship like that.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.810
I'll be called the worst Hokage in history.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.980
I understand how you feel,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.400
but it's more important to fulfill the responsibility

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.900
that's right before you, as the Hokage.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.280
Welcome!

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.740
I'll have ramen.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.660
Make mine a super-size ramen!

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.410
Oh! Iruka Sensei!

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.700
Did you come up with a congratulatory message?

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.920
Uh no, sorry, I forgot…

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.500
An advancement exam?!

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.340
One of the board officials recommended I take it to become vice-principal.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.800
W-Wh…? Why only Iruka Sensei?

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.350
Does that mean I'm not among the candidates?!

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.970
No, that's not right!

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.720
What's the matter, Ebisu Sensei?

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.730
N-No, nothing's the matter.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.110
But this is a great opportunity!

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.480
Oh?

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.780
His mentor is being promoted…

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.700
This will make Naruto's wedding even more auspicious.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.450
Then we'll have to start calling you Vice-Principal Iruka.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:19.740
Oh, please stop.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.910
I haven't even decided if I'll take the test or not.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.370
Huh?!

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.830
You're not going to pass up a chance like this, are you?!

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.840
Ebisu Sensei, you look sorta glad.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.670
I admit I'm grateful for the chance to be promoted. Besides…

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.720
Naruto Uzumaki, the super-famous Naruto Uzumaki, right?

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.310
There's no way an ordinary teacher like you taught him, Iruka Sensei!

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.730
I know I should strive to get ahead.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:51.570
But there's a part of me that wants to continue teaching kids one on one.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.360
Of course!

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.150
You shine in the classroom, Iruka Sensei. You really do!

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.740
I still think you seem a little too happy…

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.740
What's up?

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.000
Lord Kakashi… Could you drop the "lord" part?

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.920
How long have you been there? I didn't notice you at all.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.670
Well, you were all going on about Iruka Sensei…

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.340
So, I didn't want to interfere.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.390
Lord Kakashi… I mean, Kakashi…

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.100
Is something going on with you as well?

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.430
Oh, no… But what's going on with you, Iruka Sensei?

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.900
He was asked to take the advancement exam for vice-principal!

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.270
Vice-principal?

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.320
Oh yeah, the position is open.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.030
And I'm not sure if I should take it or not.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.120
You? Take the advancement exam?

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.240
Now that would be difficult.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.660
– Huh? – What?!

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.790
Well… I'd better get back to work.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.920
Thanks!

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.090
Thanks for coming—

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.920
Hey, Ayame.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.880
Did you take Lord Kakashi's order?

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:58.880
What?

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.720
Huh?! When did he—?!

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.510
What's going on here?

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.600
Was he talking about Iruka Sensei taking the advancement exam?

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.190
Why'd he say it would "be difficult" for Iruka Sensei?

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.270
I got it!

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.820
As the Hokage, Lord Kakashi doesn't think

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.570
Iruka Sensei is suitable to be the vice-principal!

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.780
– Whaa—?! – Whaa—?!

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.660
That's what he meant.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.570
The advancement exam?

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.200
Iruka Sensei?

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.740
Even if he takes it,

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.710
with Iruka's Sensei's skills and experience,

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.040
getting the promotion would be difficult.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.710
Now, now I didn't say it!

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.260
I'm just surmising what Lord Hokage meant.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.300
For him to say that taking the exam would be difficult…

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.060
It's like saying he knows the outcome

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.640
before Iruka Sensei even takes the exam, hey…

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.890
You gonna stand for that, Iruka Sensei?

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.270
You want to give Naruto something else to celebrate at his wedding, don't ya?

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.400
Dad, don't egg him on like that.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.490
What're you saying? Earlier, even you were—!

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:01.570
I'm taking it!

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.580
I'm going to take the exam and I'm going to pass.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.410
It will be Naruto's biggest day in his life…

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.580
and I'm going to present him with auspicious news!

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.870
Iruka Sensei!

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.790
Well said!

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.920
You're the man!

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:27.890
All right!

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.400
A prank like this is old news.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.190
But Naruto, who used to play tricks like this,

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.190
became the village hero.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.110
Maybe there's a future "Naruto Uzumaki" among you.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.910
Now listen, anyone can become a hero like Naruto Uzumaki!

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.210
So believe in yourself and do your best!

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.880
– Yes, sir! – Yes, sir!

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.790
Not Naruto Uzumaki again?!

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:03.970
What's the matter?!

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.760
Come on, put some more spirit into it!

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.100
Sadoru Sensei, you just have to be confident and

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.730
take on the students head on at times like this!

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.480
– I'm sorry. – I'm sorry.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.650
We're very sorry.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.690
I'll make sure to teach them better

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.190
so that this never happens again, so please…

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.330
Hey, Tsukune… Damaging the statue is going too far.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.000
Iruka Sensei will really get mad this time.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.080
So what?

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.090
I figured you were up to something like this.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.970
I told you, didn't I?

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.310
I know exactly what you're thinking.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.900
I'll say this… you do things on such a small scale.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.400
Why, to Naruto, scrawling graffiti

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.490
on the Hokage's Great Stone Face was nothing.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.650
He even took the Book of Seals and

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.160
wreaked havoc in the village.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.620
So, Naruto Uzumaki really was your pupil?

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:15.950
Shut up!

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.910
Who cares about Naruto!

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.870
I am me!

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.790
Iruka Sensei did?

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.040
Yeah.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.260
He's been gung-ho ever since.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.720
I keep hearing good things about him from everyone.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.010
He's gonna make it for sure!

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.560
Ebisu Sensei, you're looking a little too depressed now.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.810
I'm going out to get a bite to eat.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.900
Ramen again?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.610
Eating ramen every day isn't healthy.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:44.820
Well, that's okay.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.940
You're really gonna do it?

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.280
'Course!

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.530
Lord Hokage is gone. Now's our only chance.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.370
I can pull off anything Naruto Uzumaki did, just as easily.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.950
Let's go!

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.080
C-Count me out!

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.040
Me too!

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.080
Wimps…

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.550
Good evening.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.170
Oh welcome, Lord Hokage!

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.970
Look, could you please drop the "lord."

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.390
Huh? What's wrong Ebisu Sensei? Why are you spaced out?

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.810
We were talking about Iruka Sensei passing the advancement exam.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.690
Huh? Iruka Sensei plans to take the exam?

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.150
Sure, thanks to you, Kakashi!

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.070
Me? What did I do?

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.320
Anyway…

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.570
What a delicious smell!

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.870
Is it ramen?

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.240
Seems like they didn't order pot stickers, though.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.040
Is that what happened?

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.090
I didn't mean it that way.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.750
What do you mean?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.630
Anyway, regarding the advancement exam, they say…

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.840
Lord Kakashi!

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.260
How many times do I have tell you to stop it with the "lord"?

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.220
Never mind that! Bad news!

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.850
The Book of Seals was stolen?!

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.230
Yes. No one knows where it is,

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.980
and all shinobi are now searching for it.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.440
Don't tell me…

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.270
Iruka Sensei!

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.820
Sansho! Mibuna!

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.490
Where is Tsukune?!

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.330
We tried to stop him…

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.870
I knew it…

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.250
See?

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.800
That was easy.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.970
Next, I'll use this and mess up the Great Stone Face.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.340
Stop!

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.220
I knew I'd find you here.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.890
You planned to use a Shadow Clone from the Book of Seals

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.270
and pull off a flashy prank, right?

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.940
You wanna say that you know exactly what I'm thinking, right?

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.440
No, I don't know what you're thinking.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.110
What am I doing?!

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.370
I keep comparing students to the ones I had in the past.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.410
And I can't see into the heart…

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.120
of the precious student that's standing right before me!

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.790
Iruka Sensei…

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.800
I realize it now, Tsukune.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.880
You just wanted to be acknowledged, right?

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.430
And I didn't see that…

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.970
and kept bragging about an old student of mine.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.970
How long have I been a teacher anyway?

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.890
I'm such a fool!

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.020
I'm sorry!

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.400
Please forgive me!

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.070
Did you mean it?

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.280
Huh?

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.900
About what you said…

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.740
Anyone can become a hero like Naruto Uzumaki!

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.540
So believe in yourself and do your best!

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.160
Yeah. Of course!

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.050
'Kay then… I'll try a little bit harder.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.930
SEALED I'm very sorry about what my student did.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.680
I take full responsibility.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:02.810
Oh, yeah?

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.350
Then check and confirm the inside for me.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.390
Huh?

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.190
"To me, love is life. Love is everything, you see?!"

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.820
MAKE-OUT PARADISE There's no way I'd place the real thing

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.610
where it can be stolen easily.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.490
True…

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.870
By the way, Iruka Sensei… About the advancement exam…

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.290
You were right, Kakashi.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.620
That position is far more than I can handle right now.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.500
Huh?!

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.500
No, no… When I said it was going to be difficult,

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.260
I meant that the advancement exam

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.300
is on the same day as Naruto's wedding.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.090
What?

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.350
You are his mentor, Iruka Sensei…

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.270
You can't miss his wedding, right?

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.180
So, that got me thinking…

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.560
I'm thinking of reserving another extra day for the advancement exam.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.110
I really want you to become the vice-principal, Iruka Sensei,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.950
and serve as a shining example to all of the Academy teachers.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.740
I'm sorry.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.700
I'm not going to take the exam, after all.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.950
I got carried away about going to Naruto's reception

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.750
as the newly promoted vice-principal

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.080
and forgot about my student who was right before my eyes.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.750
I've failed as a teacher.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.840
I have no right to go celebrate with Naruto.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.800
First, I must take care of my current students

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.970
and cherish the things right before me.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.770
Then and only then, can I properly congratulate Naruto.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.980
Cherish the things right before me, huh…

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.280
…it's more important to fulfill the responsibility

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.110
that's right before you, as the Hokage.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.160
You're right. I've decided too.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.870
Huh? What did you—?

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.750
I asked you to assemble here today

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.590
to relay something as your Sixth Hokage.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.720
Listen. I am giving you a secret mission

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.340
in which you shall each prepare a congratulatory gift

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.010
for Naruto and Hinata's wedding.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:12.270
Have it ready and report back one week before the reception.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.690
A wedding gift?

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.310
That's great!

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.860
– He has it all planned. – What a drag.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.940
Leave it to Lord Hokage!

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.030
That is all.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.990
Kakashi, what is going on?

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.040
We're going to assess each gift and give it a ranking to determine

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.250
who will attend the wedding reception

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.750
and who will be placed on duty for that day's missions.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.840
In other words, we're going to sift and screen through the gifts.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:45.180
But that's like measuring their friendship?!

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.760
Yeah…

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.270
But what's most important is what's right before me, right?

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.980
I'm prepared to be called the worst Hokage in history.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.900
"The worst Hokage in history"?

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.400
It's all thanks to you, Iruka Sensei!

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.700
Wha—?

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.320
What?!

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.890
31 MORE DAYS UNTIL THE WEDDING

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.840
Guy Sensei, what makes a good wedding gift?

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.760
Since this is for Naruto… Naruto..to…to…

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.090
Toilet paper…pa!

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.100
Pa? Pa..pa… Oh, passion fruits?

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.890
Ts…Ts…Tsunade's big chest, duh!

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.810
Duh? Duh…duh…dumb bells!

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.810
Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.900
"Hidden Leaf Story, The Perfect Day for a Wedding, Part 2: A Full-Powered Wedding Gift"
