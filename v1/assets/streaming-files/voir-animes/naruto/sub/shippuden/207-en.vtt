WEBVTT

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.980
What is it?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.440
I see…

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.030
Lots and lots of shinobi?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.230
According to these birds… It's a war, right?

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.780
We should find Sasuke before we get mixed up in this war.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.370
Eyes That See in the Dark

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.330
Hidden Leaf Home Watch Unit 1 reporting.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.080
We've completed patrol of the eastern sector.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.580
No incidents to report.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.990
Hidden Leaf Home Watch Unit 2 reporting.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.700
We've completed patrol of the western sector.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.410
No incidents to report.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.870
Unit 1 will now patrol the northern sector.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.280
Unit 2 will head for the southern sector.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.780
Do your best, Konohamaru.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.200
You too, Watase.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.830
It feels like we're in the battle and it's sort of exciting.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.910
Yeah, this feels real.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.370
Hey! This is not a game!

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.870
If wrestlers and boxers show up again,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.530
we have to protect the Hidden Leaf Village! Got it?!

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.200
– Yeah! – Yeah!

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.030
You bastard!

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.490
I'll kill you!

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.830
What was that voice, Konohamaru?

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.770
INTEL DIVISION You're gonna pay!

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.030
That's the Intel Division over there.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.200
I get it. It's the prisoner.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.780
Prisoner? Who?

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.660
Sasuke's partner…

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.870
from the group called Akatsuki or Taka or something.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.700
I'll never forgive you!

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.740
Let's go. It'll all be okay!

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.280
Die, you bastard!

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.620
But you're so handsome!

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.740
But how dare you try to kill me!

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.780
Karin… Since you managed to be taken hostage,

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.450
you're nothing but a burden to me.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.450
Why that—!

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.620
Idiot! But I still want you!

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.950
No… He tried to kill me! No forgiveness!

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.660
But he's so handsome!

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.990
What has she been doing?!

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.330
It's a hand-drawn picture.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.200
She keeps talking to it. Poor thing…

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.990
She must've gone through hell.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.910
Oh… that picture of Sasuke?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.030
Aren't we supposed to confiscate that?

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.950
I tried to. That's when she went nuts.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.740
She'll stay calm if we let her keep it.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.280
It's just a picture. That's all.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.410
Okay then, why don't we play a nice, quiet game of cards?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.330
Sure.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.780
It'd be great if Sasuke were here at this hideout.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.240
This place is special, after all.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.330
Orochimaru's favorite spot.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.660
Hey, Sasuke… Are you here?

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.530
The size of this hideout is ridiculous.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.280
What's wrong?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.030
Nothing. My head just started hurting.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.950
Is he going to go on a rampage again?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.200
Sasuke, Karin and Jugo… Hebi, Taka or whatever…

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.200
I'm the only normal one among us.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.830
Suigetsu… What is it?

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.160
Something's always bothered me about you.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.740
Oh yeah?!

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.780
Well, I'm always concerned about you.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.330
You keep me on pins and needles.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.620
I'm here because I made a promise to Kimimaro.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.580
Why are you here?

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.240
Are you in Team Taka just to cause trouble with Sasuke and Karin?

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.410
Why?

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.700
Yeah, why?

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.200
Why, huh…?

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.370
I knew it was you.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.490
The fact that you're here must mean you killed Orochimaru.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.330
Yeah.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.030
But never mind that. Let's get you out of here.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.950
Free at last. Thank you, Sasuke.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.370
Suigetsu, you're the first.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.240
Come with me.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.830
Me, first? There are others then?

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.080
Two others. I'm taking Jugo from the northern hideout

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.330
and Karin from the southern hideout.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.620
Of course you picked me,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.530
but I wonder about your other two choices, Sasuke.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.620
Enough with the rambling. Put on your clothes. We're going.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.160
Can I ask you something?

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.330
What is it?

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.530
Why are you recruiting men?

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.620
I have a goal…

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.870
And I have a better chance of achieving it with a small team.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.200
Ever since I approached Orochimaru, I've been waiting for this moment…

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.200
and I've been selecting highly skilled shinobi in preparation for it.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.370
Oh.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.120
Now… I have all the members I had in mind.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.620
So I'll tell you my goal.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.200
My goal is to kill Itachi Uchiha of the Akatsuki.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.490
And I want your help for that.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.240
Naturally, I won't force you.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.620
Karin… You said you had business to take care of.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.330
What will you do?

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:52.950
W-Well… On second thought, it's not that urgent…

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.370
Karin… Be honest with yourself.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.620
Isn't being with Sasuke all you really want?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.870
Th-That's not true! Whoever said such a thing?

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.830
That's…! Um …!

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.780
See, I hit it right on the mark.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.240
That's why you're speechless. So obvious.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.240
I know all about it…

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.620
Long ago… you had a crush on Sasuke…

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.780
Suigetsu, don't get Karin so worked up…

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.280
I thought I told you to be cooperative.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.330
All right… Sorry Karin,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.200
But as much as you hate it, I'm sticking to Sasuke like glue.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.950
At least until I possess one of the Seven Hidden Mist Blades…

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:45.490
the Great Blade, Samehada, of Kisame Hoshigaki, Itachi Uchiha's partner.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.330
Then it's all set!

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.830
From this point on, we move together.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.280
And henceforth, we will call ourselves… Hebi.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.580
Why?

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.620
I would love to break those two losers up for good!

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.740
I can't help it!

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.200
I just want to break everything in two!

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.660
You're reprehensible, you know that?

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.910
On that scale, Sasuke is the worst of all.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.200
What?

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.330
Well, he beat Itachi, so I thought he had reached his goal already.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:54.490
We are no longer Hebi. From this day on, we are Taka.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.870
Taka has only one goal.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.660
We will…

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.870
destroy the Hidden Leaf!

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.910
I mean, give me a break…

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.660
Teaming up with Akatsuki to capture the Jinchuriki of the Eight Tails?

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.700
He got us mixed up in one outrageous mission.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.160
Are you the Eight Tails' Jinchuriki?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.030
No, it's Lord Eight Tails. Okay?

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.370
Say, "Are you Lord Jinchuriki?" Okay?

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.450
We are capturing you.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.280
Suigetsu, you take the right.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.240
Jugo, you take the left.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.490
Karin, get behind me.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.160
Eight Tails! Sting like a bee!

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.830
Sasuke!

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.740
And this is the finishing sting!

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.030
Sasuke! Let's do this together!

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.660
The fact is, this guy is super strong.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.740
We should go at him as if we are trying to kill him,

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.240
instead of trying to take him alive.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.950
That way we can probably take him down without killing him.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.830
An ox-octopus monster… That's his true form?

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.620
I'll take over from here!

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.830
Run while you can!

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.910
Suigetsu… Sasuke!

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.950
You think I'd let you get away after what you've done, fool, ya fool!

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.870
All of us nearly died that day…

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.160
Somehow, we managed to finish the job.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.080
But next thing we knew,

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.330
we were crashing the Five Kage Summit!

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.660
And we ended up in a battle royale against Raikage and the rest of them!

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.700
His attack, huh?

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.580
No…!

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.080
Jugo, don't waver. This is a genjutsu.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.620
You may have seen through the genjutsu, but…

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.700
it's too late!

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.200
And when the fist fight was over,

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.950
he razed the ceiling and didn't give a damn about us…

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.410
W-What the hell?!

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.580
Thanks to him,

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.830
we ended up as prisoners in the Land of Iron.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.660
I hate all of you!

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.990
I lead you idiots to water,

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.450
and you just splash it in my face instead of drinking it.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.700
That's why…

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.370
Yikes, he's on a rampage!

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.240
Is he out to kill?!

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.200
Die!

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.120
I hate you most of all!

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.330
Huh?!

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:05.910
This is…

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.600
I've been here lots of times…

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.430
I never knew this existed.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.270
Is this one of… Orochimaru's secret rooms?

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.060
Huh?

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.770
Huh?

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:50.980
What?

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.390
This is… Orochimaru planned all of this?

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.930
If so, this intel could change the outcome of this entire war!

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.430
What are you doing?

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.480
This might be a very nice present for Sasuke.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.100
We found something incredible by chance!

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.060
Jugo… that punch is water under the bridge…

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.140
Snap out of it, Jugo.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.020
We've got to find Sasuke quick!

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.270
The birds are uneasy…

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.770
Over there.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:51.980
Let's go.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.060
You didn't waste any time coming after me.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.100
What are you doing here?!

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.020
Or not…it seems…

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.600
I passed by two towns on my way here,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.230
but they were deserted.

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.180
I thought something wasn't quite right outside.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.480
Do you know anything about it?

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.350
We asked you a question first!

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.480
How come you're outside?!

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.640
What happened to our original that was with you?

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.180
If you don't like the fact that I'm out,

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.810
why don't you catch me?

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.180
Especially since you outnumber me this time.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.350
You didn't kill our original, did you?!

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.230
With this many of you,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.350
I hope it's more of a challenge this time.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.850
Susano'o!

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.560
Sharingan!

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:20.770
It's a war… Take down the enemy.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.060
Looks like Madara's started things.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:29.850
Capture Killer Bee and Naruto Uzumaki.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:38.980
Sasuke… If you attack the Hidden Leaf, I will fight you.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.060
Save your hatred until then.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.180
At that time, throw all of your hatred at me.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.890
The only one who can handle all that hatred…is me!

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.230
Fine then!

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.560
I'll kill you first.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.310
If you don't hurry…

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.270
More and more of his friends will join up with him…

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.100
one after another.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.140
You're someone who knows the pain of solitude like I do.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.640
And that pain makes people stronger.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.430
And for that very reason, by cutting that bond,

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.770
I will be able to obtain even greater strength.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:22.930
Have you forgotten, Naruto… What real power is?

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:28.680
I feel the Uchiha getting freed from this rotting shinobi world.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.890
And isn't what I'm doing exactly what you Leaf shinobi have wanted all along?

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.140
You've always snubbed and put down the Uchiha.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.810
So, I'll help erase the Uchiha from your memories!

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:47.600
I'm going to kill all of you, all of the Hidden Leaf!

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.060
Severing all bonds to the Hidden Leaf is the ultimate purification!

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.270
And that shall lead to the Uchiha's true restoration!

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.180
I'm going to where you are…

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.980
To cut you down.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.230
You're not Hidden Leaf shinobi.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.640
You're not part of the promise.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.890
These are good eyes.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.140
I'm quickly getting used to them, Brother.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.100
When you have the same eyes as me, come before me.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:42.180
The scenes burned into these eyes… that once belonged to my brother…

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.230
are disgustingly sad... They weigh me down.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:51.560
But that's only fitting. Just you watch, Brother!

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.930
There is no shinobi alive today who is as powerful

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.770
as the First Hokage, Hashirama Senju.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.480
Everyone says that.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.230
Just like they think the Sage of the Six Paths' power

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.140
was also a fairy tale.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.680
It's time to show them that all the fairy tales were real!

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.980
No one can stop this Reanimation!

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.430
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "A Will of Stone"

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.100
I guess I am too old…to do anything!

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:09.060
A WILL OF STONE Tune in again!
