WEBVTT

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.210
I…

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.670
detest you.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.540
Hagoromo…

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.330
Hamura…

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.000
You…

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.880
are mine.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.210
My role has come to an end.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.250
You shall return with me to the almighty god that is Mother.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.460
You two aren't…

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.130
You two alone aren't the entirety of shinobi history!

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.630
Besides…

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.380
moms are supposed to be happy about their kids leaving the nest!

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.710
That's what being a mom means!

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.420
Your teenage rebellion continues.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.330
Mother is the very progenitor of chakra.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.170
You brats can't hope to accomplish anything.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.130
Naruto, we need to make an opening, so we can launch the Sealing Jutsu.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.540
Yeah!

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.790
And the only thing that will work… is that jutsu!

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.460
The No. 1 Most Unpredictable Ninja

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.380
"That" jutsu?

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.710
Yeah…

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.460
Sasuke, hear me out.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.210
I don't know what you're scheming, but Mother absorbs all jutsu.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.080
Your actions are meaningless.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.080
How is it going?

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.080
Looks like they're just staring each other down.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.000
I see…

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.540
The power to forcefully drag us all into this dimension,

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.330
that isn't genjutsu…

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.630
This is on a totally different scale.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.330
She's like…

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.580
…a god.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.880
How do you plan on fighting someone like that, Naruto?

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.080
This could be the end…

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.080
But we gotta give it our best shot.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.420
Just like we've been doing all along, right?

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.670
Are you serious?

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.960
We won't know unless we try.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.500
I've been secretly practicing this jutsu

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.000
even more than the Rasengan, ya know?!

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.670
It's worth giving it a shot, right?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.580
If there's a chance it'll create an opening…

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.630
Fine. I'll get my left eye ready.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.750
Let's do it!
Yeah!

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.880
Amaterasu!

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.920
They're making a move!

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.290
Take this!

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.880
Sexy Jutsu:

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.170
- Reverse Harem Jutsu! - Reverse Harem Jutsu!

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.830
Sexy-type jutsu tend to work better on stronger opponents, ya know!

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.210
That idiot! Using a jutsu like that in this situation?!

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.210
That might work on me, but there's no way that jutsu

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.460
will work on someone so god-like!

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.000
It worked?!

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.040
You may be the progenitor of chakra or whatever…

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.460
But I'll bet you've never seen a jutsu like this!

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.040
This is the history of shinobi, ya fool!

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.460
The number one most unpredictable…

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.080
Don't tell me that Naruto's Pervy Ninjutsu

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.960
is going to save the world!

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.290
I believe that Naruto is the Child of Prophecy

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.670
who will save the world.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.710
Perhaps he's a throwback to another age in the Leaf's Shinobi Way.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.580
He's more like me than Minato, and he can be very endearing.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.420
Master Jiraiya, are you watching?!

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.380
Now, Naruto!

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.080
Right!

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.790
It's cold! What's going on?!

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.130
Ice?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.210
It changed!

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.630
This place… Did we shift dimensions again?

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.210
Whose jutsu effects are we seeing, Naruto?

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.210
Huh?!

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.130
Uh, this is probably…

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.040
It feels the same as the time we were taken

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.670
to that previous lava world.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.130
There's no mistake that this is our enemy's ability.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.460
To be able to rewrite the world in an instant and make it reality…

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.750
This really is just like genjutsu.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.460
An ice world this time?!

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.130
On what principle?

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.580
She vanished!

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.250
This ability… Can she move across dimensions?

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.170
Why that—!

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.250
Amaterasu!

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.420
Flame Control!

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.750
Thanks, Sasuke!

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.080
Sorry the Sexy Jutsu didn't work.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.130
I never really expected that kind of jutsu would work.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.040
This time, we're going with my strategy…

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.380
Help me out.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.290
Mother… These two are quite annoying.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.040
Why don't you split them up already…

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.040
and take them on separately?

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.580
Where am I?

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.250
Sasuke!

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.080
Damn it!

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.040
Now you won't be able to seal Mother away.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.670
First, I'll suck out all of your chakra!

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.130
You have nice reflexes.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.210
First, I have to find Sasuke!

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.540
This child is fast.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.000
So I guess I won't be able to tell where she's gonna strike from…

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.130
What is that?

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.500
Is it possible that…

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.880
we're the only ones who were brought to this world?

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.170
No. The real me is here too.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.540
But I can't sense Sasuke.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.540
Where am I?
Obito!

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:06.670
Is that you, Kakashi?

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.710
I thought I died…

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.670
I healed you.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.880
Naruto!

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.130
But…

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.670
Yeah…

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040
I know.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.960
What happened to Madara?

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.170
Did you take him down?

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.880
No, things ended up a little differently.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.920
I'll explain it simply.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.040
Might as well tell you guys about The Sage of the Six Paths

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.040
and Kaguya too, and that seal!

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.170
I don't know what happened,

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.500
but I assume you didn't defeat the enemy yet?

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.210
Take me to where the fight is.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.000
You can tell me on the way.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:57.540
I can't sense Sasuke… And my real body feels tingly.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.420
It might be real dangerous over there!

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.210
I don't know if we'll be helpful or in the way.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.630
But I don't want to fail because

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.540
we weren't there when we were needed.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.170
Besides, if we don't bring down this Kaguya,

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.000
our world is done for.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.170
The few of us who are left have to do whatever we can…

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.250
We had our minds made up from the very start, right?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.170
That we're all ready to die.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.410
Nothing seems to work…

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.910
It's hard to believe.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.620
So both your powers and Sasuke's are necessary

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.870
in order to seal away this Kaguya?

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.330
Yeah!

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.660
But like I said earlier, I can't sense Sasuke at all!

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.780
The ice…is moving.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.990
Over there!

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.080
She's merged with Nature!

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:26.740
Naruto!

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.830
She's finally showing herself.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.080
What's happening?

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.870
That's a form of Time-Space.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.330
Damn it! It's no good!

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.120
Okay… I've made it look like I'm restrained…

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.830
I'll just wait until she gets closer!

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.950
You said you suddenly stopped sensing Sasuke?

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.950
Yeah.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.120
I suspect he was taken to another dimension.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.120
She emerged from a different Time-Space.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.120
It's similar to my own Visual Prowess.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.160
Can you enter it?

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.580
If I resonate my Kamui

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.410
the next time she connects and opens a portal to another Time-Space,

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.660
I'm positive I can enter it.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.410
If Sasuke is there, I can bring him back to this dimension.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.410
All right!

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.990
Then I'll go and support the real me.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:37.950
However…

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.450
I'll need an enormous amount of chakra to do it…

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.030
since it's not my own Time-Space.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.080
If my chakra runs out while I'm there, I'm done.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.410
Then I'll go with you.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.120
The real me won't go down that quickly.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.030
Because I'm strong.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.410
Your Clone Chakra isn't enough.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.950
Would it still be inadequate with my 100 Healings Chakra?

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.330
That would give me the bare minimum.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.080
Both of you, come with me.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.030
All right!

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.450
We don't even know if Sasuke is in that Time-Space.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.530
But we'll start by getting into close range with her.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:26.530
I promise to find Sasuke, and deliver him to the real you.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:29.950
Obito.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.990
Thanks for rescuing me…

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.160
And Sasuke too.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.660
Don't thank someone like me.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.280
Just keep an eye on the enemy.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.620
So no more masks, huh?

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:07.160
I'm…Kakashi's friend, your father's subordinate,

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.950
I'm an Uchiha just like Sasuke…

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.870
and…

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.660
The Hokage is someone who endures pain

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.990
and takes the lead in front of everyone…

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.450
There is no shortcut to becoming the Hokage!

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.950
There are no ways out for the one who becomes the Hokage!

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.580
The way he forges ahead draws others towards him.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.080
He makes you want to reach out when he's about to stumble.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.990
I…

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.700
I am your senior who dreamt the same dream as you.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.530
I'm not going to waste time on a speech,

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.160
because I'm almost out of time.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.530
But…I just ask that you let me walk in front of you…

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:00.990
and die for you.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.240
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.910
Have you learned anything yet?

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.080
There's no one here.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.160
Just the lower half of Madara's body.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.030
Does finding Madara's lower half mean

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.530
that we should consider him dead?

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.120
I have a bad feeling about this…

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.200
Either way, it seems he completed his Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.370
And apparently, it doesn't affect us dead…

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.740
How did things go on your end, Fourth Hokage?

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.240
I cut part of the tree

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.870
to try to free the people entrapped in the jutsu,

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.620
but they didn't awaken.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.700
Instead, another branch immediately wrapped itself around them.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.780
So it was the same for you.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.830
In order to verify Madara's status, and find out what happened,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.740
we should use his lower half to revive him with the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.160
Then we'll make him talk.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.120
To do that, we'd need a living sacrifice!

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.450
How can you be so naïve at this point?

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.490
There has to be another way!

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.740
You truly are a kind soul,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.240
previous reincarnate of Ashura.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.700
Wh-Who are you?

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.950
My name is Hagoromo.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.530
As the founder of Ninshu, the Ninja Creed…

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.620
I am also known as The Sage of the Six Paths.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.580
You're The Sage of the Six Paths?

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.630
In order to save Naruto and Sasuke,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.470
who are battling my mother Kaguya right now…

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.760
you must know everything that has occurred.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.140
Before I talk about Ashura and Indra,

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:06.100
I must first explain the origin of Ninshu, the Ninja Creed.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.940
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Ninja Creed"

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.910
It was some thousands of years ago… NINJA CREED

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:35.430
Tune in again!
