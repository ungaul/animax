00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.330
A dream, huh...?

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.070
What was that...all about...?

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.100
Hidden Leaf Library

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.800
Nightmare

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.630
In order to have others quickly understand you...

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.730
first you must get closer to their spirits.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.730
For example, when calling people by their names,

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.300
it is impersonal to call people using "san" or "kun."

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.700
You will never get closer to them like that.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.130
You might first try taking the plunge

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.600
and call people by their first name only...

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.530
or try using a nickname or term of endearment.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.970
If you do that, others will feel much more familiar about you...

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.730
as a special person...

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.430
I get it...

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.030
Oh, found it.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.530
What...? Isn't that Sai?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.170
Make-Out Paradise is...

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.900
Did you come looking for a book of paintings or something?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.430
Sakura...

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.370
So, you read books, huh...?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.170
Well...a little bit.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.630
So even Sai has quite a human side to him, huh...?

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.730
Naruto and I were just on our way

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.670
to visit Kakashi Sensei in the hospital...

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.070
Why don't you come with us?

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.230
Kakashi...Sensei...

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.930
You're on Team Kakashi too, so you should meet him...

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.800
Revenge is everything to me.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.170
If I can carry out my revenge,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.300
it's no concern of mine what happens to me, or to this world.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.470
But if I can obtain the power to accomplish that

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.930
by giving my body to Orochimaru,

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.470
then I'll give him as much of this life of mine as he wants.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.600
I can see it now...

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.430
So this is your unknown power, huh...?

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.100
Who would've thought...

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.270
you'd have something like this inside of you...

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.330
Why did I have that dream...?

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.230
Naruto!

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.000
What? Sai's with you, too?

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.370
I bumped into him at the library.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.500
Oh...and here I was working out my plan to walk with you,

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.970
just the two of us, like we were on a date!

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.870
If you've got the time to be doing that,

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.830
you should be studying up on Ninjutsu or something!

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.000
Study, huh...?

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.670
How can you guys even go to a stuffy place like that?

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.200
You should train your mind a little and not just your body.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.630
You're really an idiot, after all.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.400
I knew it... Sakura is calling Naruto only by his first name...

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.200
That's harsh, Sakura.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.970
N-Naruto, S-Sakura...

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.270
Could you guys include me in the conversation, too?

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.800
Oh! Well, I read in a book...

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.930
about how to open up to other people right away...

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.730
And in the book, it said to call people by their first names only

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.500
and to use nicknames and terms of endearment...

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.470
It said if I did that there would be a sense of friendliness

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.330
and we'd be able to get along right away.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.630
Oh, so you're concerned about stuff like that, huh?

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.170
So that's what you were doing in the library...

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.330
Yeah.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.100
And...I was thinking about nicknames

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.900
and terms of endearment for you guys...

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.500
But I couldn't really come up with anything good...

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.330
So I'll just call you guys by just your first names for now...

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.870
I can't believe Sai would think so seriously about us...

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.830
You don't need to think about stuff like that.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.870
It just happens naturally!

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.170
For nicknames or terms of endearment,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.330
you should just say that person's character trait.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.130
For example, if you're talking about Naruto...

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.900
Idiot Naruto! Or moron Naruto! Or something.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.400
Sakura, you're taking things too far with that.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.330
I get it...A person's character trait...

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.830
I can't believe this is Sai...

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.170
He's totally different from when I first met him...

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.170
Huh...?

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.900
You don't have to stare at me like that...

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.130
Thank you. I've got the hang of it now...

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.900
Ugly.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.600
Sai, you're really taking things too far with that!

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.270
Huh? What do you mean?

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.500
Sakura, why'd you have to hit me, too...?

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.070
I see... You're the new team member.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.330
Sai, was it? Nice to meet you.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.500
Right.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.630
Sakura, come here for a second.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.770
Those two are hurt... Did they fight or something?

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.800
It'd be no stretch of the imagination with someone hot-tempered like Naruto...

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.170
N-No, nothing happened at all... We're all getting along fine!

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.700
Oh, I see...Then I guess it's okay.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.500
This is Kakashi Hatake,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.330
the one rumored about in the Anbu Black Ops Training Division.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:38.600
Naruto...

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.770
Yeah...

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.370
Kakashi Sensei... About our previous mission...

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.830
I heard about everything from Yamato.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.330
About Sasuke, too...

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.900
We don't have time...

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.070
At this rate, he'll soon be...

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.500
But I can't bring Sasuke back with the power I have now...

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.000
He's gotten too powerful...

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.270
Well then, you just have to get more powerful, right?

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.900
But...the speed of Sasuke's development was extraordinary even in my eyes.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.330
When I asked Lady Tsunade,

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.030
she said there's a possibility they're using Forbidden Jutsu

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.370
and perhaps drugs in his training...

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.570
And they've got Kabuto with them, so...

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.930
There's probably no way to find out, in a book like this,

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.230
how people who conduct experiments on humans think...

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:39.600
Then we just have to rapidly get more powerful.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.330
But how do we do that?

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.070
Did you think I was just lying here not thinking about anything?

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.530
I thought about that the whole time.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.800
And...I figured it out.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.730
However, this approach is suited for Naruto...

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.870
Or...rather I should say it's an approach only Naruto can do.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.470
In that training...

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.570
in a sense you might just exceed me, Naruto.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.600
I'll...exceed you, Kakashi Sensei?

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.130
That's right.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.300
I'll be with you the whole time on this training.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.500
And it will be a different type of training...

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.000
Wh-What're we going to do...?

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.570
We're going to create a Ninjutsu of ultimate strength just for you.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.130
In other words,

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.230
you're going to learn a new Ninjutsu that will exceed the Rasengan.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.300
However, the acquisition of such a power

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.700
will require an enormous amount of time and effort.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.570
You can't get strong instantly after just a few days

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.170
like the hero in a novel.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.300
And it's completely different from

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.470
being carefully taught and learning a Jutsu

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.370
like the Rasengan that has already been created.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.070
An enormous amount of time...

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.770
But I just said we don't have time! Sasuke will be...

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.070
What I'm saying is, I figured out a way to do it in a short amount of time.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:19.900
How do we do it...?
Well...

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.230
How're you doing, Kakashi?

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.830
Asuma Sensei, you could at least knock!

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.930
Hello.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.070
Why it's Naruto and Sakura...

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.870
Is your mission already...

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.500
You're that guy from back then...

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.770
Wh-Who is he...?

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.970
Why is all of this happening so suddenly today...?

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.300
Relax. First, smile...

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:53.630
Hello.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.900
Thanks...for the report.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.230
I'll be going now.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.030
The Akatsuki activity is finally getting into full swing.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.870
It's only a matter of time

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:11.200
before they start churning things up around the Leaf.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.800
Indeed, this is a significant crisis.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.270
But that's also our chance to attack them.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.930
We can't just sit around anymore.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.800
Hidden Leaf Hospital

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.630
Oh, so that's what was going on.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.470
I buy that.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.000
My name's Sai. Please just call me by my first name.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.870
Hey, he's pretty cute... He kind of resembles Sasuke, too.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.830
On the outside. But he's quite different on the inside.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.600
He can't really read the mood of a room, you see.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.930
I heard about Sasuke from Lady Tsunade.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.430
I'll help you guys out in the future should something happen.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.200
I'm finished with those troublesome Chunin Exams, after all.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.300
You missed out on becoming a Chunin again, huh?

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.130
Yeah...

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.300
Well, I guess that was the least of your problems, huh...?

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.800
What're you doing here with the whole gang in town?

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.130
This isn't a break room, you know.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.730
That's right... You guys go on ahead to "Barbe-Q."

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.270
You guys from Team Kakashi should go too if you want.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.670
Yay! Barbeque!

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.130
I second that!

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.030
I'll sit next to Sai!

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.230
I need to talk to Kakashi alone about a few things.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.970
The barbeque is on me, okay?

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.930
Hey, just a minute!

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.300
Listen! Listen!

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.470
What about the rest of the discussion about my training?!

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.000
That's right...Hmm...

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.270
Well, we'll get to that later.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:08.000
Later?! I'm really curious about it!

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.970
Well, we can't start training while I'm still in the hospital.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:13.930
Don't be so impatient.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.800
What took you so long, Sakura?

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.870
What? Where's Shikamaru?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.200
He said he was going home

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:30.330
because he has to get some horns for medicinal use with his father.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.230
No kidding?

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.700
He always shows up for end-of-mission parties...

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.100
This is a first for him...

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.770
She isn't taking my advice...

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.330
All right! I'll eat Shikamaru's share!

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.430
Hey, Choji!

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.670
We have to introduce ourselves to Sai before we eat.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.100
Oh, oh...right.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.500
It appears things have started getting turbulent outside the land...

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.330
I knew it...

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.870
As long as their objective is the Tailed Beasts,

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.930
it's a foregone conclusion that they'll target this village,

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.330
I mean, Naruto.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.670
There's no need to leave me out, right?

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.130
I'm also concerned about Akatsuki developments.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.530
Will Naruto...be okay?

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.770
If those guys from the Akatsuki attack...

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.230
Even Gaara couldn't...

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.800
Well, he probably won't be okay.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.770
Right now anyway.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.730
Hi...

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.530
First meetings are very important in order to quickly open up to people...

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.400
I have to decide on nicknames and terms of endearment right away...

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.800
Uh, I'm Choji Akimichi of the Akimichi Clan.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.070
Nice to meet you. Uh, you're Sai, right?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.570
Nice to meet you...uh...

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.630
Character trait...character trait...

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:08.130
Don't tell me...

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.770
He's not going to say that taboo word, is he?!

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:14.330
Fa...

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:22.170
Sai! "Fatty" is absolutely a taboo word in front of Choji. Got it?!

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.030
Did he... start to say something just now?

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.000
No, it's nothing... I see.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.200
It sure is tough coming up with nicknames...

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.230
My name's Ino Yamanaka.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.170
My family owns the Yamanaka Flower Shop.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.530
Nice to meet you.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.630
In the case of a girl,

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.500
saying a character trait just makes them angry...

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.470
In other words, if I say the opposite...

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.400
Don't do it, Sai...

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.670
Go, Sai! Let her have it good!

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:11.630
Nice to meet you...uh... pretty lady.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.430
Why do you say that when it's Ino?!

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.430
Stop it, Sakura!

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.000
Rat, Snake, Monkey, Rabbit, Rabbit, Rooster, Ox, Ox, Monkey, Rat...

00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.300
Ram, Dragon, Boar, Boar, Horse Rabbit, Rabbit, Dragon, Tiger, Rabbit...

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.730
Rooster, Boar, Snake, Dragon, Rat Rat, Boar, Dragon, Snake, Monkey...

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.970
Snake, Rooster, Ox, Snake, Snake Horse, Horse, Ram, Rooster, Dog...

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.270
Dog, Dragon, Rat, Rat, Tiger, Rooster Dragon, Rabbit, Monkey, Monkey...

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.400
Ox, Snake, Rabbit, Dragon...

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.830
Wrong one, huh...?

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.070
Okay, time for some training.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.700
What is it?

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:46.330
Well, it's been a long time since I've trained with you.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.300
And I don't really know why, but I'm glad.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.130
I see.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.670
Laugh it up while you can.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.030
The purpose of this training is

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.370
to create a Ninjutsu of ultimate power just for you.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.500
It will be a Jutsu that will exceed the Rasengan.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.500
It will be a Jutsu that will exceed the Rasengan?

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:06.770
Next time: "Wind"
