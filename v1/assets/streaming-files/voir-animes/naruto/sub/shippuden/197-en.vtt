WEBVTT

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.610
Damn, I can't tell.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.570
I can't sniff out the transformed fakes.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.030
You're back, Shino!

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.440
Yeah…

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.530
Be careful.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.480
There's no telling where the enemy will come from.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.690
So you were one of them… Damn it! Byakugan!

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.480
It's no good.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.530
I can't distinguish them from their chakra.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.400
Are you a fake?

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.070
Stop! I'm the real one!

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.280
Not being able to tell which ones are the transformations is…

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.440
Do not step out of the circle!

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.150
Anyone who does will be considered an enemy transformation!

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.230
Choza, we're getting nowhere with this.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.610
Yes, I know. That's why we have to wait.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.070
Wait?

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.940
For what?

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.400
Understood? No one moves!

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.610
We can't tell who's an enemy transformation.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.900
More Reanimated Shinobi may appear.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.400
Anyone who moves will be considered an enemy.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.820
So do not move!

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.570
In the meantime, our wounded will keep increasing…

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.730
We have no choice, but to wait.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.440
Lava Style!

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.320
Dissolving Jutsu!

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.280
There's no end to this.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.320
We have to do something about the real ones though…

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.280
Lee, don't get hit!

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.280
Why you…!

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.440
Do not panic!

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.530
Surround them!

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.820
I've detected a new enemy!

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.280
It's a small unit, but the chakra is unusual…

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480
It's…

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.690
Madara!

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.360
What did you say?!

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.570
Madara is leading a small unit.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.030
Can you tell who makes up his unit?

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.400
This chakra is…

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.690
Fourth Mizukage!

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.610
The one who was a Jinchuriki?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.440
There's no mistake.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.690
The rest are all Jinchuriki too!

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.110
I can't believe he had more pawns under his control…

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.730
Where is…Naruto?

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.030
Reinforcements Arrive

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.610
I finally caught up!

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.440
You're late! What were you doing?

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.230
A persistent pee, yo.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.900
Sheesh! It sure took long!

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.480
Had some other problems too.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.610
Anyway, one of your clones contacted me.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.820
What happened to the other clones?

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.980
They should be arriving at the frontlines of every battlefield.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.570
All the fakers we'll seek out All the bad guys we'll defeat, no doubt

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.440
We gotta hurry too!

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.400
Shikamaru… How long do we have to stay like this?

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.400
If that huge one comes back, won't we be in trouble?

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.070
At least until Naruto gets here.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.650
Until then, do not step inside anyone else's circle.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.480
If you do, even you will be considered an enemy.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.070
We just have to verify what we know about each other!

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.820
That won't work either.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.780
Several of our guys fell for that.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.280
Sometimes, a lucky guess ends up being correct.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.030
This is dull…

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.820
Uh-huh… Sorry. Please be patient a bit longer.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.320
Yeah, I understand.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.230
You're here!

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.070
Finally got here!

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.030
Nawaki?!

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.730
Is he here?!

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.610
Oh, good. He's gotten real flashy though… Naruto!

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.730
Naruto?

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.110
He looks just like Nawaki…

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.530
We received word from HQ. I'm glad you came.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.570
But… I'm surprised that Lord Raikage gave the okay for this.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.480
Well, Granny Tsunade convinced Pops Raikage for me.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.320
Tsunade sent that boy?

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.570
Just who is he anyway?

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.400
The Nine Tails is sealed inside him.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.980
The adults call him the Jinchuriki.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.480
That boy?!

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.150
He's my idiot classmate Naruto, who's been talking big

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.440
about becoming Hokage ever since we were little…

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.570
Don't you think "idiot" is a bit harsh, Shikamaru?

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.190
Well, I'm here and I'll find every one of 'em!

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.360
But now, he makes you believe it actually might be possible.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.230
Lady Tsunade has hedged all her bets on him.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.570
Naruto, huh…

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.940
So guys like Nawaki and me exist in this period too.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.940
So let's take down the transformed white ones, everybody!

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.440
Yeah!

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.610
Right!

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.820
O-Oh…

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.820
First, that guy over there!

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.610
Huh?!

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.480
The rest of you around me are genuine.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.480
Those of you with Naruto's seal of approval can leave your circle.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.730
Consider anyone else who jumps out the enemy! Let's go!

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.110
Hey, stop! Stay away!

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.320
Help!

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.030
Do not approach!

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.280
What's wrong?

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.110
He can still be saved with Medical Ninjutsu!

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.030
Stay away! I told you not to move.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.480
There's no way to prove that you're allies!

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.980
But if we remain like this…

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.530
He'll die!

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.570
I'm begging you. Please save him!

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.320
Don't let my husband die in my arms!

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.360
Hey! What are you doing?!

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.400
If you don't trust me, I'll kill myself right here!

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.730
But please save my husband!

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.070
Hey, stop!

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:03.730
Come with me.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.610
You can't. What if…?

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.730
What if they're comrades? I must tend to him.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.980
Thank you.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.280
Sakura!

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.530
Are you all right, Sakura?

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.570
Naruto!

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:34.900
Naruto…?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.400
Looks like you're all right!

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.730
Gentle Fist!

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.150
It was a fake, after all!

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.780
This side is bad. Hinata is…!

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.980
Neji!

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.230
Damn it… I won't make it in time!

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.730
Hinata!

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.070
This one's… a transformed one.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.030
Who's next?!

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.110
The two in front on the left.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.230
Got it!

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.070
No way!

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.860
Neji! Where are you going? This way!

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.980
Sorry I'm late.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.320
Naruto…?

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.440
Is that Naruto?

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.440
He smells different from before!

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.780
It's all right now!

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.400
Are you all right, Hinata?

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.530
Yes.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.610
Summoning Jutsu!

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:48.280
Finally. Looks like he's managed to successfully groom that brat Nagato.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.570
I didn't think I'd be summoning you…

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.980
If I'm not mistaken, you're…

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.570
The user of this Reanimation Jutsu has a keen understanding of war.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.690
To think of using you…

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.690
Did you say "Reanimation"?

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.480
This is not the Rinne Rebirth Jutsu…?

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.940
Why weren't we notified right away that Naruto was here?

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.530
Naruto just arrived.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.610
I happened to see him first, but I was in the midst of a battle.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.360
Naruto smells differently from before.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.650
I wouldn't have noticed.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.530
But you're the one who sees long distances, so…

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.440
He looks different from before.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:39.320
So is his Chakra Nature… Then who are you to talk?!

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.190
Are you really Naruto?

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.070
I hope you're not a White Zetsu fake too.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.940
I'm Naruto.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.820
Can you prove it?

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.280
It's Naruto.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.730
You can tell by looking in his eyes.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.530
Hinata…

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.860
Besides, he came to my rescue.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.530
Naruto saved me too.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.530
When did you get here?!

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.400
I'll have you know that your fake appeared not too long ago!

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.230
I'm the real deal.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.860
And I've been here with Naruto since.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.320
I'm sorry, Naruto.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.400
Everyone is so suspicious.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.280
Now that I'm here,

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.190
you don't have to fight a defensive battle anymore.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.400
I'll search out the fakes one by one.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.400
All right, Naruto! I've memorized your new scent.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.320
And your chakra.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.570
Well, smell and chakra don't matter much with their transformation.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.900
They mimic everything, even chakra.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.980
But don't worry!

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.480
As you saw, they turn into trees when I bring them down.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.530
And when I'm in this mode, I can sense their hatred.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.360
I'll find the fakes, so let's beat 'em together!

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.900
The one we're supposed to protect is always protecting us.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.440
I'm really useless.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.030
Don't let it bother you, Hinata.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.400
You protected me twice already.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.110
I can't let you keep doing that. It's not cool!

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.820
I-I wasn't worried or anything…

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.030
I can see it in your eyes.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.820
Don't be so hard on yourself! You are strong!

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:31.570
Don't come!

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.400
Let's go.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.690
Which one's the fake?!

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.320
The one with the axe!

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:39.980
All right!

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.650
And him too!

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.150
Thank you, Naruto.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.610
Not so fast!

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.360
All right!

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.530
Do it, Sai!

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.980
Sealing Jutsu… Crouching Tiger Bullet!

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.610
All right! Three more left!

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.320
Are you all right, Sai?

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.690
Yes… I can continue.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.530
No need to worry. Keep drawing the tigers.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.190
I've got your back.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.530
And here come the enemy reinforcements.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.480
A whole lot of them too.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.650
They're white…

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.480
Are these the ones that can transform their chakra and everything else?

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.690
Things are about to get wild, Kakashi.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.940
Our reinforcements have arrived too.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.530
Or should I say, reinforcement…in singular?

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.570
Naruto has the Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.480
I can't use it now, not in this situation.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.650
This time, we'll win with quality, not quantity!

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.190
And so…

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.440
Things have changed, Kimimaro!

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.820
I can tell that time has passed by looking at you.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.190
It seems you've grown in ways other than just height.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.360
Here I come!

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.530
I put too much force into it…

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.940
What happened?

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.400
He's just as scatterbrained and rash as ever.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.940
For sure… Impossible, is that…?

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.320
Oh yes, it is.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.730
Naruto has arrived at every battlefield!

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.610
Good.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.860
Naruto has joined up with the Fourth Company.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.110
And the Former Kage of the Wind, Lightning, Earth and Water…

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.570
have all been successfully sealed.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.030
What're you gonna do next, tiny old man?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.690
I said I'm the Tsuchikage.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.400
We should rendezvous with another company.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.860
Our enemy is not the Reanimation.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.360
It's Madara.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.820
This war will not end until he is brought down.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.900
Our target is Madara!

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.400
Octopops and I should be heading there now.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:36.980
Over there!

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.360
– The combined First and Second Companies – And those guys too!

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.030
have detected just about all the enemies!

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.150
Earth Style!

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.400
They're advancing with incredible momentum.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.980
What was that?

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.690
Sorry, Bushy Brow!

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:00.280
The Third Company also seems to be dominating!

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.190
Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.400
– This is… – huge!

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.440
The Fifth Company has the upper hand as well!

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.440
Cha!

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.530
The Medical Unit has suppressed all their enemies.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.190
It worked!

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:36.070
The tide of battle has turned overwhelmingly in our favor.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:37.860
See?

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.530
Humph!

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.780
Now we just need to stop Madara

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.110
who is approaching with Jinchuriki in tow.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.610
We should focus our remaining strength there

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.570
and hit him with all we've got!

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.150
J-Just a minute!

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.530
What is it?!

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.860
The enemy is resisting Gaara's Fourth Company!

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.530
But…what is this chakra?!

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.400
Huh? What is this?!

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.230
What are you sensing?

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:09.820
Over there!

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.610
What is it?

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.400
Hm?

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.730
That's the Second Tsuchikage!

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.320
I thought Gaara sealed him away!

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.530
Impossible… He used Fragmentation in that state…?

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:25.690
Fragmentation?

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.480
Lord Mu was able to split his body and create clones.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:35.480
No… Not clones. It's closer to say he can split his body into two.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.480
Although his strength would be cut in half too.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.980
It's not him!

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.400
There's someone else!

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:44.610
What?!

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.940
Hey, there's one more!

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.610
H-He is…!

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.530
Who is it?

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.320
You've come at last!

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.400
Madara…

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.400
Uchiha!

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.530
That's him?

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.030
So that's what he looked like beneath the mask.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.780
He looks exactly the same!

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.900
What's going on?!

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.480
What do you mean?

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.480
Look closely at his eyes.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.070
That's a Reanimation!

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.690
The Reanimation Jutsu brings the dead back to this realm…

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.030
Which means he had been dead!

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.730
Wait a second!

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.530
I thought HQ reported Madara elsewhere,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.820
approaching in the other direction with a bunch of Jinchuriki, right?

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.570
But there's no mistake… He's Madara Uchiha!

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.480
The one I fought when I was young.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.690
Then who's the man…

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.360
behind the mask?!

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.900
If the one before us is the real Madara…

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.780
then the masked guy we thought was Madara…is not Madara?!

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.110
So it seems!

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.400
What is that?

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.190
No way…!

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.610
Is that really ninjutsu?

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.440
We can't outrun it!

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.940
He's out of our league!

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.480
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Madara Uchiha"

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.230
Is this the power of a god?

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.440
MADARA UCHIHA Tune in again!
