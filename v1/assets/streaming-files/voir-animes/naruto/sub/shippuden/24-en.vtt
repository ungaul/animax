00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.500
Here I go!

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.370
Over there, huh?!

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.130
Sakura!

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.030
Cha!

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.670
The Third Kazekage 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.930
That noise just now... What happened?

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.800
It sounds like it came from the direction of Sakura and Granny Chiyo...

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.230
But I've no way of verifying that...

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.570
And the radio is out of range now...

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.870
I've seriously got to hurry...

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.170
Damn it! We can't make any progress just by chasing after him!

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.400
Kakashi Sensei! You're too slow!

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.430
We'll lose sight of him if we don't get a move on.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.800
It'll be okay!

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.070
His next target is you, Naruto!

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.400
He won't run off so far that he shakes us off completely.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.870
Then hurry up and tell me how to stop him!

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.370
Don't worry. I've got several strategies in mind.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.670
I'll need a little bit of time to prepare for that!

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.300
I can't wait around for that.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.970
I want to save Gaara right away!

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.570
I don't know what their strategy is,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.300
but I'm sure lucky the Jinchuriki is so simple-minded.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.230
I'll stir things up so they can't prepare.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.270
I wonder if they can keep up with my speed.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.830
Damn it! Hold it!

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.970
Wait, Naruto!

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.100
Sure enough, I guess I can't get through to him now...

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.430
I have no choice.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.670
I'll quickly finish things off with that...

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.730
Guys, did you all... hear that noise?

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.930
Yeah! Loud and clear.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.270
It sounds like it's coming from the enemy hideout...

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.170
That noise! What in the world is going on?!

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.330
Can you see what's happening, Neji?

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.300
I'm in the middle of fighting right now...

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.700
So it'll be tough to convey anything precisely.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.300
The enemy hideout is collapsing at an incredible rate!

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.230
Did you say collapse?!

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.270
What does that mean?!

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.900
Did Sakura and Granny Chiyo win?

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.430
Or did they get beaten?

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.470
No, I can't say which for sure.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.400
Because...

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.200
They're both fighting an evenly matched battle.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.500
Did you say evenly matched?

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.970
I'd expect no less from Sakura!

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.530
I also must not lose!

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.230
She's got impressive strength for a little girl.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.630
In just this short time,

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.070
she's starting to read Sasori's attack patterns.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.570
So much so, that she can do just fine even without my help.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.030
I never thought she would be this good...

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.530
She's an impressive girl.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.870
She's got impressive strength for a little girl.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.370
In just this short time,

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.800
she's starting to read Sasori's attack patterns.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.170
So much so, that she can do just fine even without my help.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.830
I never thought she would be this good...

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.200
She's an impressive girl.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.130
That Tsunade sure has herself a good pupil.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.300
Listen up, Sakura.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:59.070
For Medical Ninja, attack ability is of secondary importance.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.970
Do you know why?

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.070
Yes!

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.800
Medical Ninja play a supporting role in the unit.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.400
Comrade support in battle is more important

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.070
and I think medical ability comes first!

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.030
Wrong!

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.330
What's most important is the ability to dodge an enemy attack.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.200
The ability to dodge...?

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.500
A Medical Ninja absolutely must never get hit by an enemy attack.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.430
Why is that?

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.630
Who's supposed to heal the members of the unit

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.970
if the Medical Ninja dies?

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.400
Now I'm going to attack you for real.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.430
This is training for you to dodge all of my attacks...

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:42.970
I won't hold back!

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.470
Now I'm going to attack you for real.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.730
This is training for you to dodge all of my attacks.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.830
I won't hold back! Are you ready?!

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.230
Y-Yes!

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.270
Don't shut your eyes!

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.430
What's the idea shutting your eyes in front of an enemy?!

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.700
Watch the enemy's movements closely!

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.100
Before their attack, during their attack, after their attack!

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.600
Don't overlook any little movement!

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.130
If you're any kind of sorry excuse for a Shinobi,

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.670
you've probably heard of this.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.800
People each have dominant hands, dominant legs and habits.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.570
For many different reasons,

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.070
a fixed pattern is revealed when they move.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.600
Once a Shinobi becomes a Chunin or a Jonin,

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.330
they train to reduce those habits

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.770
so as not to telegraph that pattern to an enemy...

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.730
But it's not something that can be completely eliminated.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.930
With that, you should be able to see an enemy's weakness!

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.230
An enemy's weakness...

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.470
You have to find that weakness as fast as you can!

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.800
Then you should be able to improve your ability to dodge attack!

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.400
His fingers always move before he attacks...

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.500
That's obvious since he's controlling the puppet

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.000
with the Chakra strings on his fingers...

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.730
But that's the weakness of a Puppet Master.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.970
And I've started to read the direction of Sasori's attacks

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.670
with the patterns of his finger and arm movements.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.070
She's watching very carefully...

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.770
At this rate, this will be too time-consuming...

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.730
I have no choice but to use some Chakra.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.500
I guess I'll finish her off with that...

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.130
Iron Sand: Unleash!

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.670
Its range is huge!

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.270
This is not good!

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.330
Sakura!

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.230
Sakura, are you okay?!

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.900
Listen carefully, Sakura...

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.530
First, get close to him

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.670
and smash the puppet with your incredible strength.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:32.000
However, you must dodge all of his hidden device attacks.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.230
All of them, perfectly!

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.800
You must not even get a scratch.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.700
Poison, right...?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.470
That's right...

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.670
Even a scratch can turn into a fatal wound.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:58.570
She's been poisoned!

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:03.100
Didn't I tell you... "That's not all there is"?

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:04.870
As I suspected,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.730
he soaked his Iron Sand with poison, huh...?

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.370
The poison is starting to take effect...

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.730
Soon your body will go numb and you won't be able to move.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.770
You'll last three days if I leave you be...

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.330
But I've no intention of doing that!

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.900
You're finished...little girl.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.300
Sakura!

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.400
Say, what can you do in three minutes?

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.130
Oh, I can make instant noodles.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.070
You're too soft.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.870
I can cut green onions on top of that!

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.630
Then, I can munch on snacks on top of that!

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.800
Then, I can brush my teeth on top of that!

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.470
You're being soft. If I sleep with my clothes on,

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.570
then in three minutes, I can get out of bed and head straight to the mission

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.630
with a noodle in my hand!

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.970
Wait! Don't tell me you plan to do that without washing your face first?!

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.470
- I always do it that way. - Say what?!

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.500
Naruto! Brushing your teeth and washing your face is a daily etiquette!

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.870
What, really?! I didn't know that!

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.370
Next time: "Three Minutes Between Life and Death"
