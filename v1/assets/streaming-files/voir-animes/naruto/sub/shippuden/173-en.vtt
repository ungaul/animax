WEBVTT

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.650
Fate deemed that I would fight you again.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.690
I owe you one for last time.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.530
My own puppet, huh…

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.400
That body is worthless to me now.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.860
Because now, I'm finally a real doll that will never rot away!

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.820
This is the body that I had always wished for!

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.570
Run…

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.440
Captain! The guy from the Foundation…

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.730
He's got that clay inside his belly!

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.400
I once heard that Deidara's detonating clay

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.070
is weak against the Lightning Style.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.570
I still have a little…

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.030
Take Kiri and the injured behind that rock!

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.400
Kiri, focus only on healing them!

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.900
Too slow!

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.400
Now!

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.480
Secret Black Technique! Salamander!

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.980
Brother!

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.230
 Sai and Shin

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.730
An explosion?!

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.480
In any case, our reinforcements will crush the enemy.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.860
Zaji! What's happening out there?!

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.110
It's okay. I can still read their chakra.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.570
Everyone is alive!

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.480
Owww…

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.190
We're lucky to be alive.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.690
Sai!

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.570
The Salamander, eh…

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.070
So he surrounded the bomb with a defensive puppet he had hidden.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.780
Because of that, the blast didn't have much force, hmm.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.860
You called him…a bomb…?

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.230
You're gonna complain about that?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.320
You're trash. You can never be Sasuke.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.610
So shut the hell up, weakling!

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.530
As long as his soul clings to this world,

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.400
I can revive him as much as I want.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.570
I'll turn him into another bomb!

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.690
Brother…Shin…

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.570
I…

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.820
don't want to hurt you.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.030
I died…

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.570
and was liberated from the Foundation.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.480
I've heard about the Foundation of the Hidden Leaf.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.320
You're raised together from the time you are young,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.820
like siblings… Then in the end,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.570
they pit you against one another in a death match.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.860
It is a training system designed to destroy your emotions.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.570
Where there is no feeling, there is no doubt.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.360
That makes a truly powerful shinobi.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.400
Deep down, you are just like me.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.400
Don't act like an artist just because you can draw a little!

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.610
Art is an explosion!

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.280
I think it's time for another big blast!

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.900
Just try it!

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.440
I have a drawing I want to show you, Brother.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.730
Really? Let's see it.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.440
What is it?

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.940
I'm not finished yet…

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.400
so can you wait a little longer?

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.730
Secret Black Technique…

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.230
Damn! I should have just detonated myself earlier!

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.440
It's so tacky to exhibit one's ultimate art over and over!

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.480
But I guess I have no choice!

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.650
Hmm!

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.730
Lightning Style?!

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.690
Triple Iron Maiden!

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480
Nice job, Omoi!

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.480
I'll use my Puppet Jutsu and keep these two tied up!

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.570
Do something about Sai's brother!

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.570
Right!

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.530
I knew that if I remained in the Foundation,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.980
I would have to face you in battle.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.400
So let's settle now what we couldn't back then.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.320
That's my kunai. I guess I win.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.110
I'll bet it collided mid-air and was knocked off course.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.110
I have no luck…

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.070
Luck is a skill too.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.820
It's decided. You're on meal duty today.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.070
Are you all right?

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.110
Stay away!

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.480
It's nothing.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.070
Okay…then it's okay.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.570
Hey…

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.110
How long has it been since we came here?

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.610
Why?

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.400
I was just wondering if we're going to keep on living here.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.190
You and Lord Danzo are the only ones I see.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.280
So I'm starting to lose track of time.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.400
Not that it matters to me.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.530
I want to stay here forever with you, Brother Shin.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.400
That's right.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.820
What is this?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.320
Open it.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.690
It's…a sketchbook.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.030
Yeah.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.610
You've wanted one for a long time.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.690
I bought it the last time I went into town.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.400
Thank you, Brother!

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.440
I know. I'm going to draw pictures of you and me in here.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.480
Huh?

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.820
It'll be a picture book that tells about you and me.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.320
Okay.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.730
Show it to me when it's finished.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.070
Promise me, man to man. I'm not kidding!

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.820
Uh-huh!

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.070
What did you say, Lord Danzo?

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:44.320
I'm ordering you two to fight to the death.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.400
That's…

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.150
This will be your final test.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.480
And it is also your fate, as ones in the Foundation.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.480
And after three days, if you two are still alive

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.190
and attempt to descend from this mountain…

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.900
You will die. Understood?

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.440
That's impossible… I can't fight with my own brother.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.730
Then…I will kill you!

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440
Brother!

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.190
Are you serious?!

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.280
Brother!

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.150
You are much too gentle to make it out alive.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:02.570
Brother…

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.440
But you are the one who will live.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.400
I'm sick.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.820
We must get you treated.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:27.650
It's useless. I've already looked into my illness.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.110
It's incurable.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.400
That's…!

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.360
Lord Danzo doesn't know about this.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.320
Report to him that you dealt with me.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.440
I can't…

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.610
I knew all along that the final test of the Foundation…

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.440
is to kill a comrade.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:52.860
Huh?!

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:59.280
So I didn't tell you that I was sick until this day.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.730
I tried to live with this secret.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.190
So that I could lose to you in a swordfight.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.280
However, I don't even have enough strength to pull that off.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.940
Brother, I also knew that I would have to fight.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.820
But I never expected it to be you…

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.610
Is that so?

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.400
You must kill your emotions.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.780
Otherwise, duty will destroy you.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:39.570
Now go…

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.030
And live my share too.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.400
Brother…

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.530
I'm still capable of ending my own life.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.610
Go!

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.480
Don't cry! Didn't I tell you to kill your emotions?!

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.610
I understand.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.570
I wish I could have seen… your finished drawing.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.780
Settle that last match…huh?

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.110
Are you all right, Sai?

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.360
Sai… I see, so that's your name now.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.030
However, it won't happen.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.360
Brother…

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.070
So you finished it.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.650
I finally got to see the picture I longed to see…

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.860
It's as though…

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.480
your drawing has freed my soul from its bindings.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.440
Sai, these comrades who call you by your name…

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.280
Cherish them.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.440
Thank you…

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.230
What's going on?

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.980
The strings are slack…

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.730
Sasori… Sakura told me how you fight.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.360
Back then…

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.980
The girl who was with Granny Chiyo.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.690
Cha!

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.690
This is a jutsu I personally sealed.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.610
I didn't think I'd ever use it again.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.940
But it seems it won't work out that way.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.320
Now let's put an end to this!

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:02.780
There's so many…

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.780
I'd expect no less from you, Granny.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.530
It's said the number of puppets they can use

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.440
measures the ability of a puppet master.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.820
Granny Chiyo's secret "Number of Fingers."

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.570
I'd heard rumors about it.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.280
The device you used to bring down a castle by yourself…

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.570
The Secret White Move: Chikamatsu's 10 Puppets.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.400
The ten masterpieces by Monzaemon,

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.360
the first puppeteer of the Puppet Master Jutsu.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.730
It's a great collection of puppets.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.480
However…

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.650
I used this to bring down a nation…

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.650
Secret Red Move: Performance of a Hundred Puppets!

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.980
The source of your power lay in your soul.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.530
You once turned yourself into a puppet,

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.650
and tried to erase your soul, but you couldn't do it.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.780
I can feel it inside this puppet that you made,

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.820
where your undying soul dwells inside.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.440
But now, you are living flesh,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.650
but that's merely a human shell that has degenerated into a puppet.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.400
You were a first-rate shinobi puppet master.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.860
Not some lowlife that allows someone else to manipulate you.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.610
If I'm not mistaken, you used Kabuto as a spy back then.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.820
Now, he's the one using you.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.440
It's over when a puppet master is the one being manipulated!

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.230
And whether it's you, or Kabuto, the one who is controlling you…

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.530
There's no way I'm gonna lose…

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:57.320
Because I am the ninja puppet master of the real Sasori puppet!

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.030
Your techniques and the puppets you created will never decay.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.190
As long as there are future puppet masters

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.480
to inherit the soul that resides within them!

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.440
So that is precisely the true form of art I sought…

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.320
Quit joking around!

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.150
My man Sasori!

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.820
Don't pay any attention to this jerk, hmm!

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.570
Art is a single flash of light!

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.650
Art is an explosion!

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.320
Are you listening, Sasori?!

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.230
The soul of the creator resides within, eh…

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.900
You're right…

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.230
Kankuro…

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:47.150
What is it?

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.780
I entrust you with the "Father" and "Mother" puppets.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:01.230
And when you die, bestow them upon another…

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.570
Those two are…

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.480
Yeah…of course, I understand.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.030
Hey! My man Sasori!

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.320
This is a sacrificial victim… What's going on?

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.570
I heard that one couldn't die under the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.320
Maybe Kabuto released the jutsu?

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.570
Let me out, you bastard!

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.610
It doesn't seem that way.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.610
– Hey, can't you hear me? – Sasori is gone,

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.440
but the loud one is still here.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.480
We thought the Reanimation Jutsu had been perfected,

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.070
but it seems to have a flaw.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.150
It's not that easy to control emotion.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.440
Looks like it's over.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.730
Nope…this is just the beginning!

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.570
Sai, Omoi, Zaji!

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.440
Head out for immediate ambush.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.900
– Yes! – Right!

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.610
What is it?

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.230
Oh, nothing.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.230
The Reanimation Jutsu…

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.440
There are still so many mysteries behind it.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.320
But I have a good idea of how it works now.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.860
Madara, head out to the battlefront.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.400
I'll hide and focus on the jutsu.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.610
This woman…

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.860
She had gotten this close to our hideout.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.530
And Kabuto was aware of it.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.650
So he purposely lured her here?

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:55.360
That damned Kabuto…

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.480
Since the beginning,

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.280
he's planned for the Allied Shinobi Force and us to destroy each other.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.900
But that won't happen.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.480
I'm the one who will use you.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.230
Prove to me right now

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.320
that the Reanimation Jutsu requires living bodies…

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:45.860
And, you will tell me all of its secrets.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.570
And if I refuse?

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.820
You will never acquire what you desire and

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.400
what you desire will become something else…

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.440
It will be your life!

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.780
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Secrets of the Reanimation Jutsu"

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.570

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.730
SECRETS OF THE REANIMATION JUTSU

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.570
