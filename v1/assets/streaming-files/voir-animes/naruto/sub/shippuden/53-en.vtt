WEBVTT

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.330
Why...?

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.400
Why don't you get it?!

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.030
Soon, Orochimaru's going to take your body!

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.530
If it happens, it happens...

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.030
You're still a kid, Naruto.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.670
Revenge is everything to me.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.530
If I can carry out my revenge,

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.070
it's no concern of mine what happens to me,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.230
or to this world.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.530
Put simply, neither I nor Orochimaru can defeat Itachi right now.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.770
But if I can obtain the power to accomplish that

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.100
by giving my body to Orochimaru,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.400
then I'll give him as much of this life of mine as he wants.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.530
Title

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.800
The talking's over.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.370
Naruto and Sakura...

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.170
I didn't want to do anything rough in front of you guys...

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.600
but I'm going to get serious now.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.270
Captain Yamato!

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.330
What do you mean, serious...?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.600
I can't just let those

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.330
who left the village in the same way as Orochimaru run loose.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.130
So I'll do whatever I have to do to haul Sasuke back to the Hidden Leaf.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.670
The Hidden Leaf, huh...?

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.600
I've had enough of you guys...

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.100
It's over.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.930
Orochimaru...

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.930
Don't bother with that Jutsu, Sasuke.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.900
Let go of me...

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.570
Hey-hey...

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.730
Don't talk to Lord Orochimaru like that...

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.870
I've got no reason to stop.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.230
You know what the Akatsuki are up to, don't you?

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.000
We want these guys from the Hidden Leaf

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.600
to take care of the Akatsuki for us.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.570
As many of them as possible...

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.770
Your revenge won't turn out well

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.270
if the other Akatsuki get in the way, right?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.730
That's a pathetic reason.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.730
It should increase your chances of revenge, even if only by one percent...

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.930
Isn't that right?

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.330
Let's go.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.730
Once again...

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.900
Once again...I couldn't stop him...

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.100
I'm...totally weak...

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.330
Crying...

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.700
Crying won't bring Sasuke back home!

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.130
I'm here! I'll get stronger with you!

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.600
We've got... close to six months left, right?

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.130
It goes without saying that three are better than two.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.300
Besides, I'm pretty strong myself.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.070
Thanks...

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:04.600
Now then...

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.730
This is just the beginning...

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.670
I see...

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.270
Hidden Leaf Hospital

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.770
What did you say?!

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.530
Naruto and the others fought Sasuke?!

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.970
Yes...

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.170
But, their original mission was to...

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:19.530
Yes, their mission was to capture the spy Sasori sent to Orochimaru

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.930
and bring him back to the Hidden Leaf,

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.270
and to get information about Orochimaru and Sasuke as well.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.630
But Sasori's spy, Kabuto Yakushi,

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.730
already had Sasori's Jutsu broken by Orochimaru.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.630
And it seems Orochimaru tried to use this opportunity to kill Sasori,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.230
not knowing that the real Sasori was already dead...

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.130
Naruto made contact with Orochimaru,

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.270
became unable to control his emotions...

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.200
and ran amuck.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.600
Naruto eventually released his fourth tail...

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.770
and went wild.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.530
Orochimaru did battle with the Nine-Tails Naruto.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.270
Even he probably reached his limit...

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.270
Stabilize It seems he tried to disappear

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.700
while Yamato was attempting to control Naruto.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.430
However, Yamato's clone secretly pursued Orochimaru.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.130
Finally, they found Orochimaru's hideout and made their way in.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.800
Then it seems they encountered Sasuke and a battle ensued.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.630
So...then what happened?

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.100
It seems Sasuke has become significantly more powerful...

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.600
I hear Naruto didn't stand a chance against him...

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.030
I see...

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.570
Well, don't get so depressed.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.530
It appears Naruto wasn't able to show his full power

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.670
because of damage from the Nine-Tails Cloak.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.130
And... No. I'm not all that depressed, you know.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.930
I figured Sasuke would be stronger at this point in time...

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.430
And...

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.430
Now Naruto will be more fired up for future training

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.470
after having realized the difference between Sasuke and himself.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.070
Right?

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.300
Right.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.100
Well, I guess we should be happy they made it back safe.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.130
It's fortunate that Naruto was able to make it back safely.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.200
However, although unexpected situations are an inevitable part of missions...

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.400
I never thought he would end up doing battle with Orochimaru...

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.930
And here, it's best to keep Naruto in the village

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.170
because things like this end up happening...

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.200
I don't think that hard-head would depart from his opinions so easily.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.630
So?

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.030
We aren't giving up!

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.030
Okay, I will issue your next mission immediately.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.170
Stand by at home until I contact you!

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:30.800
Right!

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.630
Hey, Sakura. Let's go on a date together.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.530
Have you forgotten what Lady Tsunade said just now?

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.800
Huh?! What'd she say again?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.730
We're supposed to stand by at home

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.630
until Team Kakashi's next mission has been determined, right?!

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.570
What? She won't find out if we just go out for a little while!

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.470
Why don't you go by yourself if you want to go out on a date?

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.430
I won't be able to go on a date by myself.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.100
By the way, what about Sai's activity?

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:08.330
Yes. You were right to be concerned, Lady Tsunade.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.730
Danzo gave him a special mission.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.230
A special mission?!

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.870
I knew it...

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.730
It seems Sai was put in charge of undercover work,

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.200
dealing with potential risks to the Hidden Leaf

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.430
while carrying out his mission as

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.300
an Anbu Black Ops member under Danzo's direction.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.400
Sai's purpose for joining us in Team Kakashi was to bury Sasuke,

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.500
who is to become the new vessel for Orochimaru,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:39.270
the individual of most concern to the Hidden Leaf.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:40.270
What?!

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.700
I figured he was a crafty guy...

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.370
As would be expected of the leader of a hard-line military faction,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.870
his actions are strong-armed.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.030
But our protective feelings for the Hidden Leaf are the same, huh...?

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.230
Are you talking about Danzo?

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.600
Yes, I am...

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.170
Then could you hold off on your conclusions until you see this?

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:13.630
What's this?

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.530
Danzo gave this to Sai as a gift for Orochimaru

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.130
in order for the contact with Orochimaru to proceed smoothly.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.600
Wh-What's this?!

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.630
It's a list of Anbu Black Ops members!

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.170
Damn it! That jerk, Danzo!

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.370
How did he get the list from the classified files...?

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.270
Um...Lady Tsunade...

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.730
Shizune! Tighten security at the classified files storehouse

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.470
and change the deciphering codes for the files. Quickly!

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:49.530
Y-Yes ma'am!

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.930
Right now!

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.900
Damn it! That sly old dog...

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.570
He's always the crafty one!

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.900
At a time when the outside of the village

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.430
is in an uproar with Orochimaru and the Akatsuki...

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.500
I never thought I'd have to be concerned about trouble inside the village...

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:20.170
Now I'll be forced to consider Sai's earlier proposal with caution.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.670
In that case...

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.600
I never thought you'd fail the special mission...

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.270
That's very unlike you...

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.330
I have a favor to ask.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.770
A favor, you say?

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.730
Yes.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.670
Could you keep me in Team Kakashi under this name for a while?

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.470
That smile on his face...

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.430
I've already taken that up with Tsunade.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:20.470
But you understand that emotions create hate, don't you, Sai?

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.370
And hate creates battles.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.100
Bonds of hatred with my older brother...

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.030
That might be so.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.770
But...

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.970
He's the person who acknowledged me more than anyone else.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.800
Sasuke is my friend.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.430
It's a special bond I was finally able to make.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.670
Comrade

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.130
Don't you know what the word comrade is?

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:48.570
Of course, I do. What of it?

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.570
Hey! Sai!

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.300
We're having a meeting about our next mission!

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.770
Hurry up, man!

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.700
Right, I'm coming.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.030
I heard about everything from Yamato.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.400
And I heard about Sasuke, too.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.730
We don't have time.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.670
And yet, we can't bring Sasuke back with our power right now.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.230
The speed of Sasuke's development was extraordinary.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.600
According to Lady Tsunade,

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.970
there's a possibility they're using Forbidden Jutsu and perhaps drugs.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.370
Then we just have to rapidly get more powerful.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.330
But how do we do that...?

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.770
Well, I wasn't just lying here not thinking about anything.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.230
Next time: "Nightmare"
