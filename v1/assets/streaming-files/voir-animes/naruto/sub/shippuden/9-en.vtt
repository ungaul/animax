WEBVTT

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.230
The Jinchuriki's Tears 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.970
There's a Paper Bomb left here, too!

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.770
It's a type that explodes the instant it's peeled off...

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.900
We'll just have to detonate it.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.030
I see.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.970
We're detonating a Paper Bomb!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.170
Stop working and take cover!

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.300
Let's do this.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.730
Now isn't the time to be discussing candidates for a new Kazekage!

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.330
But if you think about the worst-case scenario,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.300
isn't it important to seize the initiative?

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.500
More importantly,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.030
the plan to rescue Lord Kazekage should be the priority!

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.930
Securing village safety is what's important!

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.500
We must not break up our limited forces in conditions like this.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.700
What did you say?!

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.500
Oh, excuse me...

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.070
Reporting!

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.800
An enemy trap has been discovered in the rubble blocking the entrance.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.230
We are currently proceeding with its detonation...

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.570
There have been no casualties.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.670
However, a portion of the entrance collapsed

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.170
due to the effects of the explosion.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.600
It seems it will take an extra half day for repairs!

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.700
Got it. Arrange it so that those who are available are dispatched

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.970
to the repair site immediately.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.830
Yes, sir!

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.230
Hey wait!

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.970
Thanks to Gaara,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.430
the Village Hidden in the Sand was left almost completely undamaged...

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.600
But...we paid too great a price for that...

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.570
Reporting!

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.430
All of the bodies of those guarding the skies have been verified.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.400
There is probably little doubt that the enemy infiltrated

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.570
the center of the village from the sky... Excuse me!

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.200
What?!

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.500
We have been contacted by the tracking unit.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.630
Kankuro was discovered about half a day out of the village.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.630
He is unconscious and in serious condition.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.430
Kankuro...

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.370
Some members of the tracking unit have recovered Kankuro and his puppets.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.270
They are on their way back to the village.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.530
What about the location of Lord Kazekage?

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.400
The remaining members of the tracking unit are in pursuit.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.170
There should be a report soon...

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.300
You're late, Sasori my man...

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.470
I thought you didn't like to keep people waiting.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.530
But...I had enough fun to make up for that.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.570
What's up with that?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.530
Don't get so touchy.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.900
You secured your mission target, the One-Tail, after all.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.500
My mission comes next... after taking care of this guy.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.400
But the one you're after...

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.430
Yeah, I still don't know where he is...

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.470
It'd be easier if he'd just come to me...

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.430
Yeah...That's right...

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.200
What kind of Jinchuriki was he again?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.470
Well, worst case scenario, even if I can't find him...

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.030
nobody can complain since we caught one of the Jinchuriki.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.200
Gaara, we're coming...!

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.330
Naruto! I know you're in a hurry, but don't disrupt the unit!

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.300
But, but...!

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.900
Don't lose your cool...

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.130
Master Jiraiya told you not to, remember?

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.800
For crying out loud...

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.800
Temari!

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.200
Hurry up and get him to the operating room!

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.400
Operating Room

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.630
Is this...poison?!

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.700
Prepare an antidote!

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.070
Gaara...

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.930
Gaara...

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.130
What?! Gaara was...?!

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.330
I was having a bad feeling...

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.000
It'll take about two and a half days to get to the Sand from here...

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.000
Let's hurry.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.470
Right.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.570
Treatment Room 3

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.030
The wounds weren't that serious...

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.800
The problem is...

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.430
The poison, huh...?

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.300
Yes, it's a completely new poison.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.000
We have absolutely no idea how to neutralize it.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.130
Gaara...and now Kankuro, too...

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.800
Taking Naruto is the top-priority duty

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.000
given to us by our organization, the Akatsuki.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.430
It's not so much you that they're after...

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.970
it's what's inside you they want.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.130
But as long as you have the Nine-Tails sealed within you...

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:53.030
they might want to have that power under their own control...

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.800
Naruto! I told you earlier not to disrupt the unit...

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.400
I don't like it!

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.570
Even I know why they're after people like Gaara and me...

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.930
You know it already, don't you, Sakura...?

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.000
That I've got...

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.430
...the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside me...

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.800
Hey, it's that kid.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.130
Eww, let's get out of here.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.630
Gaara and I both... have monsters inside us...

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.570
That's what they're after!

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.670
That's what I don't like!

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.430
They only see us as monsters!

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.600
I don't like their selfish way of viewing us!

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.130
A monster, huh...?

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.430
If that's the case, then we're the same...

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.600
That's right. I was born a monster.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.470
Everything about us... was the same...

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:31.070
And he...fought all by himself a lot more than me...

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.500
Naruto...

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.600
To them, I'm now an artifact of a past they want to erase.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.170
Then why should I exist and what should I live for?

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.670
I thought about it, but couldn't find an answer...

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.830
But I need that reason while I'm alive...

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.770
If not, it's the same as dying...

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.000
The Akatsuki was after him!

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.970
It's just like me this time, too...

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.870
And yet, why does he always have to be

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.100
the one to get the short end of the stick?!

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.770
It's always him!

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.430
That's why I can't be wasting any time getting to him!

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.730
This time, I want to save him right away!

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.500
Naruto...

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.270
Uzumaki...

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.930
Thank you...

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.830
You say Kankuro's regained consciousness?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.100
He has, but he's just barely able to respond to us...

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.300
His condition has worsened since yesterday.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.870
Baki... Is that you...?

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.570
Kankuro!

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.730
It's...it's him...

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.070
Don't raise your voice!

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.500
It's not good for you in your condition!

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.000
Th-Th Red Sand...

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.430
I see... So that explains it...

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.100
Lord Baki...?

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.570
Oh, Lord Baki.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.900
Contact the tracking unit! Tell them to turn back immediately!

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.200
Actually, we haven't heard anything from them

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.970
since recovering Kankuro yesterday...

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.170
We were too late...

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.400
We have no choice but to consult with them...

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.600
Huh? What is it?

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.600
Nothing... I'm...going out for a bit.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.170
Oh, but...!

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.130
Our superiors told us to give them a progress report this morning...

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.500
Do you think I have the time to be leisurely giving reports?!

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.200
Action takes precedence over meetings right now!

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.970
Y-Yes, sir!

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.530
This is what happens as soon as Gaara disappears...

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:57.970
Give me a break...

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.000
I have no choice but to consult with the honorable siblings...

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.930
But I wonder... will they come to our aid willingly?

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.900
Now, now, the food pills are only for emergencies...

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.000
Girls of your age especially need to be careful not to eat too...

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.570
She got mad...

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.770
That's totally sexual harassment... old man.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.330
Naruto.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.270
You've met him before, haven't you?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.370
Itachi Uchiha...

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.970
And he's after you.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.770
I didn't just train over these past two and a half years.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.430
I got into Master Tsunade's library

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.730
and did outside investigations the best I could.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.370
And now... what was bothering me finally makes sense now!

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.030
I wouldn't call it a dream, but I've got an ambition!

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.030
To restore the clan and to kill a certain man...no matter what!

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.200
I'm the only one who can kill him.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.630
I'm an avenger.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.630
I have to become stronger than him...

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.100
I don't have time to be getting tripped up in a place like this.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.170
The person Sasuke wants to kill...

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.230
is his own older brother Itachi Uchiha, right...?

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.770
A member of the Akatsuki!

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.270
Itachi...Uchiha!

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.700
Itachi...Uchiha?

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.530
I'm going to kill you!

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.470
Just as you told me to do,

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.500
I've resented you, hated you, and...

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.800
I've lived...

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.930
I've lived...

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.930
only to kill you!

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.130
Sure enough, you're brothers...

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.000
I see power greater than Itachi's hidden in those eyes of yours...

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.630
Sasuke will definitely seek me out...

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.100
in search of power...

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:46.870
That's why Sasuke is with Orochimaru in an attempt to obtain power...

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.930
But Orochimaru is after Sasuke's body, right?

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.600
And we only have six months left!

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.800
Sakura knows about that too...

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:02.600
And Orochimaru used to be a member of the Akatsuki.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.730
Basically this is what I want...to say.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.030
The closer we get to the Akatsuki,

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.270
the closer we get to information about Orochimaru...

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.000
If that happens...

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.000
we'll eventually get closer to Sasuke!

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.970
And after that, Itachi Uchiha...

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.930
Our worst enemy who plagued Sasuke for so long...

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.070
and the one who's after Naruto...

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.630
This time I'll  save the two of them!

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.900
It appears someone's come...

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.500
Say, Big Sister...

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.500
Hey, Big Sister...!

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.400
Are you dead?

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.770
Gotcha! I was playing dead.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.300
Cut it out. That senility act's too real, Big Sister...

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.700
Honored siblings...

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.600
I have come to request your assistance.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.900
Old books are supposed to be tied in a bundle

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.100
and left up on a high shelf...

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.700
What can we possibly do now...?

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.500
An organization called the Akatsuki has taken the Shukaku.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.500
If we leave things as they stand now, there will be great trouble.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:23.070
It's your generation now. You guys deal with it yourselves.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.830
You two have powerful connections with each land,

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.430
including villages in lands we are not allied with...

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.030
There's only so much information we can gather on our own...

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.830
We've long since been retired.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.200
We no longer have any attachments to the world.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:48.800
Although I guess it'd be nice to see my grandchild's face one more time...

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:50.530
That's very convenient.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.370
Your grandson is a member of the Akatsuki.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.470
Granny Chiyo...

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.500
In this season of cherry blossoms blooming...

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.670
It's the biggest opportunity of the year!

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.170
