WEBVTT

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.770
He has grown.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.100
But...he's still not good enough.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.100
Damn it! This hurts.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.930
But this is...a Genjutsu... I've got to overpower it!

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.770
Naruto...

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.270
Naruto...!

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.670
Sasuke...?

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.770
Long time no see, Naruto...

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.230
I failed to kill you back then, you see...

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.200
You're finished!

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.430
Why...?

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.530
Why...didn't you stop Sasuke? I believed in you...

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.130
You couldn't protect your friends...

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.170
I was counting on you... I'm so disappointed.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.100
You always...

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.000
You always come out ahead...

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.700
You always...achieve happiness...

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.430
It's a Genjutsu...

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.330
I know... it's a Genjutsu, but...!

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.830
Naruto... I believed in you...

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.730
I'm so disappointed... Naruto...

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.600
It's...always you...

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.670
This time...I'll finish you off!

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.870
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.500
I know it's a Genjutsu, but...!

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.400
Say, say!

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.500
I get the part where you temporarily stop the flow of Chakra

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.100
and use a greater Chakra than the enemy's

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.430
to disrupt the flow of Chakra.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.100
But what if that still doesn't work...?

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.600
What should I do if I can't break the Genjutsu?!

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.830
At that time... you give up!

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.330
What?!

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.530
You'd have to accept you were out of luck, and just give up.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.600
That's the way it goes with Genjutsu.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.870
No way...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.670
Then what was the point of falling into the river

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.730
and getting drenched?

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.700
However...if you've got your comrades with you...

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.930
there just might be a chance!

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.770
Get them to touch you and funnel their Chakra into you.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.930
By doing that, you have the flow of Chakra inside you disrupted...

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.200
Then...you can break the Genjutsu.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.430
I believed in you... I'm so disappointed...

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.400
It's always you...

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.030
I'll finish you off!

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.730
Naruto!

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.970
Sakura...

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.730
Naruto!

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.000
Kakashi Sensei...

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.200
Naruto!

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.300
Gaara...

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.070
Naruto!

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.170
Sasuke...

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.000
S-Somebody... give me Chakra...

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.630
K-Kakashi Sensei...Sakura...

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.270
Please...give me Chakra!

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.300
You okay, Naruto?!

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.800
What happened to me...?

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.430
You were caught in a Genjutsu!

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.000
But you're okay now!

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.130
We poured our Chakra in you and broke the Genjutsu!

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.900
Where's...his Shadow Clone...?

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.870
Shadow Clone...? He's using no such thing.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.530
You suddenly started running

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.200
and shot off your Rasengan with nothing around.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.870
Don't you remember?

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.730
Rasengan!

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.270
Then back then... I was already in the Genjutsu...

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.330
This guy's using more than just a Vision Jutsu...

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.870
Now, it's about time for the main event.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.370
Get it together, Naruto!

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.130
Hey! Get a grip!

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.000
Naruto, I'll show you how it's done.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.600
Fire Style...

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.930
Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:12.900
He dodged it!

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.070
Here comes the next attack!

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.800
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.530
The Secret Weapon is Called... 

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.270
Lightning Blade!

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.670
Rasengan!

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.200
Did they get him...?

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.600
Naruto!

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.230
I see... He sure has learned an interesting Jutsu.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.930
However...

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.870
Damn it! I guess it won't be that easy.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.100
I thought I totally got behind him

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.300
using Kakashi Sensei's Lightning Blade as a diversion...

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.700
The Sharingan sure is a problem.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.570
He can instantly foresee what I'm going to do.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.500
Not again!

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.300
This isn't going to work without a combination attack with Kakashi Sensei.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.330
On top of that, I'll need a powerful Jutsu that can beat him in one shot...

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.530
I'll have to try out that Jutsu...

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.970
Where's Naruto...? Is he okay?

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.970
What?! Is this one of his Genjutsu?!

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.500
A Hidden Mist Jutsu?!

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.530
Don't worry! It's one of Kakashi's Jutsu.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.800
Then...

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.770
More importantly, the mist is getting thicker!

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.830
Don't avert your attention away from his presence!

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.400
R-Right!

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.800
The Hidden Mist Jutsu...

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.900
It's indeed an effective Jutsu

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.100
for making it difficult to cast a Genjutsu...

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.500
But it's meaningless against me, who possesses the Sharingan...

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.600
Could we please stop this childish game of hide and seek, Mr.Kakashi?!

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.330
I suppose we could...

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.270
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.370
I get it! Awesome, Kakashi Sensei!

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.170
The Fireball Jutsu...

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.170
But I noticed earlier, something's off...

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.130
Don't tell me, Kakashi Sensei... is under his Genjutsu?!

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.500
Just as I'd expect... You sure know how to use a Jutsu...

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.170
Since you hid yourself temporarily using the Earth Style,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.530
I didn't notice in time...

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:57.370
No wonder... my Genjutsu's having no effect.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.170
This is a Shadow Clone.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.800
He's fast...!

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.000
Is that...?

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.230
Yeah...

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.570
Game over!

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.330
Asakujaku!

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.830
Looks like it's over...

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.670
Take him out, my Shadow Clone and all, Naruto!

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.700
- I know! - I know!

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.830
Huh? Improve my Rasengan?

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.370
That's right...

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.230
I can already use the Rasengan well enough!

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.930
More importantly, teach me some new Jutsu!

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.930
Listen, you...

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.830
Do you think the Rasengan you use now is good enough...?

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.270
Think back to when you fought

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.130
that four-eyed guy who was with Orochimaru.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.170
I don't know what kind of Jutsu you've learned.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.700
But you can't hit me with that large of a motion.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.870
This won't work... It's too tough to hit a moving target...

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.700
And then what did you do next?!

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.770
You won't get away now...

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.730
Are you going to get your hand cut open

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.670
each time you face off against an enemy?

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.770
That's exactly why I need a new Jutsu!

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.600
Are you being serious?

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.330
Don't tell me you've forgotten?

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:52.170
The Rasengan is a Jutsu the Fourth Hokage left behind for us!

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:56.000
Oh...Uh... Well... I haven't forgotten it or anything...

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.900
Fair enough.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.030
The Rasengan is a Jutsu completed by the Fourth Hokage.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.770
Now you should try to make it your own.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.200
Improve the Rasengan and make it into your own original Jutsu.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.270
Huh?!

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.900
My own original Jutsu...

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:21.500
That's right.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.630
Use that massive Chakra of yours

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.270
to make the Rasengan easier to hit an enemy with.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.070
It'll be a Jutsu possible only through that massive Chakra.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.300
It'll be your own original Rasengan!

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.070
My own original Rasengan!

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.200
And in order to improve the power of the Rasengan,

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.970
you need to build up much more Chakra.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.970
The training will once again be rough!

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:54.130
But if you complete it, it will become your strongest weapon.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.900
We'll call it...

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.430
- Giant...Rasengan! - Giant...Rasengan!

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.670
A-Amazing...!

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.030
Ooh... He's...!

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:32.000
What...was up with that smile?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.070
I do get the feeling I fought him somewhere before, but...

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.300
You really don't remember?

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.830
It looked like he knew a lot about you, Guy Sensei...

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.230
What's going on...?

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.000
H-He's...

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.400
Wh-What's this...?

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.470
While we were fighting, I felt like something wasn't right...

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.470
What do you mean?!

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.270
It's one of...their Jutsu or something...

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:28.730
He's...

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.530
What is this? What in the world does this mean?

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.670
I don't know...

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.200
But...there's one thing I can say...

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.370
I don't know this man, after all!

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.770
Do you know him...?

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:54.500
Yes...

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.570
It's Yura... He's a Jonin from our village...

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.600
Seeking the truth always involves putting one's life at risk.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:44.970
As we pursued mystery, the desert's blazing sun, sand storms

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.900
and poisonous scorpions awaited us.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.530
However, we will end up reforming the darkness of history.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.470
Secrets about the statue beyond our imagination will now be revealed!

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.530
It's on next!

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.700
"Pursue romance in the Shinobi world,

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.400
mysterious lands, and the mystery of the giant statue!"

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.230
That's just a statue of the previous Kazekage.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.000
Next episode: "The Secret of Jinchuriki"
