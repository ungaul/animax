00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.080
A mission to find a wedding present, huh?

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.380
The Hokage is giving us a wonderful opportunity to find a great gift…

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.080
…that personifies our friendship.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.330
That's right, we've never had a wedding celebration like this.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.000
– Well, they are the first – Hey, Shino! Cut it out!

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.330
– among all our friends – I didn't say anything until now,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.000
– to get married. – but I've had enough of

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.330
– We gotta do our best to find – your insect antics!

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.210
– something they'll both like. – Hey, Akamaru!

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.380
Me too! I'm getting fired up!

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.710
I'm gonna make sure they definitely love my gift!

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.250
Do you know what you're getting already, Lee?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.630
I haven't a clue.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.880
Huh?!

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.420
However! If I put myself in Naruto's shoes

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.170
and think about how he feels, I know it'll come to me naturally.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.250
I won't lose to anyone!

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.170
Wake up, Akamaru!

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.170
Usually, you don't compete with wedding gifts

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.920
to see who wins or loses…

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.290
Well then…

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.630
Let's give it our all!

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.460
This is for Hinata.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.380
Let's all put our best effort into this.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.880
There's no need to get so worked up.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.500
The reason is, if you just let it come naturally to you,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.210
you'll think of something.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.210
It seems everyone got really fired up about this.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.170
I can't think of anything.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.330
What about you, Choji?

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.140
I have a pretty good idea.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.020
Damn it… What a drag.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.690
IRUKA UMINO AROUND 30 YEARS OLD. STEALTHILY

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.860
A Full-Powered Wedding Gift ICHIRAKU

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.330
We're going to assess each gift and give it a ranking

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.870
to determine who will attend the wedding reception

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.170
and who will be placed on duty for that day's missions.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.460
In other words, we're going to sift and screen through the gifts.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.670
I'd better not mention any of that to anyone.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.470
Hello!

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.800
WELCOME Oh, it's Lee!

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.640
I'll have an order of the ramen Naruto orders most often!

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.020
Naruto's favorite ramen?

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.020
Let's see…

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.560
That's so obvious! It's our large miso and char siu ramen.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.480
– Oh, yeah that's right! – I see!

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.900
But why the sudden curiosity?

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.490
If I'm to understand Naruto's feelings,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.740
I figured I should first try the things he likes to eat.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.030
I don't get it but… anyways, take a seat.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.160
Okay!

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.580
Idiot…idiot…

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920
How is it?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.340
It's delicious! Light, yet rich, but not too heavy.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.920
It has volume and punch, and its impact is so great,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.050
you want to slurp it down all at once!

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.350
So…do you know how Naruto feels a little more now?

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.060
I understand why he always orders this ramen!

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.980
But other than that, no.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.730
I guess not.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.020
If you could tell how a guy feels just by eating ramen,

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.940
life wouldn't be so hard.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.070
Oh!

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.610
Iruka Sensei, you were Naruto's teacher.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.200
You must know.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.530
Iruka Sensei?!

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.830
I'm sorry, I was deep in thought and didn't notice you!

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.870
Don't worry.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.580
You're Lee, right? Guy Sensei's student.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.800
Yes! You were Naruto's teacher… So you must know how Naruto thinks.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.880
Please tell me about him!

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.880
Well, I was his teacher a long time ago.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.260
And he's become so praiseworthy now…

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.060
I only see him once in a while now…

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.020
I see…

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.980
But why are you trying to understand Naruto's feelings, Lee?

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.480
For his wedding gift.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.110
In order to find something he'll like,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.110
I thought I should first understand his feelings.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.660
I see, so that's it.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.780
In any case,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.200
in order to convey my intense regard for my friend Naruto,

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.450
I'm going to put my entire being into

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.040
THE BEST WEDDING GIFT! finding the best wedding gift for him!

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.170
Well then, please excuse me, Iruka Sensei!

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.550
He's exactly like Guy Sensei.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.630
I'm so sorry it was so loud!

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.100
Oh no. In fact, I'm happy that Naruto has a friend like him.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.850
Found ya, Iruka Sensei!

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.020
You didn't record your message yet!

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.360
That's right… Can you wait a little longer?

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.320
Not again…man.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.570
CHESTNUT SWEETS Naruto's wedding gift…

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.360
Naruto's wedding gift…

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.150
BATHS WOMEN MEN Naruto's wedding gift…

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.620
RIGHT OVER HERE… Naruto's…wedding…

NIKO NIKO DUMBBELL FAMILY

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.740
DUMBBELL FITNESS CLUB NOW OPEN

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.210
Yes!

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.040
How about dumbbells?!

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.210
Naruto! Hinata!

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.170
Congratulations on your marriage!

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.970
Please use these dumbbells and find everlasting happiness…

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.760
No, no, no, no, no! Stop!

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.180
Dumbbells are definitely useful.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.390
Its heaviness is surely symbolic of

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.140
the solidity and depth of my friendship…

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.520
And more importantly, they can make you stronger.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.600
Nothing else could better symbolize our friendship.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.060
But…

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.650
It's possible Naruto will get so hooked on muscle training

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.650
that he'll totally ignore Hinata…

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.280
Even if Naruto and I have a special bond,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.660
UNOFFICIAL LEAF VILLAGE MASCOT KONORIN giving him dumbbells might meet with some resistance.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.080
I must think of something else!

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.790
WEDDING GIFT WEDDING GIFT WEDDING GIFT WEDDING GIFT WEDDING GIFT WEDDING GIFT

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.460
Ahh! I can't think of anything!

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.550
During times like this—!

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.800
What gift would make Naruto and Hinata happy?

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.640
I guess it would be something that reminds them of me.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.770
Now if a kunai like this was specially ordered and made cute…

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.730
Marriage, huh? How nice…!

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.650
Hold on a sec!

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.950
One is in love with her dream man

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.570
and getting married, happily ever after.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.950
While I don't even have a boyfriend,

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.370
and train every day from morning until night…

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.790
This would be…

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.620
Kunai again?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.290
But it's Tenten, after all…

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.580
When you think of Tenten, you think kunai…

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.670
Maybe I should think of something else…

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.420
Get something that doesn't kill people,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.920
within the set budget

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.930
– that captures a maiden's heart… – Tenten!

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.300
– I need to ask you something! – That voice…

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.600
Idiot…idiot.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.730
Calm down when you ask people something.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:42.980
I'm sorry.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.360
I just couldn't do it by myself.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.730
I had no choice but to ask for your help and came looking for you…

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.150
But…I guess you're in a bind too.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.660
Uh-huh…

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.620
Sending the usual gift won't convey our feelings…

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.580
And yet, something that's more like me may not make them happy…

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.250
A wedding gift… is more complicated than I thought.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.630
What would Neji do?

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.760
We must not do that! We must go and investigate!

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.890
Investigate?

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.720
Yes!

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.480
NINJA TOOLS MANTENDO I get it. Rather than thinking alone,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.480
NINJA TOOLS MANTENDO looking at actual items can give us more ideas and variations.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.270
There are so many items,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.030
I'm sure we'll find something suitable that fits us,

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.610
while also making Naruto and Hinata happy!

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.700
You're right! For example… How about a sword like this?

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.330
Umm… It looks expensive,

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.580
but it doesn't have any connection to a wedding, does it?

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.580
No…

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.970
LONG LIFE They can use it for their first joint effort.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.640
LONG LIFE To cut the cake…that's all?

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.060
Not good?

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.600
Isn't a cake-cutter pretty low on the usefulness meter?

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.690
Then how about…

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.820
…this?

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.280
Tonfa?

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.400
It's totally you, since you're a taijutsu specialist…

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.280
That has no connection with a wedding either.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.580
No…

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.330
I figured it would be useful for everyday married life,

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.080
since they'll have more laundry to do…

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.620
For hanging laundry?!

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.750
Still, I don't think Naruto will be too pleased with this…

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.170
Maybe you should think of something a bit less strange.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.010
You're lucky, Tenten.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.640
All you have to do…

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.100
…is send this thing that you always use.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.140
Huh? Would getting kunai make them happy?

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.890
It's not necessary at all in married life.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.810
No! You can make full use of it!

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.240
It's perfect for newlyweds

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.700
FRIED PORK CUTLET who can't decide what to make for dinner!

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.950
FRIED PORK CUTLET Is that any way to use a kunai?!

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.830
Idiot…idiot.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.750
We didn't find a single thing.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.040
Let's try hard again tomorrow.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.380
I can't think of a single thing.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.340
Lee… Hey, Lee!

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.140
Neji!

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.600
When you get hooked on one thing,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.810
you even struggle with it in your dreams…

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.520
That's so like you, Lee.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.980
Neji… Is that really you, Neji?

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.150
You were groaning pretty loud.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.690
I couldn't find a gift for Naruto and Hinata's wedding.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.200
I spent the entire day looking,

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.410
but I've used up all my ideas and energy…

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.410
What about you, Neji?

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.370
I had one thing I had to tell you…

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.670
Neji, I'm… I know.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.960
Say no more.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.170
Lee, remember this carefully…

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.630
Physical strength over endurance!

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.880
Physical strength over endurance!

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.470
Physical strength over endurance?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.470
And don't forget…Hyuga.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.510
What? H-Hey wait, Neji!

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.310
I thought you appeared because I was

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.140
in such a dilemma about a wedding gift

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.980
and you wanted to give me advice!

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.360
Oh…

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.690
Neji!

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.730
Neji?!

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.240
RECORDING Naruto, Hinata, congratulations on your marriage.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.450
RECORDING Naruto, who would have expected a bad little kid

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.750
RECORDING would become such a great man?

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.620
RECORDING Hinata, please take care of Naruto.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.420
RECORDING I think that's it!

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.540
RECORDING Okay!

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.960
RECORDING It's perfect!

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.920
I can just see Big Brother Naruto's eyes welling up with tears!

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.470
Okay, I'm off to edit this! I can't wait!

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.890
Oh, Lee!

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.220
H-Hello, Iruka Sensei…

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.390
What happened to your face?!

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.060
I can't decide on a gift for Naruto's wedding…

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.570
On top of that, an old friend appeared in my dream

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.030
and gave me advice that doesn't make any sense at all and…

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.490
…I couldn't sleep thinking about it.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:09.040
2765 sheep, 2766 sheep, 2767 Neji, 2768—?

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.910
Neji, you jerk!

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.830
Oh, that sounds terrible…

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.170
At this rate, I'll never be able to convey

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.000
the depth of my friendship to Naruto!

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.260
There, there… Don't take it so seriously.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.050
UNOFFICIAL LEAF VILLAGE MASCOT KONORIN I'm sure it's a big struggle for you all…

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.640
But I'm very happy.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.890
Happy? Why?

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.140
I'm happy to know that a student I taught

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.940
has a friend who will go to such great lengths.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.150
Although, it may sound like

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.270
I'm just trying to make you feel better…

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.440
Oh, no such thing…

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.200
Actually, I've never had a chance

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.780
to talk like this to a friend of Naruto's.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.030
Thanks to his upcoming wedding,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.330
I got to talk to you and the others,

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:57.210
and you've shown me a valuable side of Naruto I never knew.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:58.920
I'm grateful for that.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.260
Now that I think about it, since he graduated,

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.680
you guys know much more about Naruto than I do.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.640
Is that so?!

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.390
Huh?

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.140
Why so shocked?

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.850
I thought I could ask for your help

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.900
HA HA HA HA HA with ideas for Naruto's wedding gift.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.860
HA HA HA HA HA Sorry, I'm no help.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.950
But considering the effort you're putting into finding a gift,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.530
I know Naruto will be happy, whatever you choose.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.280
Do you think so?

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.040
In fact, if he dares to complain, as his teacher,

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.950
I'll knock some sense into him all over again!

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.120
Did I sound pompous saying that?

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.830
As his teacher…knock some sense… all over again…

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:39.960
That's it!

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.750
Huh? What?

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.720
I had forgotten something very valuable!

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.340
Iruka Sensei, thank you!

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.010
Well then…

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.720
What was that?!

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.810
So you've come, Lee!

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.940
Guy Sensei!

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.320
I figured it would be around now.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.200
Judging from your expression, you're still in a dilemma, eh?

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.070
What? How can you tell?

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.410
One look at you and I can tell if you've been training all night

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.330
because something's bothering you.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.830
Guy Sensei!

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:21.540
And let me guess…your worries have to do with the wedding gift.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.630
Huh?!

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.210
G-Guy Sensei!

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.130
Can you read my heart?!

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.510
How long have we been together in the springtime of our youth?

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.890
Guy Sensei!

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.810
I can't even decide what to give Naruto for his wedding gift…

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.020
I'm still only half a shinobi!

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.390
Please knock some sense into me!

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.350
Well said, Lee!

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.690
Let's search together for a wedding gift!

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.950
– Guy Sensei! – Lee!

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.950
– Lee! – Guy Sensei!

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.830
Let's set up some rules before choosing a wedding gift.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.490
HOT-BLOODED First, it can't be something common.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.120
HOT-BLOODED But it mustn't be too unconventional.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.210
Yes, we figured out that much.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.960
It's from that point that we got stuck.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.210
And…the wedding gift should be one that leaves a lasting impression,

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.720
and conveys friendship, effort, and triumph in choosing it.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.640
So what would be a gift that personifies me…

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.810
and the hot springtime of youth—

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.310
…what would that be?

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.270
If it does exist, it would…

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.610
definitely include wearing a fashionable bodysuit!

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.320
Huh?! Why a bodysuit?

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.900
Yes! The hot spring of youth means sweat and tears!

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.280
Can sweat and tears be given as gifts?!

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.660
– No, of course not! – Just a minute, Lee!

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.830
In the first place, can man live on will power alone?!

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.120
Can he overcome the dangers of divorce with only patience?!

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.710
W-Wait, Sensei… You're going off the subject…

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.210
I've been thinking the same thing!

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.960
Should curry be medium-hot? Or super-spicy?!

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.170
Aw man! We're on totally different wave lengths!

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.050
A CHALLENGE All right! I'm going to do a handstand

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.130
A CHALLENGE and walk around the village 5,000 times!

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.970
A CHALLENGE Then I'll go 5,200 times!

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.800
A CHALLENGE Fine, then I'll go 5,300 times!

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.640
A CHALLENGE – 5,400 times! – 5,500 times!

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.970
A CHALLENGE Stop it!

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.940
It's true. We've gone way off the subject.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.610
So, let's just go back to the beginning.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:06.940
And go over the basics once more.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.150
Basics?

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.320
Yes.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.990
First of all, what is a wedding ceremony?

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.780
Th-That's a very philosophical question…

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.830
Uh, is that really where we're starting?

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.080
Then let me ask you this?

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
What is absolutely necessary for a wedding ceremony?

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.080
Wouldn't that be…love?

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.340
You are a poet.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.840
However, Lee… I think it's the bride and groom!

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.720
Oh! Y-Yes, there's no wedding without a bride and groom!

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.510
Right?

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.220
A wedding ceremony without a bride and groom

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.350
is not a wedding ceremony!

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.810
It's just a ceremony!

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.020
And by ceremony, who knows what kind of ceremony!

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.440
How blind I am!

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.860
Guy Sensei, you have the ability to see

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.280
what something is beneath the surface!

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.530
You are amazing!

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:53.900
You don't need to go overboard…

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.570
You have always been my role model…

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.370
– My everlasting hero! – No one's paying any attention.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.370
So now, we can think about what kind of gift

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.210
would please a bride and groom, right?

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.460
Exactly!

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.340
I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this…

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.090
All right! I'll be the groom.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.880
Lee, you are the bride!

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.970
Yes, Guy Sensei!

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.380
I knew it…

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.840
Why do I have to play the baby?

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.060
Not this again?

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.600
DUMPLINGS  Hi… I'm home.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:29.650
What time do you think it is?!

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.110
It's the new spring fashions!

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.690
– Move! – How cute!

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.030
– That's mine! – She took it!

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.200
Give it back!

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.570
How dare you!

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.030
Seventh Gate of Shock! Open!

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.830
– Damn it, – Well, Lee?

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.460
– what are you making me do? – Is something forming in your mind?

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.590
I think I'm almost there…

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.130
But after that, it's still far off… Well, never mind.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.890
You won't get an answer if you think too deeply.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.850
If Neji were here, he wouldn't even speak to you.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.270
No, but Neji would, if it's for Hinata's sake.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.350
The husband's female coworker appears out of nowhere

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.690
to threaten their peaceful family life.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.860
Neji would show up to take on that perfect role!

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.980
He would not!

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.280
Besides, how can you misinterpret Neji like that?!

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.740
Neji… Even if as a ghost, Neji would appear.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.280
Neji would appear?

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.500
Physical strength over endurance!

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.250
I see!

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.880
I get it.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.920
So that's it, Neji.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.130
So that was meant for Hinata, not me.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.470
What do you mean?

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.640
Physical strength is essential to protect a family!

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.600
– The highest form of strength! – Absolutely!

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.810
Cooking, washing, cleaning, raising the kids, shopping…

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.360
The newlywed life is a nonstop test of muscles!

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.610
Yes!

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.240
The newlyweds must prepare for that!

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.280
If that is so, there is only one answer!

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.990
The truest gift from us should be…

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.040
SPRINGTIME OF YOUTH – Dumbbells! – Dumbbells!

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.410
SPRINGTIME OF YOUTH You've got to be kidding!

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.870
– Guy Sensei… – Lee…

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.880
– Guy Sensei! – Lee!

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.880
Hah!

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.750
Lee! You shall present the left dumbbell!

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:17.300
Right!

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.920
And I'll present the right!

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.470
Let's go, Guy Sensei!

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.640
Yes! Our wedding gift… will lose to no one!

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.770
Okay, yeah… I'm gonna go with a custom-made kunai.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.810
I WILL RETURN TO RETRIEVE THIS LATER -MIGHT GUY

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.940
What, you fool!

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:38.820
ICHIRAKU Delivery?

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.860
– I see… – It's gonna take some time.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.990
– You've decided on a wedding gift? – Is that okay?

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.910
– Yes, and it's all thanks to – Okay, sorry.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.530
– Guy Sensei and you, Iruka Sensei. – Ayame is out right now.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.250
– It pays to have great mentors! – Is that okay? Thank you.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.410
– Well, if that's what you believe, – Thank you.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.080
– it makes me very happy. – What's your order?

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.880
What are you saying?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.880
Naruto is blessed to have a mentor like you, Iruka Sensei.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.550
I'm sure he feels the same way!

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.840
Oh, thank you.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.340
Okay, I'm going to take a look at some dumbbells.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:04.220
So if you'll excuse me!

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.600
Naruto's mentor, huh…?

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.850
I should find out more about how Naruto's grown

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.650
after leaving my care,

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:18.900
and what kind of bonds he's made with friends.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.780
If I'm truly Naruto's mentor… Oh! Iruka Sensei!

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.860
We meet again!

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.410
Konohamaru, just in time.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.660
That message I recorded last time… Can I do it over?

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.750
Sure. But why?

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.960
I want to find out more about Naruto,

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.460
and send him a proper message…

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.170
A message from his mentor…

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.130
I'm back!

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:43.680
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.840
What will you have?

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.050
Um…

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.810
I'll have the miso char siu. Make it a large.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.900
Coming right up.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.820
One large miso char siu ramen!

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:02.690
All right!

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.820
A large miso char siu ramen!

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.740
Miso?!

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.810
28 MORE DAYS UNTIL THE WEDDING

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:45.300
I can't think of a wedding gift! Choji, do you wanna think with me?

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:46.880
Besides that,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.010
do you get to eat sweets everyday of your sweet married life?

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.810
Like sweet bean curry, chocolate hamburger steak,

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.270
honey fried rice, tempura cake, and vanilla flavored food pills…

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.020
sounds so good…

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.020
