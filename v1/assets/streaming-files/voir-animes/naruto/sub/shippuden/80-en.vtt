WEBVTT

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.300
Suigetsu... I will release you from this place some day.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.370
I knew it was you...

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.330
The fact that you're here must mean you killed Orochimaru.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.170
Yeah.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.470
But never mind that. Let's get you out of here.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.930
Free at last. Thank you, Sasuke.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.030
Suigetsu, you're the first.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.900
Come with me.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.870
Me, first? There are others then?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.870
Two others. I'm taking Jugo from the northern hideout

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.130
and Karin from the southern hideout.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.170
Are you sure about that?

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.230
What is it?

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.330
It's nothing... Just that I don't like them.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.500
I can't get along with them... At least, that's what I think.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.030
Sure, you picked me,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.900
but I wonder about choosing those two, Sasuke.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.730
Enough with the rambling. Put on your clothes.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.300
We're going.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.330
Ordering me around like a big shot, eh?

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.930
Let me clarify the relationship between you and me...

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.730
All right?

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.370
Sorry, but you chose  to rescue me.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.530
I never said anything about following you.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.570
Just because you defeated Orochimaru doesn't make you better than me.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.100
Everyone was after him.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.870
You were Orochimaru's pet,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.970
so you weren't imprisoned and you stayed by his side.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.600
You had more chances to kill him than the rest of us.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.130
Gotcha... Just kidding.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.630
But I let you go just now, so that makes us even.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm free at last, so I'm going to do as I please.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.900
I see.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.800
That's unfortunate.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.070
By the way...

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.200
It was your team, wasn't it?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.100
The team that brought down my great predecessor, Zabuza Momochi.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.870
Whatever happened to his blade... the Executioner's Blade?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.170
Let's do this.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.900
If you tell me where the blade is, and I take possession of it,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.100
then I'll be willing to help you.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.730
Put some clothes on.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.630
Zabuza's Blade

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.370
GREAT NARUTO BRIDGE

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.030
The Great Naruto Bridge?

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.830
What a weird name...

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.470
Say, was the great Zabuza Senpai strong?

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.930
Everyone, duck!

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.570
It's over.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.970
I'm not that naïve!

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.770
Kakashi Sensei!

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.500
Damn it!

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.300
Guys like you aren't called "Ninja"...

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.870
Just mere kids.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.030
What's the matter, Sasuke?

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.570
Sasuke?

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.900
Nothing. Let's go.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:59.930
It's not here.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.800
Say, Sasuke, are you sure it was here?

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.170
Yeah.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.230
But it's not here. I wonder why?

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.470
How would I know? I'm not the keeper of that grave.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.800
If it's not there, someone must've taken it.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.800
You're right about that. It wouldn't have walked off on its own.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.200
Sasuke...

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.800
Sorry, but without the blade here, me joining you will have to wait.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.770
What'll you do then?

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.530
What else? I'm gonna look for it.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.730
The blade of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist was passed down

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.370
from generation to generation. That was the system.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.900
I aspired to become one of them and trained for it.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.570
Since Zabuza Senpai is gone...

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.900
I'm the one who should possess that Executioner's Blade.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.530
Watch where you're walking, you idiot!

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.230
Huh?

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.900
What? You have a problem, Bro?

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.630
Ah...whatever...

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.900
Just be careful!

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.000
What's his problem, stupid... jerk... old fart... idiot...?!

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.670
You're so nice, Sasuke...

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.270
So...how're you gonna settle this debt?

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.270
Oh...

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.330
This yogurt is the best.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.000
It's been so long since I had anything like this.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.700
I was in a water tank all this time.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.930
Can you afford to relax like this?

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.230
But...you're the one in a rush.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.900
Why're you gathering us together anyway?

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.800
I'll tell you when we've all assembled.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.170
"All right, let's go conquer this world!"

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.270
You're not gonna say something like that, are you?

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.330
Do that on your own time.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.500
I'm aiming for... something much bigger.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.700
If anyone else started saying that, I wouldn't believe it for a second.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.200
But with you...

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.170
I think maybe it's possible... And that's the strange thing.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.300
Oh say... The Great Naruto Bridge, was it?

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.100
Ever heard of a large blade near that bridge?

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.170
Well... Oh, maybe there was...

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.070
What about it?

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.070
He's looking for that blade.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.700
Huh?! S-Someone might know about it... I'll go and ask!

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.700
Oh dear!

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.070
SCREAMS

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.000
You're quite the ladies' man, eh?

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.970
I know!

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.900
- Tazuna... - Who lives by the riverside...

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.870
...would know!

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.270
Tazuna...huh?

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.800
Who is this Tazuna?

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.030
The carpenter boss who built that bridge.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.200
The boss isn't here right now.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.130
Do you know where he went?

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.400
To the Land of Lightning to build a bridge. He took Inari with him.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.470
He won't be back for another year.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.270
The Land of Lightning, eh? That's very far.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.630
Do you know of a large blade that was left near the Great Naruto Bridge?

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.400
Oh, that.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.630
Tenzen Daikoku took it.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.730
He originally came here to capture the Ninja who wielded the blade.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.970
But after learning the Ninja was dead, he took the blade with him instead.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.430
Damn it... Tenzen Daikoku, eh?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.070
He was the aide to the lord of the Land of Water.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.500
Apparently, many of his men were killed

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.400
during Zabuza Senpai's coup d'état in the Hidden Mist.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.600
I guess he had a grudge from back then.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.200
Where the hell... do you think you're--?!

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.470
Hey, we were just looking for you.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.030
Wh-Who are you guys?!

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.200
You seem like the type to know all kinds of things...

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.130
I know nothing about Tenzen!

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.300
Anything will do. Just tell us what you know.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.400
T-Tenzen Daikoku is a politician...

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.970
But there's another side to him.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.770
He's the boss of a huge band of thieves.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.370
I hear he doles out huge bribes to the feudal lords,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.530
and gets to do whatever evil things he likes.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.800
See, you know it all. And? Where does he live?

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.370
Just to the south... there's a castle in the forest.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:06.530
Rumor says several thousand mercenaries guard the place and that it's impenetrable.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.970
Wh-Who's there? How did you get in?!

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.700
The day after tomorrow,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.230
this castle will be attacked by tens of thousands of soldiers.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.600
Make sure you gather every man available.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.530
My name...is Suigetsu.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.330
An intruder! Men! Come out!

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.370
Cripes... What's going on?

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.000
It seems another powerful clan plans to attack Tenzen's castle tomorrow

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.630
with an army that numbers in the tens of thousands.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.430
Oh... is that true?

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.830
Oh well, whatever.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.430
The more confused the enemy becomes, the better my chances.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.400
Be it several thousand or tens of thousands,

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.730
it doesn't matter to a Ninja like me.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.130
I'll sneak in tonight and take the Executioner's Blade.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.670
How about making a wager?

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.430
A wager...?

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.000
On who gets the Executioner's Blade first...

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.100
Huh?! I never expected you to have a playful side!

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.700
Let's do it. It sounds like fun.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.070
Then it starts now.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.470
There's only one rule. We don't kill anyone.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:48.770
Huh?

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.670
Who the hell are you?!

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.300
You're suspicious!

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.470
You mean... Now as in...?

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.270
It really starts now, huh?

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.170
I can't lose this wager. Well, all right, let's do it.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.970
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.070
Gotta hand it to you, Sasuke!

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.000
What the--?! He's gone?!

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.070
Is this for real?!

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.070
Damn, may as well get started!

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.630
This is tiring, after all.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:02.530
Finally, my goal.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:08.400
Impossible... You defeated all those men by yourself?!

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:13.330
Well yeah. Even with legitimate weapons, attacking me is useless.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.670
If legitimate weapons are of no use...!

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.800
How about...this?!

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.900
Say, that's my Executioner's Blade.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.470
Ah, you did it!

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.430
You let down your guard at the very end.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.170
Sorry. Blades don't work on me...

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.300
You see?

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.430
But I'm jealous.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.370
You're able to wield that blade without any special training...

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.300
It helps when you have a good physique.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.400
I hear you've been telling everyone in town...

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.500
That you killed the Demon Zabuza and took that blade from him.

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:13.870
Th-That wasn't me... It was Lord Tenzen who...

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.830
Hmm... So you killed Zabuza Senpai?

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.570
N-No... The one who killed Zabuza was...

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.100
Zabuza?

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:28.370
Err...no! The one who killed Mr. Zabuza wasn't me...

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.470
You're...the one...from yesterday!

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.530
He's the one! He's the one who killed Mr. Zabuza!

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.130
All I did was bring the blade back from the grave!

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.330
I'll give you some points for that.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:52.100
That's a pretty good lie for a villain like you to come up with.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.170
Suigetsu!

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.670
How thoughtful. I was feeling a bit dehydrated.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.400
I think you're under the wrong impression here.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.030
I wasn't particularly close to Mr. Zabuza.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.270
But the thought of my Senpai from my village...

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:26.470
...having such pathetic rumors about losing to weaklings like you is...

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.470
You know...?

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.000
D-Do you think you can get away with this?!

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.800
Well, you'll have to pay for this...right?

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.330
I think I'll test it on you.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.330
Forget it. What's the sense in killing someone like him?

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.370
I've cut through the main pillars, so you'd better get out of here.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.800
I'll spare your life.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.270
Out of respect for you, Sasuke.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.300
Sasuke? Not that...?!

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.130
Sasuke who killed Orochimaru?!

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:16.600
Say, you're famous. They know your name even around here.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.530
As long as I have this blade, I won't even lose to you...maybe.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:40.900
Say... You knew that I was going to claim this blade, didn't you?

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.830
And...You knew from the start that the blade wasn't in that grave...

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.630
I see...

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.600
The one who warned that castle to gather its men...

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.170
was you?

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.770
Tenzen acted like he'd met you before.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:05.030
Hey? Did you suggest a wager just to lure me into enemy territory?

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.630
Were you just testing me?

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.430
Man, you're terrible. What if I was hurt?

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.730
Well, I understand now... what kind of guy you are.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.870
And you're exactly the way I imagined you to be.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.500
Anyway, I have my blade. So I'll help you as promised.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.570
So? Which way do we go? Oh wait...

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:38.170
The nearest route, right? That would be your answer.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.630
I'm starting to figure you out...

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.500
Right, the nearest route.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.600
Just because Orochimaru is dead doesn't mean

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.530
I'll let you have your way!

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.130
The feeling of this Chakra... I-It can't be...

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.870
Say... Why are you gathering men?

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.000
I have a goal...

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.000
And I have a better chance of achieving it with a small team.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.870
But still, I don't know about choosing Karin...

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.900
Unlike me, she's a follower of Orochimaru.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.900
Not to mention her personality...

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.970
But, her power is special...

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.200
Well... That I'll have to agree with you on.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:05.170
Next time: "Guardian of the Iron Wall"

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.500
Tune in again!
