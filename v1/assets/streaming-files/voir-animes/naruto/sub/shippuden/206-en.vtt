WEBVTT

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.860
Tailed Beast Counting Song! All right, here we go!

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.110
One, "sleep is better than humans," says Shukaku.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.610
ONE TAIL SHUKAKU / GAARA One, "sleep is better than humans," says Shukaku.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.150

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.530
THREE TAIL ISOBU / YAGURA Three, leave the water to Isobu.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.110

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.480
FIVE TAIL KOKUO / HAN Five, always on the run, Kokuo.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.110
Six, taking it easy and not in a hurry, Saiken.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.530
SIX TAIL SAIKEN / UTAKATA Six, taking it easy and not in a hurry, Saiken.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.070
Seven, the flying leaf insect, Chomei.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.570
SEVEN TAIL CHOMEI / FU Seven, the flying leaf insect, Chomei.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.030
Eight, "Yeah!" is all it needs, Gyuki.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.440
EIGHT TAIL GYUKI / KILLER BEE Eight, "Yeah!" is all it needs, Gyuki.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.070
Nine, "ko-kon" cries the mighty Kurama.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.400
NINE TAIL KURAMA / NARUTO UZUMAKI Nine, "ko-kon" cries the mighty Kurama.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.480
All the Tailed Beasts have finally come together.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.610
They're a little hard, but they're nice names.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.400
They're all splendid names.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.440
They're all wonderful names.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.690
Next up, the Jinchuriki! Here we go!

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.400
GAARA One, with terrible bags under his eyes, Gaara.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.480
YUGITO NI'I Two, with a silky voice like a cat, Yugito.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.610
YAGURA Three, the Fourth Mizukage, Yagura.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.400
ROSHI Four, together for forty years, Four Tails and Roshi.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.400
HAN Five, tough and powerful, Han.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.480
UTAKATA Six, reserved and dressed in a kimono, Utakata.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.570
FU Seven, the heart-warming kunoichi, Fu.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.400
KILLER BEE Eight, he's got crazy rap skills, Killer Bee.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.440
NARUTO UZUMAKI Nine, the Leaf's Naruto Uzumaki.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.400
All the powerful Jinchuriki have finally come together.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.780
Can they become friends with the Tailed Beasts?

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.440
They're all splendid shinobi.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.570
They're all wonderful shinobi.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.410
The Promise of Victory

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.700
– Heave…ho! – Heave…ho!

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.870
Hey, did you hear?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.080
What?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.580
Rumor is that Madara appeared at the other battlefields.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.910
Madara?

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.620
We're at war with him, so that's nothing unusual.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.780
No! I'm not talking about that shady-looking masked Madara.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.660
They're saying the real one appeared!

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.200
What?!

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.240
What do you mean, "real one"?

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.410
Are you saying, that all this time, he's been a fake?

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.580
No, what I mean is… A super strong one,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.240
just like the real Madara Uchiha has appeared!

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.200
And he's strong enough to take on the Five Kage.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.200
Take on the Five Kage?

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.080
Give me a break.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.580
It's true!

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.280
From what I heard,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.780
he hurled down meteorites and created a jungle instantly.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.910
Above all, he's a giant… tens of meters tall.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.080
A giant?!

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.740
Well, they're just rumors… Will you two cut it out?!

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.200
Sure, the enemy's numbers have dwindled.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
But we need to hunt down the remaining enemy.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.200
We're on a mission here.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.620
Get serious!

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.370
Focus on the enemy, here and now!

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.160
S-Sorry…

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.660
You're right!

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.240
We weren't able to show our stuff at this battle.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.200
We'll show 'em on the next battlefield!

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.080
Okay.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.160
I'll pursue the enemy on the left!

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.950
You guys go to the right and stop any remnants there!

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.080
Roger!

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.490
– Let's go! – Yeah!

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.240
Another one bites the dust.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.200
Hey! I'm the one that got him!

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.950
What? Trying to take all the credit?

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.780
Well, all you did was use a little jutsu at the very end!

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.200
And that's what did him in!

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.950
Fine, I'll give you that…

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.080
But catching one weakling is nothing to brag about.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.200
Yeah…

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.280
Eight Trigrams: Air Palm!

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.910
Watch out, you two!

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.200
Are you all right?!

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.330
You saved us…

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.370
The battle here finally ended.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.410
If we were to get killed when it was all over…

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.740
We were about to be humiliated…

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.410
The next battle is going to be on the front lines.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.910
SHINOBI

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.450
The Five Kage are holding back Madara.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Sending Kakashi and Guy out ahead

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.200
seems to have worked.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.280
However, Naruto and the others on the front line

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.410
are under pressure.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.200
Once the other battles wind down, they'll rush to lend support.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.910
Are you all right?!

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.830
Y-Yes… I'm sorry.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.370
Compared to the others fighting on the battlefield,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.200
I have it easy, and yet…

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.530
No. We have our own kind of tension that we have to contend with here.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.280
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.200
This is a critical time for us.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.280
I'm okay!

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.450
All right. Thanks.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.410
Listen up, everyone!

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.410
The war is entering its final stage!

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.830
We are the central command center for every company.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.280
We cannot afford to make a single mistake!

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.700
I can't tell you not to overdo it.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.910
But hang in there a bit longer and do your best!

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.330
I'm counting on you!

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.200
There isn't a man in the Sensory Unit

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.490
who'd throw in the towel with something like this!

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.580
Right, guys?!

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.830
– Right! – Right!

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.280
Neither would we!

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.240
That goes for us too!

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.120
Right, Captain Inoichi?!

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.990
Let's show 'em that the Communications Unit is tireless!

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.990
Hmm…

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.660
Right…

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.120
But if you get tired, I'll take over…

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.620
so it's okay to rest a bit.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.910
Huh?! Don't take it easy on us!

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.700
Just tell us to follow you!

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.620
You have to learn to go with the flow!

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.410
Sorry… I'm not good at that kind of stuff.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.410
That erased the pent-up anxiety everyone was feeling…

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.580
and a sense of unity was born at Headquarters.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.910
Headquarters, each battle company,

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.370
and Naruto and the others fighting on the front lines.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.280
If we can stand united in purpose,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.280
our foundation will be unshakeable and we can overcome this war.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.950
Th-This is…?!

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.370
What happened?

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.160
– Tailed Beast Bomb! – Tailed Beast Bomb!

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.560
The front line at last…

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.770
Just you wait! I'll show you my stuff!

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.390
Huh?! What is that?

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.980
What's happening?!

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.310
Isn't that in the direction of the front line?

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.180
Huh? L-Look over there.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.480
Is that where we're going?

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.100
Yes…

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.310
That talk earlier about Madara…

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.180
Maybe they weren't just rumors.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.430
That looks like…

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.390
something huge… Yeah… Here's our chance to show 'em.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.480
Well done, Naruto!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.680
I never thought you’d be able to completely control Nine Tails.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.480
However, it looks like you still can’t maintain it for too long.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.140
So same old, same old.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.640
It's not the same old, same old…

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.600
I just learned a whole bunch of hard names all at once!

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.730
Difficult names?

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.980
What does that have to do with anything?

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.560
You don't know, do you?!

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.140
I'm not gonna tell you!

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.270
Naruto gaining such experience and strength

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.100
makes me feel old and feeble.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.810
What's the matter?

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.930
You're not being yourself!

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.730
It may sound funny coming from me…

00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.480
The springtime of our youth is still far from over!

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.430
We still have a lot of…

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.020
Quiet! Do you want to make me feel even worse?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.270
That's the Guy I know!

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.730
That expression…

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.140
Huh? Am I sweating?

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.230
No, it's just rain.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.430
These fools could never make me sweat.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.600
Naruto was always merely a pawn to test Sasuke.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.270
That brat's supposed to be an amusement.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.810
I knew what his limits were.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.230
There's no way his power could be pushing me this hard.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.060
So what is it?!

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.270
What's happened?

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.430
It doesn't matter.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.230
It doesn't matter who or what Naruto is now…

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.140
After this war is over,

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.560
there will be no past or future.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.180
Nothing that exists now will matter then!

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.270
A-Amazing…

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.640
Did you guys feel that?

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.810
I can't believe it.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.100
There's no doubt. That is the Nine Tails' power!

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.230
Yeah…

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.430
But I sense something… slightly different.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.180
What's the current situation?

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.180
Naruto Uzumaki is holding back the Masked Madara

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.230
with an unbelievable amount of power.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.060
The chakra is unbelievable!

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.430
He's keeping him at bay.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.890
It's just the four of them! Naruto, Lord Bee, Kakashi and Guy!

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.310
Inoichi!

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.390
Relay Naruto's actions directly into the minds

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.100
of the reinforcement troops with everything you've got!

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.770
Fifteen seconds is all we need!

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.270
I want to boost everyone's morale all at once!

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.520
Those four are giving it their all!

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.980
I want the rest of us here to do everything we can too.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.430
Convey their resolve to everyone!

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.100
To everyone?!

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.180
It will overload the Chakra Network.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.730
Make one mistake and…

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.230
You ask for the extreme.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.230
Make it ten seconds!

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.430
Master Inoichi!

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.770
Sorry, but this is critical!

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.350
Make it short, but make it count!

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.600
I'm not good with words, but you can count on me!

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.140
Message from HQ!

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.140
We have the upper hand at the battle reinforcement point!

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.980
Naruto Uzumaki is standing firm!

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.140
The ones we must protect at all costs, Naruto and Lord Bee…

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.600
are fighting with everything they've got on the front line!

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.020
Guy and Kakashi are there too!

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.640
To everyone in the Allied Force…

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.810
I need all of you to add to their mighty hearts!

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.680
Amplify it with your mighty hearts!

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.270
I promise you, victory is now!

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.310
I'm bad with words, after all.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.020
It took me 20 seconds.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.100
Captain…

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.310
Yeah…

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.730
That just shows how mighty your heart is…

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.140
Sorry…

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.230
Naruto…

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:12.890
I've run, and run after you my whole life.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.230
And I'm still running after you.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.270
But when this war is over.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.100
I'm going to stop running.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.930
I'll stand with you. I'll hold your hand.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.180
And I'll walk with you by your side.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.140
So please wait for me!

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:50.310
Naruto… I marked you as my rival ages ago.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.390
Hang tight against Madara, until I get there!

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.350
I'll support you completely with my ninjutsu, Naruto.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.600
And a reason… is not necessary!

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.350
Naruto is doing a good job.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.310
I can't see him being anything other than reckless.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.850
But despite his looks, he's a pretty sharp guy.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.430
People thought Naruto was dumb and I was fat.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.640
But that really wasn't the case!

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.640
Wait for me, smart Naruto!

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.890
Skinny Choji is coming to help you!

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.230
He's not the type to strategize calmly.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.430
That's what I'm here for.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.930
So you just wait, Naruto. I'll be right there!

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.770
Thank you, Dad!

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.810
You transmitted Naruto's mighty heart to everyone.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.810
That promise must be fulfilled!

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.140
I wonder if Guy Sensei is all right?!

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.020
I hope he's protecting Naruto!

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.230
Kakashi Sensei is there too.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.180
I think they'll manage, but…

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:07.680
If it wasn't raining,

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.930
we could have flown on my Super Beast Scrolls.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.180
Stop complaining, Sai. Pick up your speed!

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.640
We must follow Master Guy and Naruto's examples.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.730
This is the time for us to exceed ourselves!

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:20.350
Uh-huh…

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.430
This is camaraderie…

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.100
I have a really good grasp of it now, Naruto.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.560
Naruto…

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.230
You saved the Hidden Leaf.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.310
And now, you are trying to save the shinobi world.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.640
And we've always, always put the burden on your shoulders.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.230
But this time, no matter what you say…

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.390
you'll have help.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.890
Not just me.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.230
This time, we'll all fight together!

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.540
We should find Sasuke before we get mixed up in this war!

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.330
Suigetsu, why are you here?

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.960
Are you in Team Hawk just to cause trouble with Sasuke and Karin.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.250
I would love to break those two losers up for good!

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.830
I can't help it!

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.710
You're reprehensible, you know that?

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.080
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Eyes That See in the Dark"

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.710
I hate you all.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.830
EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.630
Tune in again!
