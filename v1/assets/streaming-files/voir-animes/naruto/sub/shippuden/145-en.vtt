WEBVTT

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.370
Danzo Shimura

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.670
I guess this is the extent of Sasuke’s power.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.400
You were too hasty. My eye is still open.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.500
Go to Itachi so he can lecture you.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.170
I win.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.170
What's going on?!

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.030
This feels like…

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.470
You may think you've seen through Izanagi…

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.930
What is the meaning of this?

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.230
Why won’t Izanagi activate?

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.100
Danzo, as you said,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.270
Sasuke's genjutsu is a far cry from Itachi’s.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.700
You insolent…

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.800
You're the one who's going to see Itachi.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.830
Just as I thought, this one is the real Danzo!

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.470
It’s a far cry from Itachi’s Tsukuyomi,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.170
in which he freely manipulated time within a genjutsu.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.600
But the trick lies in how you use

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.370
even a short, weak genjutsu.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.900
With Izanagi, a Sharingan is cast away once its use is exhausted.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.400
One eye will keep the jutsu active for 60 seconds.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.730
However… Y-You fool! Why are you engaging him?

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.130
It may have seemed suicidal,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.400
but Sasuke's relentless attacks were intended to

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.400
to completely shut down Danzo's Sharingan one by one.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.500
He knew exactly what he was doing.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.070
That is why… just before they exchanged blows,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.330
every Sharingan on his right arm had already shut.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.800
Sasuke is an Uchiha.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.000
And he is a ninja who possesses the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.670
His skills of observation, Danzo, are keener than yours.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.170
In an instant, before you were even aware,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.500
Sasuke placed a genjutsu on you and made you believe

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.600
that the last eye on your right arm was still open.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.300
You yourself were concerned

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.130
about the instability of the Izanagi’s duration

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.300
and kept checking the Sharingan on your right arm.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.000
Sasuke did not miss that.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.430
Very subtly, he wanted to make you think

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.100
the Izanagi would last a little longer.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.500
He had already confirmed that he could place you under genjutsu,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.630
even if it was just for an instant.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.930
And Sasuke seized that opportunity.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.370
Because you also possess the Sharingan,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.500
you underestimated how to use it in battle.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.730
Your arrogance led to your defeat.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.000
Now that’s battling with your eyes.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.270
Don't underestimate the Uchiha.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.830
Danzo didn't get to use Shisui's eye,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.830
but you pressed him into a corner, Sasuke.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.870
Looks like I’ll be able to take Shisui’s eye soon.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.300
The Foundation should have stayed hidden underground.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.400
Sasuke!

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.000
Are you all right?

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.730
Hurry up and bite!

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.330
Bringing that woman was a wise decision.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.900
She's useful.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.200
I see why Sasuke chose her.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.670
How could I…of all people… lose to this brat?!

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.130
I can’t die here yet!

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.430
No, at this rate, I’ll be taken over by the First Hokage’s cells!

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.230
He's near death and he’s losing the ability to control chakra.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.530
Hashirama's power is not easy to control.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.930
What a persistent guy!

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.370
Not yet…

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.530
This is where we battle with our eyes.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.800
The visual prowess in his right eye has returned.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:27.430
I see. He intended to use Izanagi until Shisui's eye recuperated.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600
Shisui's visual prowess…

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.900
He's trying to decide whether to use it for genjutsu,

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.700
or sacrifice it for the Izanagi.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.970
You used your visual prowess too much, didn’t you?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.670
Sasuke…

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.430
Sasuke is no longer useful.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.100
As I thought, Madara’s the one I need to place

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.530
under genjutsu and manipulate.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.270
I can’t waste time, my wound is deep.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.630
Now then, Sasuke. What will you do?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.470
Isn't it ironic that you, who glorified self-sacrifice,

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.230
would take a hostage?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.270
It's not that I consider my life precious.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.430
But for the sake of Hidden Leaf Village… for the ninja world…

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.930
I cannot afford to die here.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.530
No matter what the means, I must survive.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:44.870
For I will be the one reformer who will change this ninja world.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.070
This woman will be sacrificed for that cause.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.470
Sasuke help!

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.030
Don't move…Karin.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.870
A vital point… Right through the hostage!

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.300
That’s what I wanted to see.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.430
Brother… One down.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.730
You didn't have time to cast Izanagi, did you, Danzo?

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.200
Sasuke… What was I…

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.670
…to you?

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:52.700
Karin…

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.400
Since you managed to get taken hostage,

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.900
you’re nothing but a burden to me.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.430
Sasuke…

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.870
Danzo…

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.330
I'm taking Shisui's eye.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.600
Is Itachi here?

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.530
We need to talk, come out!

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.730
What brings you all here?

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.370
There were two people who didn’t show up at yesterday’s assembly.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.430
Why didn’t you come?

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.630
We understand that joining the Anbu Black Ops means

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.400
being pushed to do all sorts of petty assignments.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.000
Your father has said as much and tries to defend you.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.530
But we have no intention of giving you special treatment.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.000
I understand. I shall be more careful hereafter.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.030
Now, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.800
All right.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.500
But before that,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.830
we’d like to ask you a bit more about something.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.900
It’s about Shisui Uchiha who died

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.430
after throwing himself into the Nakano River last night.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.130
He took Shisui's eye?

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.070
Are you all right, Danzo?

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.770
Why'd you interfere, Hiruzen?!

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.170
Don't say that.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.700
We don't want to lose comrades in a situation like this.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.730
You're alive!

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.400
Kagami! Torifu!

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.570
Yeah, I managed somehow.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.570
There are too many of them. What'll we do, Hiruzen?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.230
Yeah, you're right.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.870
We should meet up with the Second Hokage.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.900
We're surrounded.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.370
There are…

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.430
20 of them.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.130
Judging from their tracking skills,

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.530
I'd say they're from the Hidden Cloud.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.830
The highly skilled Kinkaku Unit.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.930
There are seven of us including you, Lord Hokage.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.500
We're completely outnumbered.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.800
Homura! Don't be such a coward.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.800
The enemy hasn't pinpointed our position yet.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.630
We should lie in wait until we can find an opportunity to break through.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.370
It's no use, Koharu.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.900
One of us will have to divert their attention.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.470
A decoy?

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.700
It means certain death.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.630
So who?

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.570
I am a shinobi.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.930
I’ve made up my mind to die on the battlefield like a proper shinobi.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.330
Sarutobi…

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.400
What are you thinking now?

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.930
Are you prepared to make that sacrifice?

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.170
Go ahead! Say it! That I’ll…

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.000
What's the matter?

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.830
Why can't I say it?

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.830
I will go!

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.200
Sarutobi… Hiruzen, you…

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.330
Don't worry!

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.500
I may not look it, but I know I’m better than any of you.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:40.970
I won't die.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.970
My trembling…stopped.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.130
Damn it! I'm such a coward.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.530
Somewhere deep inside my heart,

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.100
I feel relieved.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.570
Look after the others, Danzo. I know you’ll—

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.670
Shut up! I was planning on volunteering!

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.630
Don't try to steal the spotlight! I'll be the decoy!

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.600
Danzo…

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.470
My father and grandfather both died on the battlefield as shinobi.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.930
Self-sacrifice is a shinobi's duty!

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.700
No, I will go and be the decoy, of course.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.930
You all are the young Wills of Fire that

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.630
will be defending our village in the future.

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.600
No! You are the Hokage!

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.330
There is no greater shinobi in the village than you!

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.770
Danzo, you are always competing with Saru over one thing or another,

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.530
but what's necessary here

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.400
is for you to unite and work together as comrades.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.470
Do not make this a personal fight.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.400
The fact is, you took too long to reach a decision.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.730
You must first look at yourself rationally and know yourself.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.600
Otherwise, at this rate, you will place your comrades in danger.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.570
In any case, Danzo and Saru…

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.400
You two are still young, so don't be hasty.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.630
Your time will come.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.200
Until that time, stay alive.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Saru…

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.430
Protect those who love the village and those who believe in you.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:24.370
And nurture those to whom you can entrust the next generation.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.270
Starting tomorrow, you are the Hokage!

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.730
Saru… Take care of the Hidden Leaf!

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.000
Yes, sir!

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.870
You always get ahead of me!

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.870
For the sake of the ninja world… for sake of the Hidden Leaf…

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.770
I will not let you both live!

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.000
This is the Reverse Tetragram Sealing Jutsu.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.900
Sasuke!

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.570
Get away from Danzo!

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:17.930
Hiruzen, it's my turn next.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.130
Where the tree leaves dance, one shall find flames.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.400
The fire’s shadow will illuminate the village.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.600
And once again tree leaves shall bud anew.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:43.000
Just as you gave your life to protect the Hidden Leaf.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.430
This time, I will.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.100
I cannot allow these men…

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.770
But in the end, I could not become the Hokage.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:07.230
No matter how far I ran, I could never catch up to you.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.030
You were a tree leaf upon which light shone.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.100
I was nothing but a foundation hidden in darkness.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.600
What do you think of someone like me?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.330
Hiruzen…

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.230
What was I to you?

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.700
I wonder when I started liking Sasuke.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:46.070
I never thought about who he really was behind that pensive face.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.730
I’m sorry Naruto, I let you bear the burden all on your own.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.900
But also, thank you!

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.900
I already decided!

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.300
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: “Sakura’s Resolve”

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.530
I hope I get there in time!

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.270
Tune in again!
