00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.270
Tenchi Bridge

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.500
I don't sense the presence of anyone around the Tenchi Bridge...

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.430
I guess that means there won't be any Akatsuki ambush, huh...?

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.000
All right! Then let's proceed as planned.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.070
Right!

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.530
Naruto.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.370
Could you take this and hold it towards me?

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.530
All right, that's good. Hold it towards me.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.770
Wood Style: Transformation!

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.830
So? Did it turn out okay?

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.070
Yes, it did!

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.270
You look like Sasori's puppet Hiruko in every way.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.830
Now I want to adjust the voice. Let me know when it sounds right.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.700
Yes, sir!

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.630
Oh! That's it. That's the voice.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.930
Then we're going to start the operation, okay?

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.530
Your tone is too polite.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.930
You need to sound more violent or surly or something...

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.870
Oh...That's right.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.170
I'm irritable, and hate waiting and being kept waiting.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.730
Okay, we're starting the operation!

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.300
Right-right. That's what he was like!

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.230
Okay, our opponent should be on the alert. We'll split up now!

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.170
Observe teamwork at all times! Especially you, Naruto!

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.730
Don't be jumping out before I give the signal!

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.800
Let's go!

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.930
Okay...Time to go.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.570
The wind's strong. This should...

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.470
Sakura...

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.430
Yeah, this spot should be okay.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.470
It's almost noon...

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.970
That spy jerk...isn't he here yet?

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.730
Is that him?

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.230
The Tenchi Bridge 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.670
Here he comes.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.400
At midday in ten days, go to the Tenchi Bridge

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.300
located in the Village Hidden in the Grass!

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.870
I've got a spy working as one of Orochimaru's subordinates...

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:12.830
I was supposed to rendezvous...with him...there...

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.500
That's him, huh...?

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.870
Captain Yamato... I hope you do okay...

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.970
It's been a long time, Lord Sasori.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.570
He's...

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.400
It's been five years, hasn't it?

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.530
Kabuto Yakushi...

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.030
Were you followed...?

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.930
We're okay...

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.800
How're you doing?

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.230
I've still got the strange sensation...

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:32.630
from when I remembered who I was after your Jutsu broke...

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.000
I still feel heavy-headed...

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.170
Him again...?!

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.770
Who would've thought... the Akatsuki spy was Kabuto.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.370
I've got some questions for you.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.670
I don't have much time, so please keep it short.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.630
I risked my life to get here without Orochimaru finding out.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.730
I want information about

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.100
the location of his hideout and Sasuke.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.070
There are several hideouts.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.070
We move to a different hideout each week

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.230
so as not to get discovered.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.600
Of course there are hideouts,

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.570
not just in the Village Hidden in the Sound, but in other lands as well.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.100
Spies for Orochimaru infiltrate and act as informers.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.270
But there are all sorts of means of transport,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.970
so they're not easily tracked...

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.870
Where is it now?

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.370
We're now in a hideout

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.000
on a small island on a lake to the north.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.070
We'll be moving again in three days.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.700
Sasuke Uchiha is there as well.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.530
The sound of the wind is so loud I can't hear anything.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.600
You idiot! That's why we were able to get this close.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.770
The wind blows away the noise and smell, so we can sit here unnoticed.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.570
By the way...

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.870
Oh...it's just a wild rabbit.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.970
By the way...

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.700
About what you ordered me to do, Lord Sasori...

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.170
Uh oh...

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.200
I still had a few more things I wanted to ask him

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.600
while I had the chance, but...

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.000
I'll be discovered if the conversation continues any further...

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.900
Even after his reincarnation,

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.170
Orochimaru uses a Jutsu to apply a protector

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.670
to the cellular specimens from his discarded body...

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.600
And therefore I was unable to analyze the cellular data.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.330
I see...

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.530
What's he doing?! He should just grab him!

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.770
His opponent is Kabuto.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:05.630
Being overly cautious is just fine. It's all over if he gets away, right?

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.230
But...

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.200
The spy could get suspicious if he's too cautious...

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.870
and the timing to capture him will get thrown off.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.130
We'll...

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.400
just have to believe in Captain Yamato about that...

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.430
Now, please hand over the item in question immediately.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.230
I can't be hanging around here any longer.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.970
If it's discovered that I'm here with you like this...

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.900
I'll be killed.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.900
Okay...

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.170
I can't hold out any longer...

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.700
I just have to capture him here and now!

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.630
That conversation sounds interesting.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.430
Would you guys let me join in as well?

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.670
He was followed!

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:08.900
Orochimaru!

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.130
That's...?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.200
If you hadn't pulled out a Kunai Knife,

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.500
I wouldn't have been able to get away before I noticed.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.600
It looks like he's misunderstood nicely...

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.600
I guess I still haven't been discovered for now...

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.730
But...now that Orochimaru has shown up...

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.800
What should I do?

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:57.730
That outfit...sure takes me back... Sasori...

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.930
Did you follow Kabuto?

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.030
Oh... I just thought I'd thank you.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.200
This kid you sent to me... has come in very handy.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.700
The number of human subjects necessary for the development

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.470
of one new Jutsu is over a hundred...

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.430
Thanks to this kid's Medical Ninjutsu,

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:29.170
I've been able to reuse test subjects several times.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.600
There's been a great shortage of them, you see...

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:35.730
What do we do?!

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.070
We just have to stand by until the Captain gives us instructions.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.700
It would probably be impossible for me

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.330
 to take on Orochimaru alone...

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.670
But even if I can stop Orochimaru by working together with Kabuto...

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.100
he'll find out immediately that I'm not Sasori by my fighting style...

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.330
Even so, if I call those three...

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.930
then Kabuto will find out who I am

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.870
 and it will become difficult to capture him...

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.130
Either I have to immediately call the three and defeat both of them...

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.030
or retreat as is without calling them...

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.930
I'll have to do one or the other...

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.130
Have I been discovered?

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.000
No... that's not it...

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.370
What's the meaning of this?!

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.700
Multiple Striking Shadow Snake!

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.800
This is a Substitution created with the Wood Style Ninjutsu...

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.570
You... could it be...?

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:06.730
Lord Orochimaru. Is this Sasori's real body?

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.870
No... It isn't...

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.530
Kabuto... you didn't know his real face

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.370
even though you were his subordinate?

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.000
He was a broody guy who always stayed hidden

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.970
inside his puppets, after all...

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.700
What's the meaning of this...?!

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.730
Kabuto... you were supposed to be an Akatsuki spy...

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.330
Weren't you caught in one of Sasori's Jutsu all this time?!

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.500
Lord Orochimaru...broke that Jutsu for me ages ago...

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.400
I can't believe you went to the other side

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.930
pretending to be caught in one of Sasori's Jutsu...

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.670
Did you get caught in one of Orochimaru's Jutsu...?

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.870
No... that's not it.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.700
I just empathize with Lord Orochimaru's ideas.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.430
By the way, who are you?

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.400
The plan was to take care of Sasori.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.430
But something has gone quite wrong.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.630
Kabuto... I'll tell you about this kid later...

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:10.630
More importantly...

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.400
Why don't you call the three little mice behind you over here?

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.000
So he's seen through everything, huh...?

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:25.730
There's the signal!

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.200
You again, huh...?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.870
I've seen that face often...

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.630
And it looks like the Nine-Tails kid's here, too...

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.600
Maybe I'll play with you guys a little.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:54.870
Let's see who's gotten stronger, you...or Sasuke.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.930
You're starting to become more like a Jinchuriki aren't you, Naruto.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:43.400
That's...!

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.200
What kind of... Chakra is that?!

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.370
The air stings....

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.900
There's no mistake. The Nine-Tail's Cloak...!

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.600
That's the Jinchuriki's power?

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.130
I can tell just by the feel of it.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.970
This...This horrible Chakra...

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.570
It's not a Chakra quality that can be controlled!

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.100
So this is Naruto Uzumaki's... The Nine-Tail's power...!

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.630
Next Time: "The Nine-Tails Unleashed"
