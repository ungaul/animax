00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.900
The Unbreakable Mask and the Shattered Bubble Naruto…

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.940
Let us deal with this Madara!

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.150
I swear we shall settle this once and for all!

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.280
It will be our first step in stopping

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.900
the curse of hatred we've been under until now!

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.650
Like Madara, we are similarly guilty

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.150
of stirring up hatred in the past.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.690
It is our responsibility to make things right!

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.070
Rest assured and leave this to us!

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.940
So… You go take care of the other Madara!

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.940
That will become the first step in promoting hope for the future.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.320
Old one, new one…

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.820
Defeating both Madaras will bring an end to this war!

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.900
We will protect you on this battlefield!

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.730
So protect us by fighting over there!

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.070
Clone Naruto… I entrust you with this message from the Five Kage.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.400
We will win!

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.320
Yeah…

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.980
We're going to win!

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.110
Hey…

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.650
Chill out, Naruto… Fool, ya fool.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.320
Damn, it's so hard.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.360
I couldn't even put a crack in it.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.570
I could've let him pass through me…

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.230
But he couldn't even damage this mask.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.570
I hope that's not all the power you can muster

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.110
to control the Nine Tails…

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.780
Lava Style: Scorching Rocks Jutsu!

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.650
Hot!

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.980
Water Style… Aqua Mirror Jutsu!

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.030
These guys…

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.230
…have the same power…!

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.610
This is…

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.150
This jutsu… Is it Utakata?

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.400
Step away from that girl!

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.980
A Shadow Clone?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.400
What a bother…

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.400
Give it up and let yourself be caught!

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.320
No!

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.730
He is not an enemy!

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.320
This chakra…

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.030
Utakata, you were…a Jinchuriki?

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.530
You too, huh?

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.280
I heard rumors that you had gone missing.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.780
So the Akatsuki got you, after all.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.940
Yeah…

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.030
After I left you guys, they were lying in wait for me.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.440
This is where I first met you, Master.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.780
Hotaru… Will you wait here for just a while?

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.900
Is something the matter?

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.360
I'm going to meet with the Mist's Anbu Black Ops.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.480
I'm done running.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.190
I'm going to get their permission to travel and train you.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.440
Yes, sir!

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.820
No response, after all.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.320
Did something happen to Tsurugi and his men?

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.150
The Six Tails' Jinchuriki…

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.900
Are you the ones… who killed Tsurugi and the others?

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.690
I'm going to build a new world.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.440
And for that, I need you.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.400
Rather, I need the Tailed Beast inside you.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.030
So that's it.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.980
I'm taking you…Six Tails.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.280
Finally, you're taking this seriously.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.530
Now that's the power we seek…

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.940
Summoning Jutsu…

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.230
Go!

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.230
It's been captured.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.980
I expected as much out of you.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.650
Now come, Six Tails!

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.900
Hota…ru…

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.110
You…must live…

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.940
Master…

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.030
Why…

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.610
Why did you go into the forest alone?!

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.820
If you had escaped with Hotaru, you'd still be…

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.820
The Shinobi Tracking Unit from the village was in the forest.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.070
I grew tired of running.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.980
I wanted to reconcile with the village and live in peace.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.280
I wanted to stop living like a fugitive.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.570
And I wanted to spare Hotaru a life constantly on the run.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.730
Utakata, you…!

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.980
I wonder why I started feeling that way?

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.780
Why did I wish for such a dream?

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.940
Well, it's all meaningless now.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:21.510
I convinced myself that the master I trusted had betrayed me.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.840
And so, I closed off my heart.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.590
I didn't know how to trust people.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.840
And yet, Hotaru put her faith in someone like me.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.300
Hotaru was also burdened with a fate she hid from others.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.430
The same way we Jinchuriki are.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.590
Maybe she sensed that you and she were alike?

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.800
Hotaru…

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.470
Hotaru…

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.090
I didn't want to hurt anybody.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:26.970
And yet, I hurt Naruto and Sir Utakata!

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.800
I'm right here. Naruto and I are both alive.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.050
I…

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.550
Hotaru?

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.880
I… I betrayed you, Sir Utakata.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.800
I should just disappear along with this jutsu!

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.720
No! I won't allow that to happen.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.340
A student should listen to her master.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.630
You said… "Master"…

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.930
We're going home, Hotaru.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.220
What's wrong?

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.970
No!

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.130
No… Sir Utakata…

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.180
Please get away from me! Please run!

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.550
Hotaru!

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.840
I cannot suppress it any longer with my own strength!

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.130
This Forbidden Jutsu is going to tear me apart…

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.590
and explode.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.800
It's all right.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.340
Sir Utakata…

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.800
Believe in your master.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.260
I was like a bubble floating aimlessly in the wind

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.260
and Hotaru showed me the way.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.840
I made up my mind to become Hotaru's teacher.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.930
Isn't it ironic?

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.180
Just as I was about to make good on my decision,

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.720
my life was snatched away from me.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.800
I was resurrected,

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.590
only to discover that I have no will of my own,

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.380
and am forced to walk a different path.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.130
The ones manipulating you used the Akatsuki too,

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.550
and are hell bent on controlling the world.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.130
Are you just going to do what the likes of them order you to?

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.840
If you see Hotaru again, you might be forced to fight her

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.510
without being able to say anything!

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.180
You have the will to take yourself back.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.180
This is a meaningless fight.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.130
Naruto…

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.180
I don't know if it's because of these circumstances or not, but…

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.510
I just ended up telling you my true feelings.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.340
Thanks for listening…

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.010
Naruto!

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.930
Water Style: Bubble Jutsu!

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.090
Sorry, Octopops!

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.840
Secret Tradition… Scaled Sneak Jutsu.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.300
My shades are the best… So the light, with my eyes don't mess!

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.010
I can still see through their evil intent!

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.010
Wasn't that Yugito just now?

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.840
These guys are former Jinchuriki.

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.880
On top of that, each of them

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.050
has a Sharingan in one eye and a Rinnegan in the other.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.630
Not only did they lose their lives,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.090
their eyes were turned into those disgusting things.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.800
Poor Yugito…

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.680
This could have easily happened to you.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.970
This is no joke.

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.260
To see them like that I feel rage and grief…

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.090
But me not getting eyes like that is still a relief…

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.260
Well, you always wear shades anyway.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.970
If you don't want to end up like that, don't let your guard down!

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.340
Madara's eyes are the same.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.050
His mask's different from the one he used to wear before.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.380
It's got two openings!

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.300
Unlike the previous one, this mask was specially made.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.680
It's battle-grade tough.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.090
So the left eye you always kept hidden was a Rinnegan,

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.680
just like Nagato and that other Madara.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.840
We're going to stop both you Madaras!

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.760
Did you just say "both"?

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.550
Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.220
Th-This is…

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.130
Surely, you didn't think that I would come unprepared?

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.800
Yes. You can't refuse me.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.300
Why you…

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.760
Where did you get that?

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.090
Don't worry.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.340
I haven't told anyone about this.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.220
Damn that Kabuto…

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.840
Whaddya mean by "both," fool?

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.630
Isn't this Madara, ya fool?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.510
Well then, I don't mind using my previous name, Tobi.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:09.970
Now that the war's begun, names don't matter.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:14.970
Madara… Tobi… Call me what you like.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:20.010
Just who are you anyway?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.220
I'm no one. I don't want to be anyone.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.880
All I want…is the success of Project Tsuki no Me, that's all.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.130
Existing in this world that knows only despair has no value.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.510
You Jinchuriki had Tailed Beasts forced into you

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.380
and you've only experienced despair.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.300
Am I wrong?

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:48.880
Surely, you can understand a little of my despair.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.130
Who the hell are you to decide…

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.180
that having a Tailed Beast in me makes me unhappy?!

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.300
Even if this world is worthless to you,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.090
you really think you can get away with starting a war

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.340
and trying to say that you're a nobody?

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.510
You piss me off.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.130
I'm gonna rip that mask off of you!

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.760
I'll go first! Wheee!

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.930
Taking this mask off of me…

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.720
won't be so easy.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.970
What?!

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.090
Eight Tails… Nine Tails…

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:59.760
You shall be mine and I'll achieve Project Tsuki no Me!

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.530
What's going on?

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.660
I thought their Tailed Beasts were extracted from them!

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.830
They were probably made back into Jinchuriki

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.990
after they were reanimated.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:48.280
It's like when I fought the Six Paths of Pain.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.990
They are linked through the same Rinnegan!
