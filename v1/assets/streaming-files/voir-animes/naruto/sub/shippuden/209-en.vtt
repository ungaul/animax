WEBVTT

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.280
Tailed Beast Counting Song!

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.110
All right, here we go!

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.980
One, "sleep is better than humans," says Shukaku

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.570
ONE TAIL SHUKAKU / GAARA One, "sleep is better than humans," says Shukaku

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.980
Two, burning in fire, Matatabi

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.570
TWO TAILS MATATABI / YUGITO NI'I Two, burning in fire, Matatabi

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.980
Three, leave the water to Isobu

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.570
THREE TAILS ISOBU / YAGURA Three, leave the water to Isobu

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.940
Four, hot as lava, Son Goku

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.610
FOUR TAILS SON GOKU / ROSHI Four, hot as lava, Son Goku

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.030
Five, always on the run, Kokuo

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.570
FIVE TAILS KOKUO / HAN Five, always on the run, Kokuo

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.980
Six, taking it easy and not in a hurry, Saiken

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.530
SIX TAILS SAIKEN / UTAKATA Six, taking it easy and not in a hurry, Saiken

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.940
Seven, the flying leaf insect, Chomei

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.570
SEVEN TAILS CHOMEI / FUU Seven, the flying leaf insect, Chomei

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.940
Eight, "Yeah!" is all it needs, Gyuki

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.440
EIGHT TAILS GYUKI / KILLER BEE Eight, "Yeah!" is all it needs, Gyuki

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.940
Nine, "ko-kon" cries the mighty Kurama

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.570
NINE TAILS KURAMA / NARUTO UZUMAKI Nine, "ko-kon" cries the mighty Kurama

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.480
All the Tailed Beasts have finally come together

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.610
They're a little hard, but they're nice names

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.650
They're all splendid names They're all wonderful names

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.440
Hey everyone!

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.900
Please try to learn Kurama and the others' names, okay?

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.090
The Risks of the Reanimation Jutsu

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.880
You think you can beat me with Hashirama's will?

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.510
Power is not will.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.010
Power is only the ability to make things happen.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.380
You're wrong!

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.220
The will of the dead shows its power

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.720
in those they left behind!

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.300
I used that will to develop my Medical Ninjutsu.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.760
From there, Medic Ninja and Medical Laws were established!

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.970
Rule One! A Medic Ninja must never give up on treatment

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.840
until their patient's dying breath.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.380
Rule Two! A Medic Ninja must never go to the frontlines!

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.090
Rule Three!

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.050
A Medic Ninja should always be

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.260
the last of their platoon to die!

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.630
This is what I teach my students.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.430
But there is actually one more rule…

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.430
Rule Four!

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.180
A Medic Ninja who masters

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.340
the Ninja Art of Mitotic Regeneration, the 100 Healings…

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.510
may break the first three rules!

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.430
The 100 Healings Jutsu?

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.590
I've never heard of it.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.510
It's a Forbidden Jutsu that applies only to me.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.430
Which means,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.430
I am the only Medic Ninja allowed to battle!

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.300
The Particle Style Jutsu may have dissipated the pollen…

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.880
But adding one Medic Ninja won't make any difference…

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.340
Four wasn't working, so we'll try five!

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.300
Don't you dare think I'm an ordinary Medic Ninja!

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.300
She's not as fast as the Raikage… Let's go!

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.130
But her power is greater than his!

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.050
Fire Style… Majestic Demolisher Flame!

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.590
Water Style: Water Pillar!

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.510
Water Style! Water Dragon Missile!

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.340
Weighted Boulder!

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.380
Lateral Bolt of Pain! Chop!

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.510
I admit… You're not weak, woman.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.260
However…

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.380
If you step in and die here,

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.340
all the other Kage will die.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.180
Since you're the only one who can heal them.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.720
That's if I die.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.510
Hashirama… I don't know what you left behind…

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.720
But this falls far short of your abilities.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.180
If you were going to let your underlings take over,

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.800
you should have taught them how to resurrect you too…

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.800
All that's left of you is the life force of your cells

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.800
that cling to me.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.840
All that's left of my little brother is

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.720
the Visual Prowess of his eyes, which are now mine.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.300
That's why…

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.470
I said you're wrong!

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.340
The only thing that is passed down…

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.930
is hatred.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.180
What?!

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.550
Madara was brought back with the Reanimation?

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.430
Now that the real Madara showed up,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.630
the Five Kage had to step in!

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.090
As the Hokage, Lady Tsunade has joined the battle as well.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.470
Tsunade is the Hokage?!

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.470
She became the Hokage?!

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.680
Did I neglect to tell you?

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.260
Well, Lady Tsunade went through quite a lot after your passing…

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.010
But in the end, it just showed how much she cared about you.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.680
Tsunade…

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.010
There's no way Lady Tsunade will lose!

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.340
That's why she is the sole surviving member

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.050
of the Legendary Sannin!

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.430
You're already dead!

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.430
So don't spread any more hate!

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.180
Kazekage! Now!

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.760
Grand Sand Mausoleum!

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.970
He's been sealed!

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.470
All right!

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.800
The one you sealed away is a Wood Style Clone

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.760
that Hashirama used to use.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.630
It is well made…

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.430
My Visual Prowess made me the only shinobi who was able to see the ruse…

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.010
in the past.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.380
Now then… It's over for the rest of you Kage…

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.090
Don't underestimate Madara!

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.470
The only way to stop Madara is to stop

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.720
the one who cast the Reanimation.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.430
Is Madara… that powerful a shinobi?

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.680
Even against the Five Kage facing him now?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.300
Aside from the late First Hokage…

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.380
there is no one right now who can defeat Madara in battle…

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.010
My guard and my barrier sustainer should stay here.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.720
Everyone else should be going after the caster of the Reanimation Jutsu!

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.220
How is HQ dealing with this?

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.630
Every effort is being made,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.430
but there's been no concrete intel…

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.340
Don't die…Tsunade!

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.510
Summoning Jutsu!

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.470
Damn it!

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.510
You stay here.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.300
There, huh?

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.090
What a useless barrier.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.470
I'm impressed you were able to pass through my barrier,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.130
and find this place.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.760
When you were controlling me,

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.220
I was able to pinpoint where your chakra was coming from.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.800
That's another risk of this jutsu.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.880
Though you won't need to remember that for next time.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.050
Thanks for the tip.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.430
I didn't expect any shinobi to counter this jutsu,

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.130
so I didn't even worry about it.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.510
By the way, there's something I'd like you to know as well.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.300
This Reanimation Jutsu will not come undone

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.260
even if you kill me.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.680
But I am the only one who can stop it.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.680
In other words… You can't kill me.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.470
If I die, you'll never be able to stop this jutsu.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.340
I guess my luck hasn't run out yet!

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.130
Things are not always as we wish them to be, damn it!

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.430
I caught up to you!

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.340
What the hell are you doing here?

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.180
Is that…Orochimaru?

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.970
You're a little off…

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.300
That voice… Kabuto!

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.380
It's perfect timing that my compensation for participating in this war

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.430
would show up, on his own, at this particular moment…

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.470
I am so lucky.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.300
What are you talking about?

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.630
What are you both doing here?

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:55.090
It's rather complicated… Let me try to explain.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.930
Go ahead.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.550
And in the meantime, I'll stop the Reanimation.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.300
This jutsu has neither risks nor weaknesses.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.510
I want you to understand that Itachi.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.380
Even if you do make a move,

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.550
I doubt Sasuke will just sit back and watch.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.300
If you rush, you may not succeed,

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.590
even if it were possible, conversely…

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.800
Kabuto, answer my question!

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.180
I guess I have to tell you, after all.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.130
I mean, while you were asleep

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.550
from having your brother's eyes transplanted into you…

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.300
something drastic happened in our world.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.380
Tobi started the war, huh?

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.380
So you know a little.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.260
Yes, that's true…

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.090
The Fourth Great Ninja War…

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.430
Tobi and I are at war with the coalition

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.340
of the Nations of Fire, Wind, Water, Earth and Lightning…

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:59.340
The Allied Shinobi Force.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.470
There's no way you two can fight

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.840
against the Five Great Nations!

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.380
Oh, but we can…

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.470
With a hundred thousand mass-produced White Zetsu!

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.470
And the reanimated battalion that I created…

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.880
Kinkaku and Ginkaku!

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.220
The former members of

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.300
the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist!

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.840
The Second Tsuchikage…

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.880
The Third Raikage…

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.300
The Second Mizukage… The Fourth Kazekage…

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.470
And Madara Uchiha…

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.970
I don't have time to mention all the names.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.800
Your brother over there is also one of the ones I reanimated.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.340
Well?

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.590
Not too shabby, huh?

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.180
Although Madara Uchiha planned everything.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.050
What do you mean?

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.760
Like you two, he hated the Shinobi World.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.130
And so, he came up with Project Tsuki no Me.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.840
Project Tsuki no Me?

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.470
A plan to cast a powerful genjutsu over the entire world

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.180
using the Ten Tails.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.380
To control the world.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.300
For that, we need Naruto's Nine Tails

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.430
and Killer Bee's Eight Tails.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.430
And just about now…

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.970
Madara is causing a ruckus on the battlefield in order to get them.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.340
Now then, who's next…?

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.300
How can you move?

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.220
Like I told you, I'm different!

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.380
Regeneration without weaving signs…

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:24.760
So that's the real power of your jutsu mentioned in Rule Four.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.010
It's just like Hashirama's power.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.760
I wanted to catch you off guard with this, but…

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.300
You can't kill me with my own jutsu.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.590
I can kill you, with my jutsu!

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.300
All right!

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.260
Have you gone senile, Ohnoki?

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.380
The Rinnegan can absorb all jutsu.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.010
Ninjutsu like that will not work against me!

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.300
To kill me, you need to hit me hard physically and seal me.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.260
You know that.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.590
My Particle Style grazed your chest earlier…

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.340
There's no way that the Atomic Dismantling Jutsu didn't work!

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.880
Oh that…

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.430
I just wanted to show you all Hashirama's face.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.760
I wanted to reduce your morale…

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.340
But it seems it had the opposite effect… It boosted your morale instead.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.630
Let me ask you a question.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.590
While it doesn't change the fact

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.130
that you outwitted us with the Wood Style Clone…

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.880
But from another angle,

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.590
you could say we managed to corner you

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.800
into having to substitute a clone for yourself.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.260
Am I wrong?

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.220
It is five against one, after all…

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.430
Even if it is five-to-one, we must win, no matter what.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.300
Don't call it unfair!

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.430
In truth, it is a testament to your might!

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.180
You are Madara Uchiha!

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.300
It's not unfair.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.180
Five-to-one… It's just the right ratio for playing games.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.430
Now it's five-to-one.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.470
Don't say this is unfair.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.550
You are the Five Kage.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.470
So now I've got a question for you…

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.630
Would you like these clones to use Susano'o or not?

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.340
Your choice.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.880
So that's the story of the war…

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:47.470
But what is a Reanimation like you doing here?

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.680
Your intent to kill is real.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.930
The reason is simple…

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.630
I'm not under his control.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.470
You're absolutely right.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.050
I must hand it to you, Itachi Uchiha.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.720
Imagine, overwriting the Reanimation Jutsu

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.300
with your genjutsu…

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.550
Normally, one wouldn't even think of that.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:12.930
Sorry, but I hate taking orders.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.180
Well, I agree with you there.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.840
You haven't answered all my questions!

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.840
Just because you asked doesn't mean

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.090
you're going to get a reply.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.300
You haven't changed from the days

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.470
when you were the popular one at the Academy.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.300
Meaning…I'm still forceful?

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.680
Just kidding!

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.880
Looks like your big brother here…

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.090
I came to kill you.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.630
You heard him.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.970
Reanimation… You got a hold of a silly Forbidden Jutsu.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.260
But you see, thanks to this jutsu,

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.090
you siblings get to have a touching reunion.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.840
I was hoping for a little gratitude here.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.220
Reanimation can't control the heart.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.010
You've desecrated souls that were purified

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.300
and continue to spread unnecessary sadness and hate.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.590
Can you understand the pain

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.300
felt by the dead who are forced to fight?

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.630
The pain of the living is even greater.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.380
After finally getting over the grief and sadness…

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.720
your jutsu has stirred those feelings again!

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.220
Well... I'm a little surprised…

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.470
that someone who slaughtered the entire Uchiha Clan

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.550
has such a tender heart…

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.260
Does it mean you regret it?

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.470
If so, I'm not interested.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.880
Say whatever you want.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.680
You die here.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:46.970
Sasuke…

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.840
You want to bring down Itachi,

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.180
the bane of the Uchiha, once again, don't you?

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.130
Since I brought him back to this realm.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.760
In short, Itachi is a nuisance to both you and myself.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:06.630
Well? Shall we team up and take down Itachi together?

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.470
We share the same power of the snake and the same Master—

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.430
I have no intention of calling that thing my Master!

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.380
Besides, it seems like you don't know anything, do you?

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.930
I chased Itachi all the way here to talk to him.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.510
Well then…whose side are you on right now?

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.300
Why?!

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.340
He's just like Orochimaru!

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.050
Which means he's my enemy!

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.970
And right now, he's your enemy too, right?!

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.380
All right, we'll talk later.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.340
First things first, let's take him down.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.880
But don't kill him.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.050
If you kill the caster of the Reanimation,

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.970
the jutsu can never be undone.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.380
We'll put him under my Tsukuyomi,

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.930
then we'll make him tell us how to stop this jutsu.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.970
And while he's still under the Tsukuyomi,

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.470
I'll control him and… I'll break this jutsu.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.840
Thanks for the play-by-play.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.300
I hope it goes as smoothly as you say.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.550
But I told you earlier,

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.260
this jutsu has neither weakness nor risks—

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.970
Every jutsu has a weakness.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.470
This jutsu's weakness and risk…

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.010
is my existence!

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.430
Itachi…you've kept lying to me,

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.380
telling me "next time" or "later," then you died on me…

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.880
So this time for sure…

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.720
I'm holding you to your promise.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.260
They say you take your personality to the grave.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.220
Well, I've already died once.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.800
I intend to honor it.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.180
The estranged brothers come together to gang up on me?

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.260
How fun!

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.430
Those snakes are sensing exactly where we are.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.590
Snakes perceive body heat and smell with their tongues.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.760
You've studied a lot! You're like a snake expert now.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.510
Of course I did. In order to take down Orochimaru!

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.180
I'm no longer a snake…

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.340
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Sibling Tag Team"

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.090
I am now a dragon!

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:08.470
SIBLING TAG TEAM Tune in again!
