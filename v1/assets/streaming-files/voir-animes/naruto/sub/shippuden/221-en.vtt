00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.140
I'm in Hell

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.310
Hey there.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.100
How are you doing?

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.310
Bad… What do you think?

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.770
How long have I been here?

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.100
It feels like it's been a while.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.350
Don't worry, you don't need to pay rent.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.520
Those of us created from the Gedo Statue don't have to eat either.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.140
No food bills, no need for a bathroom.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.230
We don't even poo!

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.310
Don't lump me in with you guys!

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.020
I just have half of that weird stuff stuck onto me.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.640
And thanks to that, you can survive without eating or drinking.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.100
In fact, you should be grateful and thank us.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.140
Good grief. We're the ones who don't want to be lumped in with you!

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.390
What you have is emotionless synth-tissue.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.100
We are full artificial humans. We have feelings and everything!

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.430
You may have a better sense of humor, but what we have is much better!

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.140
Both our vocabulary skills and mental acuity are far higher than yours!

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.520
But we don't poo… Shut up!

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.270
All right, explain how you're at a higher level than I am!

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.310
We are… The ones…

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.600
– in charge of watching you! – in charge of watching you!

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.310
Don't talk in synch! That pisses me off!

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.930
We're only helping you with your rehab

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.180
because Madara ordered us to get you up and running

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.730
and usable by the time he wakes up.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.770
So he makes these noisy puppets keep an eye on me…

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.850
while he gets to sleep the whole time?

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.310
I swear I'm gonna get outta here and return to Rin and Kakashi!

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.230
Where's the exit?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.350
Can't be done…there's no exit.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.100
Madara sealed it off with a huge boulder…

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.060
after we lugged you here on his orders.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.730
What?! He sealed us in?!

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.230
By the way, you've been saying "Rin-Rin-Rin" in your sleep a lot.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.930
Do you want to go outside to collect a bell or something?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.810
Once in a while, you said "stupid-stupid-stupid.”

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.770
And "stupid Kakashi."

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.680
Yeah, yeah, that's right! Every so often.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.850
What's a "stupid Kakashi"?

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.560
Beats me. Why don't you ask him?

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.060
Was I really saying that?

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.890
Um, may we ask you a question!

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.310
What?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.930
When nature calls…

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.810
In short, what does the urge to poo feel like?

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.890
For example…

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.480
I thought you wanted to know about stupid Kakashi!

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.180
Why are you guys so obsessed with poop?

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.230
You don't have to get so angry.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.890
All right, we'll ask you about Rin and stupid Kakashi later.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.060
Especially you, with the swirly face…

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.640
You don't poop, but you look like poop.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.230
I hate you!

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.140
Anyway, where'd the other white guys go?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.480
They went outside to collect intel.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.640
What?! You guys can get out?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.100
We can all move through the earth's surface.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.180
What the hell?!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.810
I'm locked up in here,

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.560
and I have to hear about all this weird stuff.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.680
So sorry to have bothered you about poo!

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.350
That's not what I meant!

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.390
I mean, what Madara talked about!

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.310
Something about severing fate and all…

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.600
Oh, that…

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.350
Madara's not nice enough to talk to a brat at his level.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.850
Simply put, he's talking about discarding

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.480
all the bad things in the real world and

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.230
escaping inside a dream that's full of good things!

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.930
Inside a dream?

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.480
Since it's a dream, everything is how you want it!

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.350
Even those who are dead can be alive again!

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.560
Yeah…

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.140
Just think of it as all of us going to this huge dream world

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.180
that was created using genjutsu!

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.180
Well, it's more like forcibly taking everyone there…

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.230
and for life too.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.930
With genjutsu?

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.430
That's so beyond stupid, I can't even understand it.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.810
If you have as much power as Madara, anything is possible.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.560
It's just that he's weak right now and can't do it yet.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.680
Much still needs to be prepared.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.230
Oh really? Well, I'm not interested.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.270
More importantly…

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.890
I swear I'm gonna make it outside!

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.680
And get back to Rin and Kakashi!

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.680
What?

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.100
I've got to get this body working again…

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.730
Yaaaay!

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.100
What?!

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.100
Don't act tough and hide your wounds!

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.140
I'm always watching, you know.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.980
It's starting to feel natural.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.100
Just a bit longer.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.430
I'll see you soon, Rin… Kakashi!

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.100
I was just outside!

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.020
Your friends, Rin and stupid Kakashi, are in trouble!

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.270
What happened?!

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.390
They're alone and completely surrounded by Hidden Mist Shinobi!

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.180
You can't break through boulders with that body yet.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:41.060
I have to save Rin and Kakashi…

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.810
Why don't you wear my body?

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.520
But you guys serve Madara. Are you sure about this?

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.020
He's…a good boy.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.560
Don't you want to help Rin and Kakashi?

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.180
Thanks, you guys!

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:40.290
You kept the root tethered and borrowed the statue's power eh? Nice.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.130
I'm pretty good, huh?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.920
All right!

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.710
So you're going?

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.750
I'm grateful that you saved me.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.580
But I'm leaving. I have to go.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.080
You're being too hasty…

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.290
It may be premature to thank me.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.540
I'll probably never come back here.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.580
I've given my thanks.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.000
I'm going!

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.630
You…will return.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.500
And that's when I'll get your true gratitude.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.420
White one! What's Rin and Kakashi's location?!

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.670
Take me there right away!

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.210
What you've got on your body is like a clone of me.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.040
And we can talk telepathically to each other over limited distances.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.750
Others of us are scattered here and there underground.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.920
We're able to exchange intel.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.580
I'll use them to guide you.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.080
Swirly!

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.210
First, we need to get outside.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.670
I'm counting on you.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.830
How are Rin and Kakashi doing right now?

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.500
According to the others, it looks pretty bad.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.210
They're talking about some Hidden Mist test subjects,

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.420
but I don't really understand.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.580
Test subjects?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.080
Anyway, it seems Rin and Kakashi are totally surrounded.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:44.040
And they're saying they all appear to be jonin or Black Ops.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.460
What's Minato Sensei doing?

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.630
Who is that?

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.210
I'm asking you what the Yellow Flash of the Leaf is doing!

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.250
Seems he's on a different mission.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.500
At a time like this?!

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.130
Kakashi… Look after Rin for me.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.040
I will.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.540
Kakashi! You made me a promise!

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.130
Please…

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.000
Please protect Rin somehow!

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.540
I'll be right there!

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.670
Obito, this will probably turn into a battle.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.250
So I want to tell you some things beforehand.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.290
What is it?!

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.330
Your fighting ability is lower than mine.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.670
Plus right now, it's like my big body is wrapped around

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:38.080
and protecting your wounded little body.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.630
So what?!

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.080
I think it would be better if I do all the fighting.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.710
Remember what Madara said?

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.000
That only with a pair together

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.130
can the Sharingan's true power be unleashed!

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.080
Kakashi, the other half of my pair, will be on the battlefield.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.420
Our combo attacks are superior!

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.670
Kakashi and I will protect Rin!

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.460
As I recall, you do have Hashirama's tissue attached to you.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.040
A whole different strength may emerge

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:16.420
when Senju and Uchiha powers are combined together, but…

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.040
What was that?

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.500
I thought it was rain, but it's…

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.710
I just got word from one of my guys.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.920
It seems…

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.170
That's the location.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.920
Let's go!

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.170
What's happening?!

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.380
Stop showing these weird images!

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.750
A little bit…

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.000
Just a little bit farther!

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.210
Kakashi…

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.830
Damn it! He did it!

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.170
After all the trouble we went through to get her!

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.830
Rin…

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.130
Where…

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.170
in the world…

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.080
is this place?!

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.630
Who is that guy?

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:42.830
Reinforcements maybe?

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.130
What a fool, jumping in alone!

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.000
I won't accept it!

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.750
I will not… What just happened?!

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.210
Did he dodge them?

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.170
…accept any of this!

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.170
Do not mock the Blood Mist Village!

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.580
Die!

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.960
I can't hit him!

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.000
Who is that guy?!

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.790
He wields a strange jutsu!

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.710
At least grab the girl!

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.000
Don't hand her corpse over to the enemy!

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.040
There's no mistake! This guy passes right through you!

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.580
All of a sudden,

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.460
he's able to use the Wood Style Cutting Sprigs Jutsu…

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.250
Obito, now I understand why Madara chose you!

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.920
What is he?

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:45.880
I get it…

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:48.790
I'm…

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:55.830
I'm…
