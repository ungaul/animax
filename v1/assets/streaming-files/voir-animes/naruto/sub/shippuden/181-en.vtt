WEBVTT

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.360
It's no use! We can't lose them.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.780
Tango! Get HQ!

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.860
The Commando Unit, attempting to retreat, is reporting

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.980
that the enemy pursuit team is closing in.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.570
A relief team from Fifth Company has been dispatched.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.780
Give them the coordinates of the closest rendezvous point.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.280
It's just from one segment, but they're voicing opposition.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.650
They are saying most samurai remain neutral,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.940
so why must we team up with the shinobi?

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150
Samurai are neutral, eh?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.480
They say that because they don't know the past.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.570
Moreover, they cannot understand the current situation.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.150
Some also say that

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.570
a shinobi war must be resolved by the shinobi themselves.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.110
Yet these former foes still cannot find a common ground.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.980
How do they expect to end this without our help?

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.480
Go forth! Show them how we samurai fight!

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.480
– Right! – Right!

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.610
Mifune vs. Hanzo

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.030
I said let me outta here, hmm!

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.190
Lord Orochimaru's chakra is penetrating my skull

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.730
and coursing throughout my body.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.610
I must succeed in my mission.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.780
Over that way…

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.530
Whether it was Akatsuki or Orochimaru…

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.900
Whoever revived me will regret it!

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.530
Everyone is going to think I was playing possum again!

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.280
How embarrassing is that?!

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.530
I'm trying to focus. Can you shut up, puppet granny?

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.980
You shut up, old man snorkel face!

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.400
Just a little more.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.070
This is close enough.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.690
Summoning Jutsu!

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.730
Wha—?!

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.940
Ibuse, do it!

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.230
Poison Fog!

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.900
What?!

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.030
He resorted to the poison because he was fed up with chasing us?!

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.070
Damn it!

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.570
I should be resistant to poison, but my body's going numb.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.940
Are those reinforcements?!

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.900
Hey, I'm over here!

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.610
I've caught up to you.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.070
Damn it!

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.730
Hanzo, I presume?

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.980
I am Mifune, leader of the samurai.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.980
I wish to challenge you!

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.530
We're saved.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.980
Sorry we're late.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.360
Are you all right?!

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.070
Be careful. The enemy uses poison.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.110
The masks we wear are specially made for fighting ninja

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.110
and are impervious to poison.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.150
Put it on!

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.230
Thanks.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.900
They need antidotes!

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.860
Take the Commando Unit members to the Medical Corps immediately!

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.110
Lord Mifune!

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.860
Assistance is unnecessary!

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.650
If you don't want to get hurt, stay out of my way.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.030
So you're Mifune.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.940
Why do you side with the shinobi?

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.610
You are staunchly samurai.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.280
To be serving the shinobi…

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.610
How can you call yourself samurai?

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.190
We do not serve the shinobi.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.530
The one master that we follow has never changed since the olden days.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.980
It is peace!

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.070
Peace?!

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.900
We pledge ourselves to peace, and act upon that conviction!

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.860
The battlefield is getting lively.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.230
Now then…

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.690
Lady Chiyo!

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.190
I haven't been playing dead.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.190
You understand, don't you, Kankuro?

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.980
Uh…yes?

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.360
Never mind that.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.400
Hanzo controls a poison salamander!

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.230
I fought him many times in the past.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.940
That's why I know the ingredients to the antidote.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.650
I am also aware that the salamander takes five minutes

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.400
to produce and store up its poison.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.070
That old hag… Rambling on about everything!

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.650
Ibuse! Retreat for now!

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.030
Even though I'm being manipulated,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.820
it seems I don't have to fight them right now.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.190
Then you, Hanzo…

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.110
You must know who my original foe in battle was!

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.980
I will not hold back from the Five Great Shinobi Nations!

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.900
I am going.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.780
Here he comes!

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.610
It's hard?!

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.400
You countered that nicely.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.070
You're not bad for a weak man of peace and neutrality.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.360
Don't look at me that way.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.400
I once sought peace myself.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.780
I wanted to unite the Five Great Nations

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.320
into one shinobi world.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.400
But I realized right away that such a thing was impossible.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.980
Realized?

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.780
Battle after battle after battle….

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.320
And all that's left at the end is death!

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.320
"Pledge yourselves to peace?!"

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.400
You know better than anyone, what happened to that samurai!

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.940
Many samurai have become shinobi instead,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.070
and your techniques have been passed over to the shinobi.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.150
Capture them!

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.860
Sorry, but my body is acting on its own and running away.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.650
Samurai no longer have a role in this world!

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.030
They don't believe in peace, are influenced only by money,

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.980
and their roles have been taken over by ninja who wield powerful ninjutsu.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.940
Those shinobi fight and die, leaving nothing behind.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.440
I am the same.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.650
You are wrong.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.230
It's not about life or death.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.030
I don't care if I lose my life in the pursuit of peace!

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.730
Having conviction is to stir oneself into action!

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.400
Your conviction has been warped!

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.980
According to the Samurai Way,

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.780
people are the sword and they can live on in memories…

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.690
like my Famed Blade Kurosawa.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.530
Do not compare people to swords!

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.940
What can you possibly glean from a lump of iron?

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.070
Take your ritual of seppuku.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:38.440
Why do you samurai try to diminish one's own life?

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.980
I repeat…conviction does not fade.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.230
Enough of this nonsense!

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.780
I will get rid of you samurai, once and for all.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.190
I will not allow you to use ninjutsu beyond this point!

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.280
The rumors were right. You are indeed a master swordsman.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.780
This is what they meant by ninjutsu being useless on you.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.690
You didn't even give me time to weave a sign.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.480
And that second attack with my sickle and chain…

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.480
Even if one was familiar with that move,

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.690
no one has ever countered it.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.980
Long ago, when I was still unknown, you and I fought,

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.650
although you probably do not remember.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.030
Is that so? Then why aren't you dead?

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.150
You snapped my sword with that sickle and chain,

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.480
and slashed my head.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.440
But somehow I survived.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.190
So you're that samurai…

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.440
You didn't die?

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.820
Well then, this time I will make certain of it.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.360
Unfortunately, that will not happen.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.980
From that first blow,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.940
I understood why someone, who was as strong as you, was killed.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.570
What?! What do you mean?

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.940
I'm amazed that a shinobi of your caliber did not notice.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.400
Don't you remember how you died?

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.480
Who could bring me to this point?

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.150
Have you forgotten my face?

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.980
You are… Yahiko of Akatsuki!

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.610
You are supposed to be dead.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.190
What's going on?!

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.530
You teamed up with Danzo and betrayed us.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.780
You now only think of self-preservation.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.940
You're trash.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.480
I once respected you.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.820
But, you have changed.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.440
Just who are you?!

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.570
How can you be so strong?!

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:57.610
And you don't even understand why you will lose.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:59.980
Vanish, Hanzo!

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.570
S-Stop…

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.190
What do they mean?

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.400
What is it that I'm not seeing?!

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.530
Be bathed in venom and die!

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.190
I've had enough of your nonsense.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.110
What?!

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.320
A sword that is continuously honed will gain renown

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.320
and will be passed on. And…

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.900
Men who cling to their convictions and defend them

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.690
become heroes whose stories live on throughout the ages!

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.570
How?!

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.530
How were you able to cut me this time?!

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.400
The blade is not stained at all.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.610
Is he that fast?!

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.400
You lost your conviction and stopped honing your skills.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.480
Your swordsmanship has lost its edge!

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.030
Your blade is dull, dirtied by blood and rusted.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.480
A dull blade is worthless!

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.940
People are like swords!

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.400
You did not remember me.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:50.820
And you probably don't recall what you said as you left me to die.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.730
It's salamander poison.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.400
I smeared it on my sickle too.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.570
But do not fear.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.230
The poison will numb the pain and you will die within two days.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.480
Do you know why I am feared as Hanzo the Salamander?

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.480
I shall tell you my secret.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.690
Consider it a parting gift.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.320
In my village, there was a venomous black salamander.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.780
I was just a boy then, but when it died,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.940
its venom sac was implanted in me.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.820
Right around here…

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.440
in order to turn me into a man capable of producing poison.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:41.400
I can poison people just by breathing on them.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.530
From the time I was a child, I was feared.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:49.190
So I was forced to breathe through this mask.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:54.400
Then why didn't you take off your mask during our fight?

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.610
I've done that in the past.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.570
But doing that has risks.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.570
The mask serves another purpose.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.610
It protects me as well.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.360
If during battle, the venom sac is cut and ruptured,

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.530
the poison would vaporize.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.730
Even with my resistance,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.360
my body could not counter the powerful gas,

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.780
and I would be paralyzed.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.400
It wouldn't kill me, but it would give my foe an opportunity to attack.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.730
Against someone of your caliber,

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.780
I must keep the mask on to prevent that.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.780
Although, my blade was indeed dull.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.820
People are like swords…

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.480
Which means that I wasn't sharp.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.820
I will tell you one thing.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.480
Death is not the end.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.780
Loss of conviction is the end.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.360
That's why it's such a nuisance.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.780
It's hard to discern one's conviction just by looking at them

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.570
If you die here, it wasn't because you weren't sharp.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.780
Blame your comrades, who cowered at the first mention of my name,

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:17.610
and gave up, leaving you to fight me.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.980
H-Hanzo the Salamander?!

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.480
R-Run!

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.940
You used your body as a shield to protect them.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.400
I shall spread word of your heroism.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.030
So state your name as compensation for your death!

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.730
"As compensation for my death…"

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.980
Promise me one thing.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.480
Say it.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.690
Leave my fellow samurai alone!

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.860
Here's the antidote.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:10.320
I told you that it's hard to discern one's conviction just by looking at them.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.570
But it's possible by fighting them.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.610
It's been a while since I fought someone like you.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.230
I will spare you this time.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:24.360
Well, it's possible that you'll die, even if you take the antidote.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.610
It is difficult to see one's convictions through.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.610
I, too, have my own conviction.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.190
To bring peace to this world.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.360
I'm going to use you as a test.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.650
To see if you will die, still embracing your convictions…

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.400
Or you end up surviving,

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.190
and abandoning those convictions over time.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.320
You're the one who insisted on testing me.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.780
Have you really abandoned your conviction?

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:16.570
Well, that's hard to tell just by looking.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.280
There is a way to stop me, even though I am immortal.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.570
I believed I explained it to you before, Mifune.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.780
So step back and wait for the opportunity to seal me.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.070
I believe you are… Lord Mifune!

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.440
His poison!

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.190
I'm fine.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.530
I am resistant to this poison.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.280
But that may not be the case from here on.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.570
Everyone, retreat with me and get ready to seal him!

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.440
Just as I thought.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.110
He didn't survive the poisoning for nothing.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.320
We'll observe from here.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.190
Lord Hanzo…

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.150
Mifune…I…

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.610
entrust you with my conviction!

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.400
Seppuku?!

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.820
By a shinobi?!

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.190
He's defied the orders in my tag!

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.570
Suicide?!

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:34.150
I have no choice but to switch him to mindless mode now.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.400
Why isn't he moving?

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.690
Hanzo would never take orders from one who hides behind the shadows,

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:59.480
manipulating others like puppets.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.440
You put your life on the line and regained your conviction.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.400
My friend, you were no dull blade.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:08.530
Seal him!
Yes!

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.480
They sealed him.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.940
I shall spread word of your heroism.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.900
I hereby witness your unwavering conviction.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.900
Lord Hanzo, you were admirable indeed!

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.400
Lord Mifune?

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.530
I understand Hanzo did not have a grave.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.570
I must find someplace suitable for him.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.400
What are you doing, Choji?! I am your enemy right now!

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.070
Your movements are slow, Choji!

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.320
Pull yourself together!

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.900
We prepared ourselves for this.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:52.980
This is too much for me. I can't take our sensei down!

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:57.610
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "True Kindness"

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.900
Choji, fight! You coward! TRUE KINDNESS

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:08.980
TRUE KINDNESS Tune in again!
