WEBVTT

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.300
They say you take your personality to the grave…

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.680
Well, I've already died once.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.220
I intend to honor it.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.090
The estranged brothers come together to gang up on me?

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.430
How fun!

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.340
Sibling Tag Team

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.430
Bookish types like me aren't used to being stared at.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.300
Countermeasures for genjutsu, huh?

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.970
Judging from their movements,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.300
those snakes can sense exactly what we're doing.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.630
Snakes perceive their surroundings through body heat

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.430
and smell through their tongues.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.510
You've studied a lot!

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.680
You're like a snake expert now.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.300
Of course I did. In order to take down Orochimaru!

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.090
However…

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.380
You can't beat me by just being a snake expert.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.760
This is my field. Nature is on my side.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.760
The snakes have gotten bigger!

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.430
Does this terrain give him an advantage?

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.590
Be wary of traps, Sasuke.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.680
Traps?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.550
Oh, that's not what I meant!

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.680
That's the Susano'o, right?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.550
Don't get too violent, Sasuke!

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.680
Remember, I told you not to kill him!

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.970
It seems he's acquired Orochimaru's power.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.380
He won't die so easily!

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.510
Sasuke!

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.930
The hood!

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.590
What?!

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.630
Why that—!

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.050
You're taking the shyness thing too far.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.680
First, you hide your face, and now your entire body?

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
Did you just molt to make a getaway?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.180
All you have is what you took from Orochimaru.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.680
You're still nothing!

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.510
Sasuke… You underestimate me.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.380
Well, then again, I was listed lower than you

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.380
on the danger scale in the Bingo Book…

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.760
And of course, I'm nothing compared to Lord Orochimaru.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.720
That's for sure.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.470
Especially if you consider this hiding.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.340
Sasuke, watch out!

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.840
There's chakra everywhere…

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.130
It's hard to tell which is the real one.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.840
It's the ability to transform one's flesh into liquid.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.300
To detach and separate using one's own life substance.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.430
That's why it looks like a shedding.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.380
I've researched and applied

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.130
the Hozuki Clan's Flesh Transforming ability to this technique.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.630
You know him, don't you? Suigetsu.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.050
He can transform from human to water, and back to human again.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.220
Plus, I have the amazing ability to recuperate quickly.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.130
I admit it's a healing technique that I studied

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.380
from the body of a woman originally from the Uzumaki Clan…

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.380
Someone you're quite familiar with… Karin.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.970
Karin's from the Uzumaki Clan?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.880
A special trait of those with Uzumaki blood is their red hair.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.050
And their life force is as tenacious as a cockroach's.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.840
Now then, you must be thinking

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.930
about the last member of your team.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.430
Or perhaps he's no longer your comrade?

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.260
You have a discerning eye since you chose those three.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.970
In the Shinobi World, those without talent are nothing.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.430
But those who lack talent can just steal it from those who do.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.800
Seems like you have Jugo's ability too…

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.470
Did you receive a Curse Mark from Orochimaru?!

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.760
No!

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.180
That is just a temporary boost.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.220
That memento is something I actually cultivated myself…

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.220
at Ryuchi Cave!

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.720
Ryuchi Cave?!

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.470
Impossible!

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.800
Yes, I found it!

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.470
A place as legendary as Mt. Myoboku, and the Shikkotsu Woods!

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.720
Lord Orochimaru is not the only one to have reached it.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.880
I went there… RYUCHI CAVE

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.010
and trained under the guidance of the White Snake Sage.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.380
And I was able to surpass Lord Orochimaru at long last.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.680
I did it!

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.300
Don't be impatient, Sasuke!

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.430
He dodged…that arrow?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.430
My sensory ability is better than it used to be.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.970
Nature Energy is my ally now.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.380
Nature Energy?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.380
I knew it. So he does have…

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.300
Listen… The members of Jugo's clan have always had

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.430
special bodies that absorbed Nature Energy.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.340
That's the secret behind those rampages.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.340
The ability causes them to suddenly become more wild and powerful.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.380
Lord Orochimaru wasn't interested in Jugo's rampages…

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.090
so much as the origin of his clan's power.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.550
And he finally found the source…

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.260
It was Ryuchi Cave.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.380
Lord Orochimaru immediately tried to acquire that power.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.550
But, he didn't yet possess a body that could tolerate it.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.510
That's why…

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.840
He couldn't become the perfect Sage…

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.010
that I have become!

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.760
I see… As expected… you're using Sage Mode power.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.930
You're just like Orochimaru!

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.800
A disgusting snake!

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.220
You ought to know better, you snake expert…

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.180
I'm no longer a snake.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.430
With my perfect Sage power, I've shed my snakeskin…

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.800
I am now a dragon!

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.340
Answer me.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.680
Would you like these clones to use Susano'o or not?

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.590
Your choice.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.340
The likes of you have no answer.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.300
Well, I'll answer for you.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.130
Impossible… Damn him!

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.510
They will use it.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.260
Damn them.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.300
Each one of us must take on five.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.430
Five to one… No, it's 25 to five.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.130
Lord Tsuchikage?

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.340
We'll guard each other's backs and coordinate attacks.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.380
We are the Five Kage!

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.510
– Yes! – That's right!

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.260
Let's go!

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.510
The Five Kage are struggling against Madara.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:02.720
There's unbelievable chakra!

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.680
He's not just a legendary shinobi… He's been reanimated.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.300
He's immortal, so he has infinite chakra.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.680
It's no wonder the Five Kage are having a hard time.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.220
We must do something about the user of this Reanimation Jutsu.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.380
Any word from the Investigative Unit?

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.340
Nothing. They've been searching every spot thought to be a hideout.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.430
And not one sign of Kabuto.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.590
And the Sensory Unit?

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.340
We're getting no response.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.470
He's probably put up a barrier.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.340
Shall I send out more shinobi?

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.720
We've sent every man available.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.300
Anymore will weaken the front.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.970
Who would have imagined that Kabuto could do so much?

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.840
Sage Art: White Extreme Attack!

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.720
My ears…

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.380
And my bones… They feel like they're being grated.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.130
It's a jutsu that uses light and sound

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.090
to impair vision and hearing…

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.380
A jutsu that causes the air to oscillate…

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.880
to paralyze the senses, freezing movement.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.550
A snake's cornea can block out the light

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.590
and by turning my flesh into fluid,

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.130
I can easily absorb the sound and vibration.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.260
The only one who can move freely under these conditions…

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.590
is me in Sage Mode!

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.340
It's no use!

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.050
We can't maintain Susano'o!

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.470
Yes, I should go for Itachi.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.880
I'll rewrite the Paper Seal in his head

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.340
and turn him into my pawn again.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.470
Or even better…

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:27.220
Itachi… It seems you always end up finding me.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.260
Can you sense my chakra?

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.380
But…wait a minute…

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.430
I'm impressed you were able to pass through my barrier,

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.090
and find this place.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.930
When you were controlling me,

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.050
I was able to pinpoint where your chakra was coming from.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.930
That's another risk of this jutsu.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.180
I remember you said, "when I was controlling you…"

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:58.050
So you can't sense my chakra now, can you?

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.430
You're trying to trick me with your lies again?

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.970
I never said I was the one

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.880
who was able to sense your chakra.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.800
Only Nagato could do that, and I was with him.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.050
I have no such ability.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.430
Besides, even now, I know what your target is anyway.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.380
I merely move to protect that which I think you'll most want to attack.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.510
If a man as cautious and opportunistic as you wants Sasuke…

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.470
you will go for him first.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.470
Your best chance to capture Sasuke is now,

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.590
before either of us figures out your jutsu.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.590
And after that, you could use Sasuke to manipulate me.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:49.180
What sets you apart from the rest of the Uchiha Clan

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.430
is that you have true Visual Prowess…

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.510
You have the ability to peer into and read people's souls.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.130
And use what you learn in battle.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.510
That is why you are so good at deceiving people…

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.880
You died lying in the first place,

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.590
that makes you a dirty lying ninja through and through!

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.630
He's on the ceiling!

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.430
You think a makeshift team of two

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:24.300
can outwit my perception skills?

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.800
And because your brother lied so much,

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.050
you know nothing about each other…

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.010
Sasuke…

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.970
Do you remember that time

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.970
you tagged along with me on my mission?

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.680
The wild boar?

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.590
I'm off.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.760
You…?!

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.510
Oh that, I remember.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.340
Wild boar…?

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.800
I'm off.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.840
You…?!

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.590
I heard you're going on a wild boar hunt, Big Brother!

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.760
I heard it's big like a monster.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.220
And it's bad, because it's tearing up the fields.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.430
Isn't that why you're going on the mission, to take it down?

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.430
And you're going alone, right?

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.970
But it's okay, since I'm coming with you.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.760
You know, right?

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.970
That I'm a good archer?

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.760
I've gone hunting with you often.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.010
Sorry, Sasuke. Next time.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.760
What?!

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.300
Big Brother!

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.720
Big Brother!

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.050
I'm surprised that you caught up.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.340
Well, I've been training…

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.130
Climb up here.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.630
Okay!

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:44.300
That's it, right?

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880
Don't kill it.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:46.720
Huh?

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.470
Just hurt it, and it will return to the mountain.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.550
Let's go.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.630
Yeah.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.090
Don't hit a vital spot.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.380
I know!

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.130
– Now! – Now!

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.050
He's going to steal my blade

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.680
and cut off his own tail to escape!

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.260
That's why he told you not to be so impatient.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.760
Oh that's right, I'd forgotten.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.760
I have horns here now.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.090
Big Brother…

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.550
You completely missed.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:29.800
Sorry, Big Brother…

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.260
You need more training.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.510
Let's go home, Sasuke.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.050
I'll help you train when we return.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.880
Okay!

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.630
Looks like you might be able

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.630
to take down that giant wild boar now.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.050
Instead of that giant wild boar,

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.300
we've got to take down that snake.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.630
Yeah…

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.380
I sympathize greatly with Itachi.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.260
Both Itachi and I worked for the good of the Leaf Village,

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.510
but in return, all we got back was dishonor and disgrace!

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.590
What in the world has the Leaf Village ever done for us?

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.470
No matter what darkness or contradictions lay

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.430
within the village, I am…

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.380
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "To Each Their Own Leaf"

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.180
I am still Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf!

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:08.300
TO EACH THEIR OWN LEAF Tune in again!
