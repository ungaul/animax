00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.940
Who are you aiming at?

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.570
You're too fast for our attacks!

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.530
I'll say it again.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.610
I am a Lightning Style User.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.860
When I arm myself with the Lightning Style,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.070
my speed and defensive power exceed the normal limits of my body.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.110
Unless you attack with the Wind Style,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.070
you will never be able to take me down.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.360
The trouble is, we can't land a blow even with that!

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.530
No, wait…

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.940
Wind Style Unit! Attack Formation C!

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.650
Right!
Here we go!

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.230
Humph! Instead of doing it quietly,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400
she announces how they're going to attack.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.610
Group Wind Style Jutsu!

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.530
Wind Style: Casting Net!

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.690
A wide-range jutsu to overtake my speed…

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.280
Splendid!

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.610
All right! We'll surround him all at once!

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.900
Paradox

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.480
No matter how many times we attack, there's no effect!

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.610
We haven't inflicted any damage!

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.780
Our only choice is to batter him with consecutive top-speed Blade Dance!

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.610
Is that you, Dodai?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.190
Yes.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.730
The Third Lord Raikage was a shinobi

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.610
blessed not only with strength and speed,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.690
but also with extraordinary physical resilience.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.530
Even long-distance Wind Style attacks, which should reach him,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.110
do not affect him.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.440
We need an even more powerful Wind Style User.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.820
I'm a pretty good Wind Style User myself.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.070
So how did he actually die?

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.480
In order to save his comrades…

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.860
He used himself as a decoy and faced 10,000 enemy troops alone.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.280
It's said he stood for three days and three nights

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.610
in order to buy enough time to let his comrades escape.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.400
I need this one to buy me some time…

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.860
while I finish summoning him.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.650
Guess I'll just have to take over.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.530
Honestly, among the Allied Forces,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.480
there isn't a stronger Wind Style User than me.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.320
There is!

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.440
It's me!

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.070
What?! Is that Naruto?! What is he doing here?

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.570
That feels like Wind Style! Is it a new Rasengan?

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.440
With this jutsu, it just might work if it hits!

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.110
No! That's not good enough!

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.440
Not with his Cloak of Lightning…

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.570
I know! Raikage are always super fast!

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.030
That's what he was aiming for!

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.650
It's no use! He dodged it again!

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.780
We have to distract him, or it won't hit him!

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.230
Okay! When it comes back…

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.610
At this distance…

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.190
It's gonna hit!

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.570
That Wind Style is strong!

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.400
This will work…

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.030
Now, Sealing Corps! Hurry!

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.980
Right!

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.400
All right!

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.570
W-What?!

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.230
Third Raikage… You are so strong, it's frightening…

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.530
I don't believe it.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.860
Rasen Shuriken didn't work?!

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.940
The look in Lord Raikage's eyes has changed…

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.610
He's been completely taken over.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.530
That's…?!

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.440
Everyone, get away from the Third Raikage!

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.530
Earth Style Shinobi, form a wall immediately!

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.900
Everyone, link up!

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.820
– Right! – Right!

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.610
– Earth Style: Great Mud Wall! – Earth Style: Great Mud Wall!

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.530
Disperse!

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.440
Come with me, Naruto!

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.900
Lava Style: Rubber Wall!

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.690
What the—?!

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.820
That was the Third Raikage's most lethal ninjutsu…

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.690
The Piercing Four-Fingered Thrust of Hell!

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.570
He accumulates Lightning Chakra in his fingertip and strikes…

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.530
This thrust technique complements the Lightning Style.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.780
Just like Kakashi Sensei's Lightning Blade and Sasuke's Chidori.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.820
Everyone, get as far away as possible, now!

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.940
No! If we know where he'll appear, we should aim for that spot all together!

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.610
Everyone, stand by!

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.730
It's payback time for all the times we missed!

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.690
Stop! Listen to the Cloud Shinobi!

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.980
Get him!

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:53.780
Damn it!

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.030
Fools!

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.610
He's switched to the Three-Fingered Assault!

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.030
What kind of jutsu is it anyway?

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.690
It's way too powerful!

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.940
He took dozens down in an instant, all by himself!

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.610
The fewer the fingers he uses, the more focused the energy and

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.780
the more powerful the Thrusts of Hell!

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.190
It's the Third's Invincible Spear!

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.900
And he can handle it with his impermeable body.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.610
It's his ultimate shield!

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.730
Is that old man even human…?

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.730
They say he is the only shinobi to have ever been able

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.440
to go head to head with a Tailed Beast, unarmored and unarmed!

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.730
No way!

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.530
Raikage are amazing!

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.070
Huh?

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.570
What's the matter?

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.440
So what's up with that?

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.570
With what?

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.610
Look at that… The scar on his chest!

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.610
If his body's the ultimate shield, how'd he get that?

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.780
He didn't even flinch against my Rasen Shuriken!

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:12.530
Oh, that…

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.980
Once, the Third Raikage helped everyone get away from the Eight Tails

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.730
by stopping its rampage all by himself.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.780
Then the Eight Tails hurt him?

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.190
He called that the most shameful incident of his life.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.650
One that he never spoke about…

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.820
Not even the Fourth Raikage knows.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.190
Okay, I get that ordinary attacks won't hurt him.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.570
But if he got hurt fighting the Eight Tails,

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.110
then the Eight Tails' strongest jutsu is…

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.530
Speaking of the Eight Tails…!

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.530
Tailed Beast Bomb!

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.530
What'll we do, Lady Temari?!

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.400
Even that hero, Naruto, couldn't take him down…

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.150
Huh?! Naruto?

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.150
You mean the hero of the Hidden Leaf?

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.980
Where? Where? Which one is he?

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.440
Where were you looking, Yukata?!

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.280
He's the one who just released that flashy Wind Style Jutsu!

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.230
Huh?!

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.280
But that guy's about the same age as us!

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.980
Yes! At his age, he managed to defeat Pain of the Akatsuki!

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.030
So how can we beat an enemy that even the hero of the Hidden Leaf can't?

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.440
That's what I'm trying to figure out right now!

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.570
You two can't use long-distance Wind Style!

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.780
So go away, it's dangerous!

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.110
– R-Right! – R-Right!

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.070
So what'll we do?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.440
Even Naruto's Rasengan couldn't inflict serious damage.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.190
How do we fight the Raikage?

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.730
We have to consider retreating.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.780
What a nuisance these Kage are… even one who's by himself.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.320
This is the ideal time since they're separated.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:28.190
If we retreat and allow him to join up with the other Kage, it will get worse.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.480
What to do? What to do?

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.570
W-What's this I'm feeling?

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.820
Is Naruto trying another jutsu or something?

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.440
Th-This is the Tailed Beast Bomb… The same as the Eight Tails'!

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.530
He's holding a mass of chakra this heavy in his human form?!

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.940
Is this even possible?

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.530
I figured it was impossible.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.400
What?! What happened?!

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.940
Damn it!

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.780
It still didn't work!

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.320
His cloak of chakra is gone.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.780
He overdid it…

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.610
Lady Temari!

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.570
The enemy has broken through our ranks! Many are hurt!

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.070
Everyone, hurry and gather the wounded!

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.530
Notify the Medical Team!

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.530
Tell all to maintain a standby position at a distance—!

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.610
Are you all right?!

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.780
Hey, hang on!

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.400
Hey, Bendy Guy!

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.690
I need to get a hold of Octopops and Eight Tails right away!

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.320
How do I reach them?!

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.730
Go through the Com Corps and

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.610
have Intel Unit Captain Inoichi Yamanaka connect you with Bee.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.820
I just have to look for a Com Corps Shinobi, huh?

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.230
You're in luck.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.110
Huh?!

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.190
I'm with the Com Corps.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.530
All right!

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.610
Naruto! Watch out!

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.820
He's withdrawn his Three-Fingered Assault!

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.190
He's aiming for a KO with a punch.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.110
Lava Style: Rubber Sphere!

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.030
Lord Dodai of the Hidden Cloud! What do you need?

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.110
Naruto needs to speak to Bee and Eight Tails.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.780
Please contact them immediately!

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.690
While the Third Raikage is still chasing after the dummy Rubber Ball!

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.480
He made it look like he had me inside that ball,

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.280
but he pulled me out and hid me behind a boulder!

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.980
Bendy Guy thinks fast!

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.530
Thanks, Bendy Guy!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.480
Now I'll have time to talk to Octopops!

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.030
He'll probably catch on right away!

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.360
Remember, you don't have much time!

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.530
Yeah!

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.820
Naruto, you want to talk to Bee and Eight Tails,

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.400
but aren't they nearby?

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.570
You're supposed to be working together.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.440
They're not here now. Besides…

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.480
Never mind, hurry and contact them please!

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.190
There's no time!

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.400
Naruto's gone on ahead!

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.400
Hurry up and finish your business!

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.980
How long is it going to take?!

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.400
The urge to go pee is beyond one's control…y'see?

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.030
Octopops, it's me, Naruto!

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.150
I have to ask Eight Tails something!

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.190
Put him on!

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.190
Relieving oneself takes concentration. So let me focus on urination.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.440
I can't talk now…

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.480
I'm here, Naruto! What's going on?

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.280
You seem to be in a panic!

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.650
Hey, Eight Tails…

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.480
You've fought the Third Raikage before, right?

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.440
Yeah, long ago.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.440
He was solid and could take the blows.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.230
Once, he used this move called the One-Fingered Assault

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.400
and cut off all my tails.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.940
How did you manage to scar Gramps Raikage on the chest?

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.610
Huh?!

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.480
Maybe it was my Tailed Beast Bomb?

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.150
No, maybe it wasn't…

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.440
We were pushing against each other with all our might,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.610
and we both fell forward.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.780
I don't quite remember.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.070
Maybe…

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.030
Hey thanks, Eight Tails!

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.980
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.690
What? Is this different from the one earlier?!

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.820
Gramps Raikage is headed this way.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.150
When he gets here, get out of the way, Bendy Guy!

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.730
There's something I want to try.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.480
Got it.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.360
Rasengan!

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.650
Everyone! Do not assist!

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.530
Sealing Corps! Stand by!

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:06.480
Right!

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.280
I don't know what he's planning,

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.230
but that's just a Rasengan!

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.730
Is that going to be enough?

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.360
His Invincible Spear will cut through Naruto's arms and legs.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.440
I'll have him brought back to me half-dead.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.400
Sage Mode: Frog Kumite!

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.110
With this, I can sense danger over a wider range, and it's faster!

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.940
So I'll be able to counter at the last minute…

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.230
And aim straight for his arm!

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.150
Just like I thought!

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.940
I see… That's how he got that scar on his chest!

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.570
– We did it! – We did it!

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.610
All right! Way to go, Naruto!

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.650
Yes!

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.070
That was sharp of you!

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.280
Eight Tails told me that they were pushing as hard as they could,

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.690
then fell forward.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:42.190
I figured that he must've fallen on his own hand.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.400
He injured himself. That's why it was so embarrassing.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.400
He was the shinobi with the ultimate spear and shield…

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.730
What a paradox.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.860
Lord Third's spear was stronger, it seems… Yeah!

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.860
Probably the shinobi with the greatest shield is Gaara!

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.730
I always knew you'd be Tsuchikage.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:25.480
But look at you now… An old man riddled with back pain.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.110
I'll admit that was a punch with some power to it…

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.610
but you overdid it and strained your back!

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.860
Anyway! Hurry up and run!

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.730
I'm about to use the Hozuki Clan's Water Gun Jutsu!

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.400
You were cooperative until just now!

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.570
What happened? Have you decided to side with the enemy?

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.690
I am a former Kage, after all.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.190
I am helping you out… Just in a different way.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.230
Which is what exactly?

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.280
If you can't win against me using all of your abilities,

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.610
that means you're less than dead old me, you fool!

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.440
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Terror: The Steam Imp"

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.730
How are you gonna win against the enemy boss like that?! TERROR: THE STEAM IMP

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:09.400
TERROR: THE STEAM IMP Tune in again!
