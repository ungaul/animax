WEBVTT

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.540
The Promise That Was Kept

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.370
I will never go over to your side!

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.960
I have no regrets with my path up until now.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.410
I told you I saw everything.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.500
So…

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.790
don't…

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.790
keep imagining yourself as Hokage!

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.910
The person Rin wanted to watch over isn't the current you…

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.370
It was Obito Uchiha.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.710
We're late again because of you…Obito.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.330
Let's go, Obito.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.040
Sorry! We'll be right there.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.460
Rin…

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.330
That's right…

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.910
You ought to fill in that hole in your heart yourself…

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.370
Others will be of no help.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.210
So…come over here.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.790
I won't ignore you.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.410
Come… Come… Obito… Hold on, Rin!

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.160
That's right… Rin won't even turn to look at the current you.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.750
The one Rin wanted to watch over is Obito Uchiha.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.910
Enough already…

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.330
I am…

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.540
Obito Uchiha!

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.410
Now just come over, you bastard!

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.370
Everyone's power…

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.540
Don't you dare underestimate it!

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.660
They're out!

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.870
– All right! – We did it!

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.910
– We did it! – We did it!

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.290
Yes!

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.500
Did I…lose?

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.910
The gaping hole of hell that has opened

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.080
will be filled by the moon's dreams…

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.040
There's nothing in my heart!

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.580
I don't even feel pain anymore.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.660
Don't feel so guilty, Kakashi.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.080
This hole was opened by this hellish world.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.040
Do you really think that something like this

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.410
can fill that hole in your heart?!

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.660
Don't erase the memories of the real Rin!

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.500
Rin sacrificed herself to protect and save the village!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.580
You can try and fill that hole with delusions all by yourself…

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.710
But that hole will never be filled!

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.710
The hole in one's heart gets filled by others around you.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.710
Let's go.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.540
Rin…

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.540
You kept your promise, Naruto Uzumaki!

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.500
That's why I want to save you too…

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.540
And you really rescued us!

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.330
Right, Son!

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.250
We were lucky.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.080
He did it.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.830
For real.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.160
You're right.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.250
I'm so glad!

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.410
Isn't he…?

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.250
H-Hey!

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.950
Wait, Sasuke!

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.200
Where is he?! Where'd he go?!

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.080
Over there! He's still alive!

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.790
Right…I've lost…

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.200
Kakashi!

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.040
Sasuke, we'll talk later.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.200
I apologize for appearing so suddenly…

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.410
But I was once his classmate and friend…

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.870
So please let me take responsibility for him.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.250
Kakashi Sensei!

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.700
He's now—!

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.160
Dad!

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.540
He's weak now!

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.950
Now's the time to finish him!

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.750
Let's go!
– Right! – Right!

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.410
Hold it!

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:04.750
Obito…

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.450
When we had that chakra tug-of-war just now,

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.330
I got to see inside your heart.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.250
It seems like my son nagged and lectured you quite a bit.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.660
I think he might have gotten that from his mother.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.750
Dad…

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.370
But that duty actually falls… on you.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.950
I think the one who truly understands Obito

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.000
and should talk to him…

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.660
is you, his friend…Kakashi.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.250
Isn't that right, Naruto?

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.200
Naruto, you two and the Allied Forces should go

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.330
and help Lord First, and seal Madara away.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.250
Oh, right! We still need to deal with him!

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.330
Let's go, Sasuke!

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.700
I think you were younger than Naruto is now.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.580
Do you remember?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.250
All the missions that the four of us went on?

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.750
As a Medic Ninja, Rin did her utmost to protect you two.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.200
She would never have wished for a situation like this.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.500
But what caused this is my responsibility.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.000
Can I start explaining the mission to you?

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.370
We're close to the border.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.500
All right, it's this line.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.450
It shows where the Land of Earth is currently invading

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.290
the Hidden Grass Village.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.200
Hidden Stone Shinobi are our enemies…

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.910
We have received intel that 1000 ninja

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.910
already make up the front line.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.160
They've advanced farther than last time.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.620
The Land of Fire shares borders with the Hidden Grass.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.120
We should have stepped in long ago.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.910
Judging by the size of this advance…

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.700
they must have an efficient system for reinforcement.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.080
Hence, our mission is here… at Kannabi Bridge.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.040
To crush one's enemy at the battlefront

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.950
requires an immense number of ninja.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.830
So shinobi like us, who focus on sabotage missions,

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.910
are forced to work in small, select teams.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.160
The bridge…you say?

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.200
Then it's an infiltration mission?

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.790
Team Kakashi…

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.200
Your mission is to infiltrate the enemy's rear territory.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.450
You will destroy this bridge

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.830
which is used to transport supplies and reinforcements.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.870
And when this is done, withdraw immediately.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.790
– Yes, sir! – Yes, sir!

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:27.410
And you, Sensei?

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.000
I will face the enemy directly on the battlefront.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.250
I'll create a diversion for you.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.250
In any case, Kakashi is your captain today.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.500
We'll travel together to the border,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.330
but after that your mission commences!

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.830
– Yes, sir! – Yes, sir!

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.700
We'll be splitting up into two teams from this point.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.200
Good luck to you all.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.950
The enemy the other day was doing surveillance alone.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.250
But here on out, we'll be fighting teams.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.500
Be careful…

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.200
Let's get going, Captain.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.790
It's no coincidence that I, who should be dead,

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.040
am standing before you two like this.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.330
Perhaps it was Rin who made it happen…

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.620
Her way of scolding me for failing as your teacher.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.200
I'm sorry I couldn't protect Rin.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.700
Rin…

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.040
Rin was my only light and hope.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.000
After I lost Rin…

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.040
The world as I saw it, changed.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.580
It became a pitch black hell.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.540
There's no hope in this world.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.370
I took Madara's identity and walked the world.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.080
But all it did was confirm my belief.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.200
Even with my Sharingan, I couldn't see anything…

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.950
There was nothing to see.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.620
I don't know anything for sure either…

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.290
Then…my new path is—!

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.830
Without a doubt, your path is just one of many.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.950
And it may not actually be wrong either.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.910
I've thought this world was hell too.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.290
I thought that you had died…

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.000
And right after that, I lost Rin…

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.200
And I lost Minato Sensei as well.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.160
But…

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.540
Oh yeah… I forgot…

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:25.200
I was the only one who didn't give you a gift…

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
for becoming a Jonin, Kakashi.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.410
I was wondering… what to give you…

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.870
and I just had a thought.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.200
Don't worry…

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.250
It's not some useless, extra baggage…

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:58.410
I'm giving you…my Sharingan.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:08.870
Whatever the village may say, you are a great Jonin.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.200
That's how I really feel…

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.910
So please accept it.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.950
Even though I don't know anything for sure…

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.370
I tried my best to see the world with this eye.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.870
I felt that as long as I had your Sharingan and words…

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.540
I could see it.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.250
And what you saw is Naruto?

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.370
How can you be sure his path won't fail?

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.450
No…

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.290
He may very well fail too. Of course.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.370
How is Naruto different from me?

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.870
Why do you go so far for him?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.200
Because I can say without hesitation

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.290
that he is less likely to fail than the current you.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.450
Why is that?!

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:11.160
Because if he trips and stumbles on his path…

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.160
I'll help him.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.790
Why would you help him?

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:35.250
He would never give up on his dreams…or on reality.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.290
That's the kind of guy he is.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:39.950
Found him!

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.120
And the way he forges ahead draws others towards him.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.040
He makes you want to reach out when he's about to stumble.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.750
And the greater the support behind you,

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.660
the closer you can get to your goal.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.330
That's the difference.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.950
Massive Rasen Shuriken!

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.870
Bigger! We'll go with something even bigger!

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.950
– Right! – Right!

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.120
Do you really believe such a thing is possible

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.160
in this pitch-black hell?

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.250
I'm sure you could've seen it too, if you had tried.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.250
After all, you and I have the same eyes.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.700
If comrades that you trust, gather around you…

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.200
hope can take physical form and become visible.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.410
That's what I believe…

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.200
Obito.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.120
Naruto Uzumaki, huh?

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.660
Seems you've become friends with that Fox Demon's brat, Gaara…

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.870
If you're not going to help, let's talk later.
