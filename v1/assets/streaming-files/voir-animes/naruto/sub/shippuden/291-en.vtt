WEBVTT

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.440
It's no use.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.240
Shikamaru, you must come to your senses.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.070
Forget it!

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.580
I hate to be woken up when I'm having a good sleep!

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.090
Cloud of Suspicion

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.960
Silver-4c, pawn-3f, rook-4b, rook-4h,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.300
bishop-3f, pawn-1f, pawn-1d, pawn-2f, king-6b…

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.680
King-6h, king-7b, king-7h, silver-6b…

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.940
You're really hanging in there.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.870
The average shinobi would have given up long ago.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm busy playing shogi with past masters.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.250
I don't have time to get bored.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.080
I like your stubbornness.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.090
You can learn a lot from shogi.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.630
No matter what position you're in, there's always a way out.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.180
Are you planning on getting out of this situation?

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.010
I look forward to seeing that.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.810
Hey, can you at least give me back my lighter?

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.770
I just can't calm down without it.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.110
Sure, when you decide to accept Lord Gengo's beliefs.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.070
Why would you follow a guy like that?

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.360
Let's just say I found the place where I belong.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.160
And that wasn't the Hidden Leaf Village?

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.370
Weren't you a member of Team 7?

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.990
Then why didn't Naruto come?

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.120
You and I aren't close, so why did you come?

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.250
Naruto knows nothing about this situation.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.380
This was all my decision.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.340
Even still, if this had been Sasuke or Sakura,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.390
surely Naruto would have come…

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.970
I bet Gengo put those ideas in your head, right?

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.730
There's no doubt that Gengo controls people with words.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.850
So why don't you snap out of it and wake up?

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.860
I woke up a long time ago.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.990
When Lord Gengo gave me a will.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.530
Wait.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.620
Do you still have more to say?

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.330
I promise… I'm gonna undo Gengo's jutsu and save you.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.880
I'd resign myself if I were you.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.130
Otherwise, things will get much worse.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.970
You're a member of the Hidden Leaf.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.520
Don't forget that!

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.070
Pawn-4e, bishop-3c…

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.500
Knight-3g… Nope… I don't have enough pieces right now.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.410
The king's gonna get away.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.500
Ro! Is that you?!

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.720
That voice…is it you Lord Shikamaru?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.880
Hey Gengo!

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.800
These guys were just obeying my orders!

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.970
If you're gonna kill someone, kill me!

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.230
Remember, as long as you live, there's a chance.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.900
Don't give up!

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.860
I won't let you give up and die!

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.530
Worry not.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.030
This is nothing…

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.570
What happened to Soku? Wasn't she with you?

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.330
She's okay, isn't she?!

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.000
Why do you insist on serving Feudal Lords

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.880
and incompetent people who oppress you?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.800
Like, that's none of your business!

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.720
Remember… The way that those people looked at you.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.640
What did you see deep inside their eyes?

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.930
Like, I don't remember!

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.470
Sure, you do.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.390
The truth is, it's stuck to your mind and won't go away. Isn't that so?

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.850
Remember!

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.020
The eyes that looked at you.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.240
The suspicious eyes that feared me,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.700
and tried to discriminate against me…

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.830
Why must you give your proud and mighty life for people like that?

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.920
Why pledge loyalty to those who hold you in bondage?

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.880
They are using me.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.710
Everyone is an enemy.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.800
There is nothing to fear.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.840
Now, turn.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.010
And accept everything.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.230
A will has just been granted.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.640
I've brought him, Lord Gengo…

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.930
My apologies for the inhospitable treatment.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.940
As you know, I can't let down my guard.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.980
I have no intention of speaking to you.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.150
It's obvious you're trying to control me with your words.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.400
You're starting to look like your father.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.450
Forgive me, but I looked into your background.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.950
Your family and friends…

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.910
And the fact that you came here to kill me.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.790
Why do you people keep oppressing us?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.880
When did we do that?

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.300
This land is feeble.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.300
We barely have natural resources and the ground is fallow,

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.390
yet we are trying our hardest to survive. That is all.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.680
Yeah right, all the while you're gathering up Rogue Ninja…

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.980
What's your motive?

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.060
Are you planning on starting a war?

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.150
I'm not gathering them.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.900
They come to me, seeking salvation.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.740
Salvation?!

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.620
Have you never questioned the current existence of shinobi?

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.450
Without war,

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.580
they are no more than hunting dogs for Feudal Lords and the rich.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.910
Is that truly a fitting life for a shinobi?

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.080
What is it that you're trying to say?

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:52.130
They come here because they want to be real shinobi.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.340
The alliance of nations to maintain a dark peace…

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.180
and bind shinobi with meaningless laws.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.810
But there will always be those who reject it.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.190
This land is merely the gathering place for them.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.360
Various rules are necessary to preserve peace.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.940
The peace you speak of is nothing but a theory,

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.820
forced upon us by the Great Nations.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.200
The Tailed Beasts that you keep are proof of that.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.910
Had you used one,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.080
this land would be completely helpless.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.700
Isn't that so?

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.130
We have no intention of ever using a Tailed Beast for war again.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.960
You keep the Tailed Beast to yourselves,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.300
and you expect us to believe that?

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.970
Isn't that the biggest excuse by the Great Nations?

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.800
Quit jumping to conclusions.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.390
Then how about this?

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.470
Give this land a Tailed Beast too.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.600
I'm sure the Hidden Cloud has an extra one, correct?

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.980
Then we wouldn't worry, and we would believe you.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.820
You know we can't do that.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.650
Of course not.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.030
You espouse peace openly…

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:04.120
but deep down, you don't trust small countries like ours.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.910
But you can't make the argument for war because of that.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.250
There's got to be another solution.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.840
You need another solution?

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.550
Come with me.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.470
I'd like to show you something…

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:49.790
What is this?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.590
Agricultural crops can't grow at our elevation.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.880
The people live in poverty with little to eat.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.800
If we just had some kind of product,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.550
something to add value to their lives…

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.220
This flower is the result of selective breeding.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.690
You've seen it here and there, haven't you?

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.730
But it was all for nothing…

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.820
This flower wilts the moment it's taken out of this village,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.030
due to its unique environment.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.910
Why did you choose the way of the shinobi?

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.870
Was it to file away documents for the rest of your life?

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.660
Who knows.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.420
Most likely not.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.500
You train daily to hone your skills.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.300
And with your skills, you defeat the enemy,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.220
to protect what is precious.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.850
That is the way a shinobi should live.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.470
That is the way your father and mentor lived.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.770
How would you know?!

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.610
You probably hope that you can measure up to them someday.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.780
But in a world of peace, can you really accomplish that?

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.450
It is because of war,

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.080
that shinobi abilities underwent remarkable development.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.830
If there had been continual peace,

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.880
even you would never have spent such worthwhile moments with your friends.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.710
Am I wrong?

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.850
If that's the price for peace,

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.310
I'll gladly throw down my weapons.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.850
You're not speaking from your heart.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.400
You feel your own abilities weakening, don't you?

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.030
Shikamaru…

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.910
Shut up!

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.240
Stay out of this.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.250
Do not fear, Shikamaru.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.120
Put your hand down.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.050
Yes, that's it.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.630
First, why don't you calm down?

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.430
Take a deep breath.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.810
Do you like it?

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.770
The scent of my precious flowers?

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.850
Come on.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.940
I get it… So, that's it.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.280
The scent of certain flowers has the effect of stirring up memories.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.080
So, that's what you've been using to brainwash people.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.750
What inconceivable will…

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.920
But that discovery won't get you anywhere.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.040
You cannot disobey me.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.300
Where are my comrades?! Where are Ro and Soku?!

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.010
Bring them here!

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.340
We are right here.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.300
Huh?! You two?!

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.810
Like, Lord Gengo has given us the will...

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.280
Find him! Don't let him escape from this castle!

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.380
Shikamaru, it's useless to hide.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.720
I'm still numb… Damn it, Soku!

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.810
I can't use my Shadows.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.730
My rook and bishop two-piece handicap is gone too.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.810
The situation is bleak.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.780
It's unlike you…

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.820
I can't believe you'd go with the Climbing Silver.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.450
It's using an advance unit to break through enemy lines.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.540
You have to be ready to use tactics like this once in a while…

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.710
If I escape now, the risk for the Hidden Leaf will increase.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.750
That's what you told me back then.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.800
So, I guess that time has come for me.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.680
Calm down.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.640
There's still a chance an opportunity will present itself.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.190
Shikamaru, presently, you are the knight.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.730
Breaking through the enemy camp with a Climbing Silver or…

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.440
perhaps a knight that jumps high…

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.120
Guess I have no choice

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.660
but to jump back into the den of the king.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.960
Lord Gengo, are you sure it's all right

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.880
to leave the search for Shikamaru to Sai?

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.840
Like, it will be bad is he gets out of the castle.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.300
Don't panic.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.180
If he gets cornered, he's the type

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:04.020
to throw himself into an even more difficult situation.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.900
Isn't that right, Shikamaru?

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.110
You knew I was here?

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.360
That's no fun.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.870
You wouldn't leave this behind.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.490
You came back just for that?

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.910
You're something.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.120
Resign yourself and be captured!

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.840
If the floor won't work, there's always the ceiling.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.270
Below.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.600
My body…

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.770
Whoa… Lord Shikamaru, release me!

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.360
To break a genjutsu,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.780
the theory is to bring down the one who placed it.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.910
What do you say, Gengo?

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.950
Impossible.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.700
No one can resist my words.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.580
Ro…

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.210
Sorry, but you'll have to be my shield for a while.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:04.960
Shoot.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.670
Don't worry about hitting Ro.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:07.880
Go ahead and shoot.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.420
Just make sure you aim straight.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.720
Stop, Shikamaru.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.560
You cannot resist my voice.

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.520
Don't tell me you—?!

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.350
You purposely let Soku hit you in the ear

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.810
to dull your sense of hearing?!

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.150
This is the knight's jump!

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.950
I'm disappointed, Shikamaru.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.500
So disappointed.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.830
Please stay back, Lord Gengo.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.790
Leave this to me.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.170
Well done!

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.920
Gengo!

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.960
You won't get away!

00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:59.800
Damn it!

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.200
Damn it, you keep getting beaten up by girls.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.530
Weren't you going to become a better leader

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.410
for the sake of your comrades?

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.080
Dad… I…

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.920
I'm just not cut out to be a shinobi.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.800
Is he dead?

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.720
I didn't like, kill him yet.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.640
Well, he had no chance at the end.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.060
How pitiful…

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.520
I'm physically at my limit.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.940
The air feels so heavy.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.320
Man, this is such a drag.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.740
Are you okay, Shikamaru?

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.750
Don't you dare die on us!

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.210
You guys?!

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.800
But what're you doing here?

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.630
Oh, I get it. I'm still dreaming… Shikamaru!

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.390
T-Temari?!

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.050
I expect a lot more from you!

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.760
Why're you just sitting around dazed like that?!

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.470
Shikamaru?!

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.810
Stop it, Temari!

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.770
He'll really die.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:32.940
Shut up!

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.770
That's for lying to me at the Allied Forces meeting.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.820
Sorry, Temari.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.410
Thanks to you, I've come to my senses.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.910
Shikamaru!

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.160
Sorry, but can you take over here?

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.790
I have one more guy to take down.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.710
Is that Gengo?!

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.750
How did you know?

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.880
Lord Hokage told me.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.460
I had a hell of a time trying to get it out of him.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.180
I don't want to even imagine what you did.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.480
So, Shikamaru, it's okay to crush these guys?

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.230
They're brainwashed, but they're comrades.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.110
Please wake them up as well!

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.730
Like, shut your mouth.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.860
Wait!

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.030
You're forgetting one thing.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.370
He probably knows you're coming and has laid traps.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.040
I hope the odds of your winning in that condition is good.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.080
I have no intention of being a sacrificial pawn.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.880
All right then!

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:53.730
Okay, let's get on with our final moves…

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.060
Gengo!

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.810
TO BE CONTINUED

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.000
The Hidden Leaf still holds that much importance to you?

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.170
Damn right!

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.050
Then I'll let you in on something good…

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.470
What would you think if I said I've sent my comrades

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.550
with the will I bestowed upon them, into all of the Hidden Villages?

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.220
What did you say?

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:03.190
"Next time on Naruto Shippuden: Shikamaru's Story, A Cloud Drifting in the Silent Dark, Part 5: Dawn"

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.770
You don't have the means to stop it!

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:29.010
Tune in again!
