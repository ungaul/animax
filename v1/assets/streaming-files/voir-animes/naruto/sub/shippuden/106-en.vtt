WEBVTT

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.670
The attack of the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon 16 years ago.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.000
Suspicion fell on them.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.870
That the Uchiha had revolted and sought to take power.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.770
As a result,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.730
the Uchiha was put under the strict surveillance of the Anbu Black Ops,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.100
and they were forced to relocate to the outskirts of the village.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.670
They became totally estranged.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.600
Their distrust bred hatred and eventually,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.130
their suspicions became reality.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.000
The Uchiha clan plotted a coup d'état to take over the village...

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.870
The higher-ups in Hidden Leaf Village planted a spy within the Uchiha clan.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.370
That spy was your older brother...

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.800
Itachi Uchiha.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.070
From that moment, Itachi's suffering began.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.970
A coup d'état by the Uchiha?

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.100
Itachi was...a spy?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.670
Despite being an Uchiha, you were kept in the dark.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.530
Because you were still young.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.030
But it's all true...

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.800
Your father, Fugaku, was the mastermind behind the plot.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.630
And your brother, Itachi, was ordered by your father

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.770
to spy on the Anbu Black Ops.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.830
Itachi... You also serve as the Uchiha clan's pipeline

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.700
to the Village nerve center.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.470
You know that, don't you?

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.630
However...it was actually the opposite.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.470
Itachi was working for the village,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.200
feeding them information about the Uchiha.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370
He was what they call a double agent.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.700
You can't even imagine what a heavy burden that is to bear.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.530
Why?! Why did Itachi betray the Uchiha?

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.130
It may be hard for you to understand,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.170
not having witnessed the horrors of war.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.370
The Third Great Ninja War...

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.100
When Itachi was merely four years old,

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.270
he witnessed the deaths of many people.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.500
He was too young to experience war.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.830
War is hell...

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.770
That trauma made Itachi a pacifist who hated war.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.870
He was a man who put the village's safety first,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.970
and who strove to preserve peace.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.530
Instead of being bound by obligation to his clan,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.500
he was a ninja who loved his village.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.530
And the village higher-ups preyed on that trait.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.370
They assigned him to a top-secret mission.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.630
An eye for an eye...

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.730
For them to oppose the Uchiha, they would need the Sharingan.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.270
Yes.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.370
The mission was...

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.230
The total annihilation of the Uchiha clan.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.130
I can't even begin to imagine what he went through emotionally.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.400
Itachi was forced to make a terrible choice.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.270
The impossible choice of killing one's own brethren.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.770
But a civil war started by the likes of the Uchiha would shake

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.330
the very foundations of Hidden Leaf Village and the Land of Fire.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.130
Other nations would waste no time in seizing the opportunity to attack.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.730
It could even trigger a Fourth Great Ninja War...

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.770
The Uchiha clan's self-interest would involve innocent people

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.900
who had nothing to do with the ninja world.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.770
And countless people would die once again.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.530
If you were Itachi, what would you have done?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.070
So Itachi made up his mind.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.730
He himself would bring the curtain down on his clan.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.670
He did not hate the Uchiha nor did he betray them.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.630
It was inevitable.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.970
The discrimination by the village... and the object of their antagonism...

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.330
He shouldered the blame all by himself.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.200
No one can ever question Itachi's decision and the sacrifice he made.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.800
To be truthful, back then, even I anticipated war.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.730
I was bitter towards Senju's Hidden Leaf Village as well as the Uchiha.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.800
But Itachi was even aware of that.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.970
He alone was aware of my existence.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.100
Itachi sought to contact me and made certain conditions.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.500
In exchange for guiding me in my vendetta against the Uchiha,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.930
I was not to lay a hand on the village.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.270
He would help me kill our brethren...

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.770
But the Third Hokage tried a different hand.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.570
He tried to approach the Uchiha for a compromise.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.070
But time ran out, and his efforts failed.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.930
Leading to that night.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.670
It was a mission.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.000
To be the sole perpetrator of his clan's slaughter

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.600
and become a Rogue Ninja with his reputation in tatters.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.230
All of that was his mission.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.170
And Itachi completely fulfilled his duty...

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.870
With one exception...

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.900
He could not bring himself... to kill his younger brother.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.600
Truth After that, Itachi appealed to the Third Hokage

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.170
to protect you from Danzo and the higher-ups.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.200
Then he threatened Danzo and left the village.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.870
If he laid a hand on Sasuke,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.630
he would leak every detail about the village to unallied nations.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.230
Above all else, he was concerned about you.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.430
And yet he couldn't tell you the full truth.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.700
He had no choice but to say the things he did.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.630
It's a lie...

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.570
This isn't like you, Big Brother... It can't be...

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.170
I acted like the older brother you desired...

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.030
in order to measure your vessel.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.730
You will become a rival to measure my vessel against...

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.600
You have that hidden potential.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.100
You've been jealous of me and resented me.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.500
You've harbored hopes of surpassing me.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.130
That is why I am allowing you to live. For my sake...

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.730
My foolish little brother...

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.700
If you wish to kill me, resent me, hate me.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.000
And survive...in obscurity.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.670
Run...keep running... and cling to life.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.170
Then one day,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.630
come before me with the same eye that I possess.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:55.930
By making revenge your goal, he hoped to make you strong.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.530
The Uchiha is a proud clan of the Hidden Leaf.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.170
He wanted you to keep believing that.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.670
He beseeched the Hokage that you never learn the truth.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.100
And from the moment he left the village,

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.900
he was resolved to fighting you, and dying.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.800
So that he could instill in you a new power.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.630
That is Itachi's truth.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.130
No, you're lying.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.700
They must be lies.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.430
That's nonsense...

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.800
He almost killed me several times!

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.800
If Itachi wished it, he would have. Without a doubt.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:53.870
He even used the Mangekyo Sharingan to try to kill me!

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.200
That's why...!

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.130
Your battle was part of his plan.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.600
Itachi needed to pressure you in that fight.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.070
The reason for that...

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.370
Well, you probably realized it too, haven't you?

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.370
Finally, it comes out...

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.970
He freed you of the curse mark.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.670
And the death of someone closest to you...

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.070
It was a battle to awaken your Mangekyo.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.770
It was a battle that Itachi planned entirely for your sake.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.030
He pretended to be after your eyes until the very end.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.200
It's starting to sink in, I see...

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.770
You are lying.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.900
The one who made the Nine-Tails attack the village was you, Madara!

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.600
Itachi said so.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.600
Sixteen years ago,

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.100
Madara instigated the Nine-Tails' attack on Hidden Leaf Village.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.170
But that too was foiled by the Fourth Hokage.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.100
In short...

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.900
Madara is a bitter, defeated loser...

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.230
He is not worthy of becoming the best among the Uchiha.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.200
I am the one...

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.430
who shall surpass Madara and become the ultimate ninja!

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.300
You framed the Uchiha!

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.670
And you teamed up with Itachi to toy with the clan!

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.430
Itachi was lying when he told you that.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.800
Itachi feared that you would somehow learn the truth.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.100
He wanted to make absolutely certain there was no chance of that.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.270
He lied to make sure you would not trust me...

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.670
Not only that, he implanted Amaterasu in your eyes.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.630
As if I'd believe you!

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.900
He... Itachi was evil!

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.730
He's a criminal who killed his clan and joined Akatsuki!

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.100
Itachi took sole responsibility for an unspeakable crime

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.570
and left the village.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.870
Then he found a way to join Akatsuki and watched over

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.730
an organization that was dangerous to the village from the inside.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.700
He was always thinking about Hidden Leaf Village.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.030
And he thought of you...

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.800
When the Third Hokage, who had promised to protect you, died...

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.970
Itachi made an appearance in Hidden Leaf Village.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:53.500
It was to tell Danzo and the other superiors that "I am alive."

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.500
You were foremost in his thoughts--

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.670
Stop! Lies! They're all lies...

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.170
You're still alive, aren't you?

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:16.670
In order to survive, we cling to all we know and understand.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.700
And we label it reality.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.200
But knowledge and understanding are ambiguous.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.770
That reality could be an illusion.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.630
All humans live with the wrong assumptions.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.930
Isn't that another way of looking at it?

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.900
That Sharingan... How much can you actually see?

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.470
My eye is not like it was in the past!

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.130
My Sharingan can see through genjutsu!

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.930
Humph... You still speak with such confidence.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.330
But for now, I'll take your word for it.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.000
Your eyes did not perceive a single thing about Itachi.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.070
You were not able to see through the illusion Itachi created at all.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.930
Itachi killed his friends, his superiors...

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.700
He killed his lover, his father and his mother.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.630
But he could not kill...his little brother.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.970
He cried tears of blood and

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.970
killed every shred of feeling he had inside him,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.630
then he killed his brethren for the sake of his village.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.100
But he just couldn't kill you.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.870
Do you understand what that means?

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.570
To him, your life... was more precious than the village.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.830
Until the moment of his death...

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.900
No, even in death, it was all for you.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.670
To pass on a new power...

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.270
By making you defeat him, he had avenged the Uchiha clan.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.830
In order to raise and make you the hero of Hidden Leaf Village.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:20.030
His body was ravaged by illness and he knew he was near death.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.630
Even if he had to rely on drugs to prolong his life...

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.270
For the sake of his beloved little brother...

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.130
He had to fight you... and die in your presence.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.800
For the peace of Hidden Leaf Village, and most of all, for Sasuke Uchiha.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.400
He wanted to die as a criminal and a traitor.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.700
He accepted disgrace in the place of honor,

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.100
and hate in the place of love.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.630
And despite that, Itachi died with a smile on his face.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.100
He entrusted the Uchiha name to you, his younger brother,

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.230
deceiving you to the very end.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:21.970
I'm home.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.730
Welcome home, Big Brother!

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.030
Play with me, Big Brother!

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.770
Huh? What'll we play?!

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.970
Sasuke!

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.630
Your brother has Academy homework to do.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.370
You can play after he's done.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.170
Huh?

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.930
That's okay. I can do my homework later.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.500
It's easy anyway.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.330
Goodness...

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.130
Where could Big Brother be hiding?

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.930
Found you, Big Brother.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.900
You're pretty sharp, Sasuke.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.430
However...too bad.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.530
Ah! No fair!

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.870
Say, Father... Hmm?

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.330
Brother and I were playing hide-and-seek today,

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.100
but Big Brother used Clone Jutsu to run away.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.000
That's not fair, is it?

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.430
Hmm... You're able to do the Clone Jutsu already?

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.870
Big Brother, teach me the Clone Jutsu too, after dinner!

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.430
Homework!

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.000
Sorry, Sasuke. Let's do it some other time.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.870
Sasuke. It's time to go.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.600
You said that you would teach me a new shuriken jutsu.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.830
I have an important mission tomorrow that I must prepare for.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.570
You're a liar...

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.770
Sorry, Sasuke. Maybe some other time.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.530
Big Brother, watch this!

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.300
Hey! Don't be reckless...

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.900
Big Brother... Will you train with me again?

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.200
Yeah...

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.830
But I'm assigned to missions and starting tomorrow,

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.770
you will be attending the Ninja Academy.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.900
We won't have much time to spend together.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:37.730
That's okay.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.130
As long as you can stay with me once in a while.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.800
But, we only have each other as siblings.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.570
Even if it's only as an obstacle for you to overcome.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.370
Big Brother...

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.130
Can you help me with shuriken training today?

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.430
I'm busy. You should ask Father to teach you.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.730
But you're better than Father when it comes to shuriken jutsu.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.570
Even a kid like me can see that.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.300
Oww.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.000
Sorry, Sasuke... Some other time.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.230
Even if it's only as an obstacle for you to overcome...

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.070
I'm always going to be there for you.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.530
Even if you do hate me...

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.430
That's what big brothers are for.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.500
Sorry, Sasuke...

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.800
This is it.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.700
We are no longer "Hebi."

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:47.230
From this day on, our team will be "Taka."

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.270
Taka has only one goal.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.170
We...

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.570
will destroy the Hidden Leaf.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.100
The light hurts my eyes...

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:40.830
Noon already?

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.600
Damn it, bastard! Screw you, man!

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.900
Training from the morning, stomach so starving,

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.870
Rap-loving weirdo, that's what I am.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.330
Lunch menu Suikiyaki for sure, yeah...

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.330
Humph, looks like that's him.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:00.100
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Battle of Unraikyo"

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.630
Eight-Tails, I'm here to capture you.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.430
Tune in again!
