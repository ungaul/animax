WEBVTT

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.790
Don't forget about me!

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.670
We're both women, so don't mock me!

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.540
Naruto…Sasuke…Sakura!

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.080
You guys make a nice picture right now.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.670
I really love you guys!

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.420
Now!

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.080
Cha!

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.540
All right!

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.170
Six Paths Planetary Devastation!

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.080
To think that I, the originator of chakra…

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.000
would be defeated by pieces of my own chakra, again…

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.960
Why?!

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.080
Hmm? They've done it!

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.380
All that's left is to bring you all back!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.460
Is the ground being sucked up towards her?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.750
We finally made it out!

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.210
Kurama, your Jinchuriki's pretty good.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.330
CONGRATULATIONS

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.620
Over here!

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.960
Sasuke!

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.870
What happened to Naruto?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.830
He went off by himself,

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.080
saying there was something he had to take care of.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.460
More importantly, we need to get farther away from here!

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.830
At this point, it can't be helped.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.870
I'll just start over and work on Mother's next resurrection!

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.080
That reminds me,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.870
you don't like being separated from your mom, right?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.410
D-Damn you!

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.660
I haven't forgotten about you.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.580
Hiding in the shadows and creeping around for all this time!

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.160
You!

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.710
You're just a piece of the shinobi history I created.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.960
A brat like you could never…!

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.410
History?

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.540
Shinobi history…

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.910
consists of all sorts of ninja's lives, and deaths!

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.870
Many shinobi taught me what it means to be a shinobi.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.000
The pain and sadness of death… the tragedy of war.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.870
And not only that!

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.660
They taught me the joy of being accepted and being loved!

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.080
The way they lived… and the way they died…

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.410
made me who I am!

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.750
They taught me and trusted me!

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.160
You're a brat who can't even leave the nest!

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.080
Get over yourself!

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.790
It's still growing.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.000
It's like a moon.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.870
Guys!

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.330
It's over.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.660
The seal is complete!

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.460
We can finally celebrate!

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.040
You're right.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.160
The first thing I want is a hot bath

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.870
to wash away all this sweat and grime.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.330
Hold on a sec! What about us?!

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.830
How are we supposed to get out of this Time-Space?!

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.750
Oh no! You're right! This is bad! This is bad!

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.750
He does whatever needs to get done.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.460
But he's still pretty dumb, isn't he?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Summoning Jutsu!

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.080
Welcome home, Naruto.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.910
Dad…

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.960
Naruto, who's this?

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.000
Six Paths Super Gramps!

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.580
Which means…

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.910
That's right, you're back in your world

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.160
through a Summoning performed by all prior Five Kage together.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I called all of the previous Five Kage

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.620
from the afterworld to help.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.460
Naruto, Sasuke… and the rest of you…

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.910
Excellent work saving the world.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.160
Six Paths Super Gramps?

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.160
Are you by any chance the legendary…?

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.210
I am Hagoromo Otsutsuki.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.040
Also known as the Sage of the Six Paths.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.540
No wonder…you're levitating.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.290
At this point, nothing shocks me anymore.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.410
It seems like everything went well.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.330
The Shinobi World sure went to hell while we were dead.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.000
Damn it!

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.160
It's the first time I've seen so many Tailed Beasts together in one place!

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.410
The Sage of the Six Paths, eh…

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.000
It feels like we've wandered into a fairy tale!

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.250
So you are the one, after all.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.960
Summoning the past Five Kage here and...

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.000
being able to bring the Tailed Beasts and us back from the other Time-Space…

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:33.370
You're probably the only person who could perform such godly actions.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.830
Are you Kakashi Hatake?

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.870
Oh…yes.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.660
Good job guiding everyone and sealing my mother away.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.750
That truly was the work of gods.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:46.910
Oh, no.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.460
I hardly played any part at all.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.290
It was these three and many comrades.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.160
And…a former friend also lent me strength.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:07.370
That's why I said you guided everyone well.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.790
Despite losing your way,

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.710
you remained Naruto's teacher and Obito's friend.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.460
Or else, you likely wouldn't have succeeded in stopping my mother.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.910
Hey! Kurama!

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.160
Were you lonely being separated from me?

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.910
I missed you!

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.960
Don't talk so loud!

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.620
I wasn't lonely.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.160
You have half of me inside you…remember?

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.160
Just look at Kurama, all embarrassed and flustered!

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.290
But this is exactly what I had once envisioned.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.710
That there would one day be a shinobi,

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.960
who could move even the Tailed Beasts to cooperate.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.620
Even Obito was Naruto's doing…

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.250
He restored Obito.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.910
I see…

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.910
Then I shall ask Obito to tell me that tale in the afterworld.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.790
Is he still…?

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.210
I‘m gonna get going soon.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.540
Yeah…

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.830
I really made a mess out of the Shinobi World.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.250
So much that I don't even know what to say to you before I go.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.040
We're able to say goodbye as friends, not enemies.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.160
To the old you…

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.160
the one who was always late because you were helping others.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.870
That's plenty enough for me.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.040
Thanks, Kakashi.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.910
I'll be going then.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.870
I've been keeping Rin waiting.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.910
Do you have an excuse ready?

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.120
I told her beforehand I'd be helping you.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.660
I see…

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.790
Same here…

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.290
Thank you, Obito.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.410
Kakashi Sensei!

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.120
Sakura… Thank you.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.120
Kakashi Sensei, your eyes!

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.750
Yeah…

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.080
As of today, Kakashi of the Sharingan is no more.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.410
Madara was a Jinchuriki. Even if it was temporary…

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.370
emptied of the Tailed Beast, he won't last long.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.120
It's his fault for trying to use such things.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:48.710
Sasuke, Naruto… Behold, the end of your predecessors.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.620
You should watch this closely.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.790
Is that you, Hashirama?

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:16.040
I guess neither you, nor I could achieve what we wanted.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.750
It's never that easy!

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.210
Our job is to do all that we can, while we're alive.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.500
And then, bequeath the rest for future generations to accomplish.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.660
So naïve…

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.660
as usual.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:44.460
You…were always…the optimist.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:53.370
But perhaps… that is the correct path.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.250
My dream…

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.870
was squashed.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.250
But your dream…

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.830
still lives on.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.040
We were both too hasty.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.500
We didn't need to fulfill our dreams ourselves.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.580
It was more important to cultivate those who would come after us…

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.370
to whom we could entrust our dreams.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.830
Which means I would have failed anyway.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.870
Since I always hated someone… standing behind me…

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:42.870
When we were kids… You once said we're shinobi

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.330
and we don't know when we'll die.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.830
And that for neither side to die,

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.830
we'd both have to reveal what's inside of us

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.330
and pour each other drinks to toast like brothers.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.000
But we're both about to die.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:05.580
Right now, we can drink together, as war buddies.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.620
War buddies…huh?

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.910
Well…

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.870
I guess…that's okay…

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.830
by…

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.660
This is the perfect moment.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.540
I will release the jutsu, free the Five Kages

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.660
and those under the Reanimation.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.790
Go.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.580
Dad…

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.160
Oh, that's right.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.330
I've been meaning to tell you…

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.870
Happy birthday!

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.830
You've become a splendid young man, Naruto

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.120
Yeah… Thank you.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.830
We're an existence outside of the rules.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.330
We can't remain in this world forever.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.460
It's time to say good-bye.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.870
I promise to tell Kushina everything.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.710
Tell her not to worry. I'm eating properly!

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.790
I'm not picky and eat lots of different stuff!

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.910
Like, tonkotsu ramen, miso ramen, and shoyu ramen…

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.870
Oh but, not just ramen though!

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.620
I try to bathe every day!

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.460
I go to the Leaf Hot Springs once in a while too!

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.460
Although everyone just says I only take quick dips…

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.830
What else, what else… I've made lots of friends!

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.830
And they're all good guys!

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And…

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.870
I was really awful at school, but I never got depressed and

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.000
had more confidence than anyone else!

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.290
Naturally, I always obeyed

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.080
Lord Third and Kakashi Sensei.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.790
I respect them both!

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.080
They're right here, so you can ask them yourself!

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.580
Oh! And those Three Prohibitions of Shinobi?

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.080
I learned a lot about that when I was with Pervy Sage!

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.790
He was hopeless when it came to them though…

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.250
but he was an awesome Sannin

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.290
and I respect him the most!

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.660
I just turned 17 today,

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.580
so I don't know much about alcohol or girls…

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.410
I know Mom said to find someone like her…

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.410
But…that's…um…

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.910
Anyways!

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.460
Not everything Mom told me about went well,

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.290
but I'm doing the best I can!

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.210
I've got dreams too!

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.620
I'm gonna become an even greater Hokage than you, Dad!

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.080
I swear I will!

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.290
So when you see Mom over there, please tell her…

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.910
that she doesn't have to worry about me at all!

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.790
Tell her I'm doin' my best!

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:38.790
Got it…

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.910
I'll make sure to tell her everything.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.160
Having fought my mother Kaguya…

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.370
Is there any change to the answers you gave me?

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.250
My answer's the same.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.910
Now then, Sasuke… What about you?

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.870
Yes, but first…

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.000
the current Five Kage inside the Infinite Tsukuyomi…

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.370
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Final Valley"

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.870
What did you just say, Sasuke?!

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:18.750
THE FINAL VALLEY Tune in again!
