WEBVTT

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.030
What is...that...?

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.630
That's...what Master Jiraiya was talking about...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.700
The Nine-Tail's Cloak...huh...?

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.570
So that's the Jinchuriki's...

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.170
No wonder... his punches were so hard...

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.230
It's so hot...!

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.400
Listen carefully, Kakashi.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.400
At some point...

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.870
the Nine-Tail's Chakra may leak out of Naruto's body...

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.370
and take the form of the Fox Spirit.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.330
The Chakra will turn into the Fox Spirit?!

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.430
You can refer to it as the Nine-Tail's Cloak.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.600
The Nine-Tail's Cloak...?

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.370
If the Nine-Tail's Cloak appears, you must be careful!

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.300
Listen carefully...

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.200
You must stop it while there's still only one tail...

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.200
If you don't...

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.900
you'll end up seeing something frightening...

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.630
Aesthetics of an Instant 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.500
Right from the start...

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.230
Calm down, Naruto!

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.070
He's lost his ability to think calmly and rationally.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.930
It's dangerous to approach him carelessly...

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.800
If the need arises...use this.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.200
With this, you can immediately suppress the Chakra.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.530
I'm saved...

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.970
Have you calmed down, Naruto?

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.000
What in the world did Master Jiraiya see?

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.330
I got to see something pretty cool.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.670
Someone's...coming...

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.300
We finally meet up.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.500
S-Sakura...

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.570
You did well to find us here.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.970
We felt a huge tremor earlier...

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.970
You guys...did it, huh?

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.400
Yeah...

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.770
It looks like you're still... having some trouble here...

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.570
Unfortunately...

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.930
What happened with Gaara...?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.100
All right...

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.030
Don't tell me...

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.030
I can't believe my man Sasori

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.130
got beaten by a little girl and that old hag...

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.330
Eternal beauty that remains long into the future, my butt.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.000
He goes and dies just like that...

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.400
He was too confident in that form with its weakness in full view!

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.000
Well, from my standpoint,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.130
it was an ending befitting of an artist.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.830
Good work, Neji.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.400
Good work, Neji!

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.730
I haven't worked at all.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.030
I see...

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.270
That must be the Byakugan that's passed down through the Leaf...

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.130
along with the Sharingan.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.230
You used those eyes to approach me from my blind spot, huh...?

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.300
It's the first time I've seen the real deal...

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.170
I'd like to see how it's different from Itachi's Sharingan.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.100
But I think escaping from this situation comes first now.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.000
Heh! Now that Team Guy, the strongest in all the Leaf is here...

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.130
you can't escape!

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.600
Exactly!

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.670
Prepare yourself!

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.870
Team Guy, huh?

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.370
Not bad.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.400
Severe Leaf Hurricane!

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.730
Looks like it's impossible to get away by foot...

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.970
Here I go!

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.370
8 Trigrams!

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.370
Air Palm!

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.830
These guys are sure pesky...!

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.230
I'm sure it's around here...

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.100
Down there, huh?!

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.570
He went down!

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.000
We don't know what he's planning.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.630
Don't lower your guard!

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.900
- Roger! - Roger!

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.570
Be careful, everyone!

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.970
He's a long-range type who uses explosives!

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.830
I'll show you my ultimate work of art...

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.430
He's concentrating his Chakra in one spot all at once!

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.300
Don't tell me...

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.530
Get back quickly, everyone!

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.930
Art is explosive!

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.870
We won't make it in time!

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:05.900
What's going on?!

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.000
I somehow made it in time...

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.470
You okay, Kakashi Sensei?

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.900
I'd expect no less from my rival...

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.570
What in the world... did you do?

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.530
I blew the explosion... into another dimension.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.770
Another dimension?!

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.030
This is...a Sharingan Vision Jutsu...

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.070
I don't really get what happened,

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.730
but the enemy has been defeated, right, Tenten?

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.870
Hey! Don't ask me that.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.730
More importantly... Is everyone okay?

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.700
Sakura...

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.670
Sakura...

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:56.700
Why...? Why did... Why is it always Gaara?

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.570
Did he have to die like this...?!

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.530
He's the Kazekage...

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.500
He just became the Kazekage...

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:14.470
Calm down, Naruto Uzumaki...

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.230
Shut up!

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.530
This wouldn't have happened

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:31.600
if you Sand Shinobi hadn't put a monster inside Gaara!

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:38.230
Did you even ask Gaara at all about how he felt?!

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.530
Jinchuriki, my butt!

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.830
You've no right to act so self-important by labeling us...

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.630
with that word you  created!

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.770
Naruto...

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.530
I can't save Sasuke...

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.800
And I can't save...Gaara...

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.770
I trained so hard for three years.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.570
Nothing's changed since three years ago...

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.870
Granny Chiyo... That Jutsu will...!

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.600
Granny Chiyo...

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:43.400
Everything I've done until now was wrong.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.530
However, it looks like I'll finally be able to do something right at the end.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:55.830
The world of the Sand and the Leaf created by foolish old people is finished.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.100
I'm sure the future you build from here on out

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.670
will be much different than ours.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.770
