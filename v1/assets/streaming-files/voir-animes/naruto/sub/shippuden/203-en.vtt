WEBVTT

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.690
By the way, I ate you… What are you gonna do?!

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.610
Oh yeah, what'll I do?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.820
There is a way to stop me.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.480
Undo these chains and I'll tell you.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.730
Son!

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.860
You have to tell me how to stop you.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.360
First, just one thing…

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.650
I don't trust Jinchuriki on principle.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.730
Especially fools like you

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.440
who claim they want to be friends with Tailed Beasts.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.400
In other words…

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.900
Don't think that if you set me free,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.650
I'll be your ally.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.110
That's a response to be expected…

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.070
Nine Tails…

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.280
This transient form is nothing more than a nodule.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.440
You're only a piece of yourself.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.280
Shut up…

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.480
You are just an ignorant unstable power…

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.650
Shut up!

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.400
Those who shall guide you are the Uchiha.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.070
You Tailed Beasts are simply servants of those with Visual Prowess.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.530
Shut the hell up!

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.780
Obey!

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.980
Nine Tails…

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.530
Your power is too great.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.440
Regrettably, I cannot let you run loose.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.360
When you exert your power, you draw hatred to you.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480
Please stay quiet inside me.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.110
This is unfortunate for both of us…

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.860
You may be here to keep the world in check,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.860
but I'm here to watch you.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.610
Even though you have no strength

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.610
you force your ideals on me to restrain me.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.650
Okay, now for the Eight Trigram Seal…

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.980
I'm going to seal Nine Tails in Naruto.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.440
Does he intend to seal me again?

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.570
Into that brat?

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.690
Kushina! Are you okay?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.320
Stop it!

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.360
Eight Trigram Seal…

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.530
The same thing happened sixteen years ago…

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.840
Nine Tails

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.510
Where am I?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.840
Seems like I'm inside that kid… What's this?

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.470
An Eight Trigram Seal? I see.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.050
The Fourth Hokage plans on letting this brat use my power…

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.800
Even if half of my existence has been sealed away,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.550
he underestimates me.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.680
Me…! The very one those Jinchuriki had to go so far to restrain.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.880
This seal is nothing.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.300
Even so, this will take a while to break.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.130
But if I keep sending chakra through the cracks,

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.800
it'll eventually weaken…

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.430
Fine, this is no fun, but I need to do it to get out.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.380
I'll give this brat power.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.840
You did terrible in today's taijutsu class.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.090
Don't come to school, loser. I hate looking at you.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.300
You'll never become a ninja in a hundred years.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.880
Shut up! I'll make you pay for that.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.090
Come and get me!

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.720
You'll regret saying that!

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.680
Ouch…

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.220
Damn it! How long is he going to make me wait?

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.090
If you don't use your power, my seal won't weaken.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.590
I'll show you one day!

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.510
He's…

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.510
Naruto Uzumaki from the Village Hidden in the Leaves…

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.090
Iruka…

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.300
I said I'd get to you later, but I changed my mind.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.720
Hurry up and die!

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.340
Don't lay your hands on Iruka Sensei!

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.510
I'll kill you!

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.300
Y-You idiot! Why did you come out?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.720
Run away!

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.380
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.930
Finally…

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.340
My chakra is gathering and taking the form of a fox…

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.050
Damn it! Take this!

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.430
For now, the key to getting him to use my power

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.050
is when his life is in danger or when he's emotionally at the brink.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.300
But using me unconsciously still isn't enough.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.680
I need him to be conscious of my existence…

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.590
and use my power regularly…

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.720
Thank you for asking me!

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.470
I'm known as… the immortal Toad Sage of Mount Myoboku…

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.470
Call me the Toad Sage!

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.880
S-Sage?

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.720
So this is the man who was the Fourth Hokage's master…

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.680
He's probably going to pass on his ideas to the kid

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.760
and try to control me…

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.760
Well, for now, this is a good opportunity for me.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.220
What is it?!

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.430
This is the end of your training.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.380
If you don't want to die, then handle things on your own.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.760
What?

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.680
The kid's finally come to me.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.300
I want to eat and kill you, but this gate won't open…

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.130
This bloody seal…

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.800
You… You're…

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.970
the Nine Tails!

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.880
For you to approach me… What business brought you here?

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.220
Hey! You stupid fox!

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:05.470
Since you're staying in my body, give me your chakra as rent!

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.430
That's fine… As a reward for making it this far…

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.970
I'll give it to you!

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.380
Summoning Jutsu!

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.510
I did it! I successfully did…

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.220
– What a fool. – the Summoning Jutsu!

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.010
He acts as if my power is his own…

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:46.300
But now, he can clearly sense my presence

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.680
and will use my power even more now…

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.630
Something with claws and fangs…

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.510
I won't let you go.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.300
Sasuke, I'll…

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.510
That's right…

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.260
Keep using my power!

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.680
The more you rely on my power and draw chakra from me…

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.260
the weaker this seal gets.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.130
We've just gotten word that the Hidden Sand's Kazekage

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.180
has been abducted by an organization known as Akatsuki.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.680
I will now…

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.340
give my new orders to Team Kakashi.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.970
If I'm not mistaken,

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.930
this kid knows the One Tail's Jinchuriki.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:44.130
This kid has become quite powerful during his three years of training.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.880
But that also means that

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:51.220
I'll be able to influence things more than before.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.260
Now then…

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.380
I'll pummel him.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.800
So that's what Master Jiraiya was talking about…

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.220
If this is all it takes to make him go on a rampage…

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.340
that means the seal has become pretty weak.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.220
Just a little longer…

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.430
If I can draw out even greater hatred from this kid…

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.630
I can send in my power and destroy the seal.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.880
Just a little while longer…

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.010
SEAL

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.590
Don't talk about Sasuke, in front of me,

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.550
like you own him!

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.380
He's directing so much hatred at him.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.430
Kid, do you hate him? Do you want him to disappear?

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.800
In that case, come here and I'll give you power.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.510
Chidori Stream!

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.470
This is your chance, Naruto…

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.590
Show him our power.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.720
So…

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.970
Who do you want to kill?

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.760
Don't come out anymore. I don't need your power!

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.430
You refuse now, but who was it

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.680
that came crawling to me every time to use it?

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.010
You should know by now…

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.760
You know that you can't do anything on your own.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.510
How will you face powerful foes without my power?

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.680
This world shall know pain…

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.880
Hinata!

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.430
Undo the seal.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.130
If you do, I'll give you all of my power.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.380
Destroy everything.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.470
Erase everything that hurts.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.470
Give me your soul.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.260
I will save you from your suffering.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.340
Come this way…

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.930
Come… And rip this seal off!

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.590
FOURTH HOKAGE

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.970
You're…!

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.010
I'll rebuild the seal…

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.340
However, this is the last time.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.550
I never expected to be sealed back again by a ghost.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.430
But I still have a chance.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.550
To think, he'd just come right in with the key.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.260
Now, if I just take control of that kid's mind,

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.760
I can break free anytime I want.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.340
What did you say?

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.970
Where did the real you go? I can't sense you!

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.470
I'm right here… right in front of you!

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:05.720
SEAL

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:25.760
I see… You plan on controlling my power.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.340
You teamed up with Eight Tails!

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.510
How pathetic of the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki!

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.090
Sage Art: Super Giant Rasengan!

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:45.970
So fast!

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.470
Do you think you can beat me?

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.720
Why would I break the seal otherwise?

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.300
Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.010
You can't control my power!

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.630
You are just a small portion of my hatred!

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.180
This chakra…

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.340
Kushina, is that you?

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.590
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.760
Rasengan Super Barrage!

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.340
Don't underestimate me!

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.050
Sage Art!

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.130
Massive Rasengan…Barrage!

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.800
One more round!

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.510
What kind of power is this?

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.590
Go!

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.800
You've angered me! Naruto!

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.630
This is the Six Paths…?!

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:21.010
You watch out…Naruto.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.510
Damn it! How could this happen to me again?!

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.800
He took quite a lot of power from me…

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.880
Even though… Even though he's just…

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.380
Just what is he?

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.010
We won't trust you.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:44.510
Naruto, I've watched you all these years.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.430
You should already know.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.760
It doesn't matter what you tell me… or us Tailed Beasts.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.180
