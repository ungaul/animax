WEBVTT

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.030
Prepare yourself!

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.900
Why you--!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.630
What do you mean by suddenly pouncing on Kakashi Sensei like that?!

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.230
You wrinkly old hag!

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.700
This old hag...is good...

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.970
I'll never forget what you did back then!

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.430
White Fang of the Leaf,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.530
I shall avenge my son's death by defeating you today!

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.170
Er...no, you see... I'm... No questions or answers!

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.230
Big Sister... Take a good look at him!

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.430
He resembles him closely, but this one is not the White Fang!

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.670
Huh?

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.430
Uh...hello...

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.100
Moreover, the White Fang of the Leaf died long ago.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.070
Remember?

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.300
When you got word of it, you cried tears of regret,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.400
since you could not avenge your son.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.500
Isn't that so, Sis?

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.130
Gotcha, I was only pretending to have gone senile.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.370
Kankuro!

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.700
Let me have a look.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.300
Please do.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.300
Kakashi Sensei and the rest of you, please stand back a bit.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.870
Got it.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.630
H-Hey! You're...?

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.130
I'm a Leaf Medical Ninja.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.400
The Medical Ninja's Student 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.230
They seem to have used a heavy metal-based toxin.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.370
It's the type that acts upon the muscles to destroy the cells.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.270
Just from that brief examination...

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.600
You could tell that much...

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.330
His medical record please.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.070
Ah, here it is.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.730
This is the list of toxic ingredients.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.030
There are blank spaces here and there, but...

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.470
I can predict the general outcome.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.270
The cardiac muscle will be destroyed,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.900
and the heart could stop beating at any time, so...

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.970
It's difficult to say whether we can concoct an antidote in time...

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.070
You don't mean that! Isn't there anything we can do?

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.670
Please assemble the items I request immediately.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.900
Roger!

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.730
It's quite a crude treatment, but it's the only option we have left.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.730
Hold him down firmly,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.170
as this will be a very delicate operation.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.130
- Right. - Understood.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.870
Here...goes...

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.630
Hold him down firmly!

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.200
- Yes! - Yes!

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.930
I'll cause the Chakra to flow into his body...

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.430
It will cause the toxin to surface from the cells.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.030
It will then be absorbed by this liquid...

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.930
and extracted!

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.600
So that's the toxin...

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.970
Yes!

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.200
Next!

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.270
- Yes! - Yes!

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.830
Say... Kakashi Sensei... Huh?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.130
What sort of person was that White Fang of the Leaf

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.800
that this old lady here was talking about?

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.330
Well, that's hard to say...

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.100
Hmm, let's see...

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.400
Well, in a word...

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.400
He was my father.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.430
Hey, you there...

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.070
Are you the son of the White Fang?

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.170
Yes...

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.330
But of course...

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.770
So that's why you look so much like him...

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.630
- Next! - Yes!

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.730
I directly extracted the toxin.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.870
With this, his life should no longer be in danger.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.330
Way to go, Sakura!

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.470
But we still can't rest easy.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.530
I will now concoct an antidote for the traces of toxin

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.800
that remain in his body.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.230
Got it.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.070
If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.930
Well then, first, I need a list of the medicinal herbs

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.630
that can be found in this village, or something like that...

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.130
I'll bring it.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.100
Please replace all of his bandages.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.970
Yes.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.600
And then prepare an IV drip.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.500
Yes.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.630
Also, please set aside a small amount of the extracted toxin.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.400
I will need it later.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.430
Sakura... You're so cool.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.400
You're just like the Slug Girl.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.570
To think that a girl just like you would come here...

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.300
Yes, Lady Tsunade is my master.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.670
And besides, I was told by my master to come here.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.730
Here is the list of medicinal herbs.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.300
Thank you.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:34.500
Say Sis... Time is flowing slowly, but it's flowing.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.970
Hey! Takamaru has returned!

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.530
Master Baki, a reply has come from Leaf Village.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.170
Thank you for your troubles.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.000
It's from the Hokage.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.930
What's Granny Tsunade saying?!

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.170
It says that Guy's squad has been sent here as a reinforcement unit.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.070
Bushy Brow Sensei's squad...?

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.600
I'll bet everyone has gotten stronger.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.470
They even said that Neji has become a Jonin.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.470
All right!

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.030
Now's no time for us to just be hanging around!

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.530
We should go after the Akatsuki... right now!

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.030
Going after him is fine and well...

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.600
But do you know where those guys have gone to?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.570
Um, excuse me for inquiring,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.600
but what is the follow-up to the Akatsuki pursuit?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.100
First, Kankuro set off by himself and ended up like that.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.700
Next, a tracking unit was sent out, but they've yet to contact us.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.730
Judging from the situation, it's likely that...

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.330
One of the other village chiefs has gone missing.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.800
I don't like to think that he could be taken out so easily, but...

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.500
Then, you mean to say you've completely lost sight of him?

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.030
Yes, that is so.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.930
Lord Baki!

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.970
Kankuro has awoken!

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.630
Kankuro, are you all right?!

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.130
What, you're back already, Temari...?

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.470
I heard the village was in crisis.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.900
Sorry...for making you worry.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.430
You fool, don't talk such nonsense!

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.700
Please lead me to the place where Kankuro did battle.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.170
I may not look it, but I'm a pro at tracking...

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.730
If just the slightest trace of their scent remains...

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.230
There's no need of that.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.800
My puppets...have all been recovered, haven't they?

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.800
I never imagined I'd find this assortment

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.100
of medicinal herbs here in the Hidden Sand.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.300
Still, the soil is not well suited to growing medicinal herbs...

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.000
In particular, we only have a small amount of "Scurvy Grass."

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.570
No, this much is plenty.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.230
I can make at least three antidotes.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.100
The enemy force was two in number.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.100
One of them led Gaara away...

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.070
All you have to do it follow Gaara's scent.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.600
Even if they split up into two, one of them...

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.330
His smell is on that one...

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.400
In Crow's hand...

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.970
I left him holding a scrap of his clothes...

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.400
Even if you fall, you won't fall without a fight...

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.270
Just what I'd expect from a Sand Ninja.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.370
Kankuro! Are you all right?

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.930
Y-Yeah...

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.600
Ah, he came all the way from Hidden Leaf Village for us.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.970
Naruto...Uzumaki...is it?

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.530
Hey...

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:00.930
I see...

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.330
Summoning Jutsu!

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.330
Eight Ninja Dogs, at your service!

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.030
Pakkun!

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.400
Hey! Is that you, Naruto?! Long time no see.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.130
Pakkun, you haven't changed a bit, have you?

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.500
You haven't either.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:24.630
Eh?! I've grown quite a bit taller.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.930
Yes, yes, but enough of this chatter.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.000
I need you to get to work right away!

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.070
I want you to determine which way he headed.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.370
Now, go!

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.070
We'll contact you right away when we find something.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.530
We're counting on you.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:51.970
All right!

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:55.100
When Pakkun and the others get back,

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.330
we're heading out, I tell you!

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.500
We've got to make preparations right away...

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.400
Naruto, wait a minute!

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.700
Kankuro...!

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.970
Granny Chiyo? Grandpa Ebizo, too?!

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.930
I want to hear it one more time, directly from your mouth...

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.930
There is no mistake that one of the two enemies was Sasori.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.770
Is that correct?

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.870
What about it, Kankuro?

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.730
Yeah... It was Sasori of the Red Sand.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.730
He said so himself.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.970
Sasori of the Red Sand, you say?

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.200
We might be able to find out more about Akatsuki.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.900
Please...

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.030
It's ready...

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.700
Be sure to drink it all down...

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.830
You should be all right now, I think.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.800
Just lie there and rest for a while without moving

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.330
until the numbness goes away.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.830
You should all get a good night's rest as well.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.500
I've prepared a room for you to use.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.000
But we've got to find Gaara quickly...

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.070
I'll take advantage of your kindness, if I may.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.300
We're going on a harsh march from tomorrow.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.170
I understand...

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.270
I just have to work hard and carve out a future for myself.

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.670
And I must not run away from my path of solitude.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.730
If I do that, someday...

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.470
Someday...I can be like him...

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.200
Don't order me around!

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.670
That's enough outta you!

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.670
I have never thought of you all as my brothers.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.530
If you get in my way, I'll kill you.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:19:00.500
But now there's something I understand about the bonds

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.800
he went so far to tell me about.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.100
I understand that pain, sadness...and happiness...

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.530
can be shared with others.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.200
Naruto Uzumaki...

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:22.770
I learned that through fighting and getting to know him.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:29.200
He knew of the same pain as me.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:34.670
And he taught me that I could change the path of my life.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.970
Naruto Uzumaki...

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.370
Mm?

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.600
Take care of my little brother...

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.770
Heh, you can leave it to me.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.000
After all, I am eventually going to become the Hokage!

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.670
So I'll do the Kazekage a favor early on!

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.470
Aim to remain in active duty your entire life!

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.070
Today, the High Achievers Club

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.700
is pleased to introduce Granny Chiyo of the Hidden Sand.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.730
Well, to get right to the point, what are your hobbies?

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.670
- Fishing. - What a simple answer.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.930
Well then, what is your special forte?

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.970
- Playing dead. - Your individuality shines!

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.500
Well next, what are your concerns at this time?

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:52.330
My grandchild.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.270
Hey, are you watching? Sasori?

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.500
I'll be the one to punish you! Wash your neck and wait!

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.570
