00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.330
This is the place, huh?

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.900
Gaara is on the other side of this boulder.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.670
It looks like they put up a barrier.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600
What's the plan?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.400
Let's bust through!

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.300
No!

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.970
You're late, Kakashi.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.830
Well, you see...

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.100
we got caught up in something troublesome along the way.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.730
Naruto! Sakura!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.100
Kakashi... By troublesome, you certainly don't mean me, do you?

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.800
Hey!

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
Naruto...

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.100
Now, shall we do this, Kakashi?

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.530
Yeah.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.430
FORBIDDEN

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.930
Hang on, Gaara.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.970
Charge Tactic! Button Hook Entry!! 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.570
It looks like there's a large cavern inside, but...

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.030
But...?

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.970
I can't really see clearly what's going on inside...

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.170
It looks like there are several people inside...

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.230
What about Gaara, Neji?

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.930
What's happening to Gaara?!

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.470
Wait!

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.300
I'm searching right now!

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.900
Neji!

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.570
Hey!

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.400
Wh-What's...that...?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.730
What is it? Hey! What's in there, Neji?!

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.430
Let go of me...

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.170
What was in there?

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.200
It's hard to explain in words...

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.530
Which means...

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.230
Which means we just have to check it out directly for ourselves, right?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.070
That makes things simple.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.330
A barrier, huh...?

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.430
It's getting noisy outside.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.970
It appears they've arrived.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.300
Which group? Hm?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.500
The group my man Kisame stalled?

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.230
Or is it...

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.100
It's...both groups...

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.770
So they arrived at the same time, huh?

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.770
However...

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.470
They were just a bit late...

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.400
It seems they've got another Jinchuriki with them...

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.670
Don't take it personally, Itachi.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.630
What's the plan?

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.730
First, we have to remove the barrier, Lee.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.430
How do we do that?

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.400
We need to figure out what kind of barrier it is, right?

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.800
Yeah.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.800
All right. First, we need to find out what type of barrier this is!

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.000
Isn't that right, Kakashi!

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.900
Right.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.900
FORBIDDEN

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.830
What does it look like to you?

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.170
This is...a Five-Seal Barrier.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.500
I agree.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.700
A Five-Seal Barrier?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.730
A Five-Seal Barrier is created by placing...

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.900
paper tags with "Forbidden" written on them in five locations in the area.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.230
There's the Forbidden tag here in front of us...

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.570
and tags in four other locations...

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.400
How can we remove them?

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.400
We can't remove the barrier

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.670
unless we remove the tags in all five locations simultaneously.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.200
It must be done simultaneously, huh?

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.730
That's right.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.500
The barrier can't be removed unless the five tags are removed simultaneously.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.500
That's how it's been set up.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:06.700
That tag there...

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.770
And there are four others...

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.500
FORBIDDEN

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.800
Then, where are the other four tags?!

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.600
Neji.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.500
I know.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.230
Byakugan!

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.730
I found them!

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.030
Where are they, Neji?!

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.030
There's one on a boulder about 500 meters northeast of here...

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.800
The...second one...

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.200
is on the trunk of a tree growing along a riverbank

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.330
350 meters to the south-southeast...

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.800
The third one...

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.430
is on a cliff about 650 meters to the northwest...

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.000
The last one...

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.830
is in a forest a little less than 800 meters to the southwest...

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.870
Those are the four locations.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.400
If so, then they are pretty far away.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.800
What will the signal be?

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.600
No problem there!

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.630
At that distance...

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.000
we should be able to use wireless radios.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.770
Wireless radios, huh?!

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.170
I see.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.700
Okay, we'll all stay in communication and find the tags with Neji's directions!

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.170
Now then. Shall we get going...?

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.730
It's starting to get noisy outside

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.800
and we've got our mission to complete, after all.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.770
Exactly...

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.900
What shall we do with the guys outside?

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.900
Well, we don't even know if they can get in here...

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.430
Don't underestimate them.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.400
You should know.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:21.500
Well... I acknowledge their brute strength, at least.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.670
Sasori.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.570
Deidara.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.430
You take care of the guys outside.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.300
I knew it would turn out like this...

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.900
But take the Jinchuriki alive.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.800
We know.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.430
Everyone else is dismissed.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.430
Let's go.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.170
Right...

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.100
We'll be leaving, too...

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.200
Itachi...

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
What's the Nine-Tailed Jinchuriki like?

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.100
Tell him.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.600
He'll be the first one to yell and scream at you.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.630
What does that mean?

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.870
Doesn't he have any more specific characteristics?

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.230
Oh my...

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.370
Well, that's about it...

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.770
You okay with that? Wasn't he your target?

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.330
Let's go.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:13.800
Okay.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.600
We'll remove the tags in the four surrounding locations.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.970
If this is a competition of speed, our team will probably be faster, after all.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.270
We're counting on you!

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.000
All right, you head for the northwest forest, Lee!

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.930
Yes, Guy Sensei!

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.170
I leave the northeast boulder to you, Neji.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.330
Roger.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.270
And you take the south-southeast, Tenten.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.670
Understood.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.400
I'll head for the northwest cliff.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.830
I'm sure that one will be in the location most difficult to remove.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.970
What's the frequency?

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.530
174.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.300
Roger.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.270
Can you hear me guys?

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.870
Lee! You've got your microphone turned up too high!

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.700
Oh!

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.070
I'm sorry!

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.330
Lee... Lee...!

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.070
I'm sorry...

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.070
My wireless radio settings are okay.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.400
Mine are okay as well.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.530
All right. Team Guy...

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.770
R-Right!

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.570
Okay, okay...

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.200
With the full power of youth!

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.670
- Fight! -Yeah!

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.170
- Fight! - Yeah!

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.900
- Fight! Fight! - Yeah! Yeah!

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.470
- And an extra fight! - Yeah!

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.030
Scatter!

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.270
How cool. What cool enthusiasm!

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.000
Hey guys, let's do that, too...!

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.400
I'd rather die...

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:14.800
Right...

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.130
You fool...!

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.070
Well, it's time for me to get going.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.130
There's no reason for me to be here if I'll just be in the way.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.230
Good work, Pakkun.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.930
Okay, I'm gone...

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.070
I leave the rest to you.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.830
Right...

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.870
We got it...

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.830
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.130
Verifying operation.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.470
The four members of Team Guy are to stand by once they find their tags!

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.170
After all members have reached their positions...

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.100
we'll remove the tags all at once on my signal!

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.330
Got it?!
Yes!

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.730
Of course, Team Kakashi will remove their tags simultaneously as well.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.030
With this, the Five-Seal Barrier will be removed.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.570
The moment the barrier is removed...

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.630
Sakura will destroy the boulder at the entrance.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:47.030
That will be our signal to break inside... and recover Gaara.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.630
Gaara...

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.670
They're late...

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.270
I wish they'd just hurry up and get here...

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.930
What's wrong, my man Sasori?

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.600
I thought you didn't like to be kept waiting.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.130
Yeah... I hate it...

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.630
Sasori...

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:37.770
I never thought... a day like this would come...

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.370
This is Neji. I'm in position.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.070
I've found mine, too! I'll be arriving soon.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.170
I've got mine, too!

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.370
Neji!

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.230
I know!

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:00.630
Byakugan!

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.230
A little further south!

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.630
A little further... All right, it's right there!

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.270
Okay! I found it!

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.130
This is Lee! I'm in position!

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.500
Kakashi, how's it going there?

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.500
We're ready when you are.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.200
We'll break in using the Button Hook Entry.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.430
Right.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.200
I know!

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:37.700
Yeah!

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:47.070
All right, everyone! Remove the tags on the count of three!

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:48.600
Here we go!

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.270
One...two...three!

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.430
Sakura!

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.400
Right!

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.900
All right, it looks like it went well...

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.970
Wh-What's that...?!

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.400
We're too late...

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.400
Sasori...

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:37.830
Now...which one's the Jinchuriki?

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.500
You...creeps.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.500
I'll kill the both of you!

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.600
The first one to start yelling and screaming...

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.830
It's him, huh?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.530
It looks like it.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.930
Now then, I'm going to take out a scroll you can find anywhere.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.200
But when I count to three, a huge Shuriken appears...

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.270
Hey, don't be taking someone else's skills!

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.870
Shut up! I'm practicing for a talent show.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.600
What did you say?!

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:53.670
Hey, stop the stupid fighting. I'll teach you my best skill.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.600
Look at these wonderful midair Kunai Knives!

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.400
Oh, the Kunai Knives are floating!

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.700
I'll teach you for just 300 ryo.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.430
Uh... I can't do it without the Puppet Master technique anyway.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.800
