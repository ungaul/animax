WEBVTT

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.360
The Nine Tails' Chakra Mode.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.530
Great for lighting the night road,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.570
could cost me my life like a double-edged knife.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.690
Naruto may have learned to use Nine Tails' Chakra Mode,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.230
but he hasn't made the Nine Tails his friend.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.110
Nine Tails continues to sap Naruto's chakra.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.440
When Naruto's chakra reaches zero, he'll die.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.230
Oh yeah. But Naruto's tension's high. Be a shame to stop that passion…

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.860
It's okay to use Nine Tails' chakra like a flashlight.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.610
But stick close to him, Bee!

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.980
You got it.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.480
Naruto…

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.070
You're always so careless with my chakra.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.530
I've been inside you, watching you for a long time.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.610
Naruto…

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.480
You are still so naïve.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.400
I will settle this war by myself!

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.940
I will bear all of the hatred and the pain!

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.360
That is my duty!

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.440
Thanks to my chakra, looks like you've put on some weight.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.610
But it's not like you, Nine Tails… to start up a conversation.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.530
I know you're starting to get lonely and want to talk,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.480
but I'm busy now!

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.730
Let's do this later!

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.280
Do you seriously think you can end this war by yourself?

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.150
It's impossible.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.070
I'm sure you've sensed how huge the enemy is.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.480
This is Madara we're talking about. There's no telling what he'll do.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.400
You're welcome to use my power…

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.360
I'm not falling for that anymore!

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.400
You've gotten a bit smarter, I see.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.570
That was so obvious!

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.070
We'll talk after the war.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.440
See ya!

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.860
If your comrades are killed, hatred will rise.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.440
Are you planning to defeat the enemy before that happens?

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.480
If you defeat the enemy, they'll bear hatred towards you.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.610
Do you honestly think you can take all of that on yourself?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.940
Stop treating me…

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.440
like I'm stupid!

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.440
Unison Sign Stop treating me like I'm stupid!

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.530
You don't understand a thing! You're naïve!

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.150
Can you honestly take on and erase everyone's hatred?!

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.610
The war has already started.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.230
There must be a considerable amount of casualties already.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.400
And, the resulting hatred.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.440
First of all, Sasuke, who used to be with you,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.110
has been gripped by hatred for a long time.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.530
Have you ever been able to do anything for him?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.780
Ever since that day…

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.530
That's right, you've known it ever since that day.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.480
NINJA ACADEMY

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.690
Who am I going against?

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.650
Who's my guy?

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.860
The kid with the doggy cap?

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.900
The hooded kid with the shades?

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.820
Or…

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.610
Um…Sensei…

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.940
What is it?

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.980
I don't want to fight my friend.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.400
No, this isn't about hitting.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.940
This is just some traditional Shinobi Hand-to-Hand Combat.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.820
Even the Hokage who came before,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.610
trained and got stronger by sparring…

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.860
Umm…

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.400
Sensei, you can put me down for going out of bounds.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.610
Please move on to the next ones up.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.940
H-Hey!

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.570
You might call this training or whatever,

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.190
but if there's going to be a winner, it's got to be a match.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.900
Since that's the case, wouldn't it save you trouble

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.530
by just deciding who wins at the start?

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.110
He really has no motivation. He'll never make chunin.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.570
No, not necessarily.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.530
Huh?

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.530
Life is long. A lot could happen.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.820
Man, you're sure fixated on the minor details!

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.360
That Shikamaru, he's the most trouble of all!

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.730
And you, Choji, you've got no guts!

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.190
Ino, do you know those boys?

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.030
Yeah well, our parents… Forget it…

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.570
Shikamaru, Choji… give the Unison Sign.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.110
Oh, I forgot.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.480
I'm sorry, Shikamaru.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.940
Forget it… You were never good at stuff like this.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.570
It's a drag for me, too.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.860
Good, you've done the Unison Sign.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.610
Next, Naruto Uzumaki!

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.110
Yes!

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.030
Is he the one…?

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.400
My parents said not to speak to him.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.320
He's one guy I don't want to be paired with.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.570
And Sasuke Uchiha. Step forward.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.530
Sasuke!

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.230
I wish I could do the Unison Sign with Sasuke!

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.360
Do your best, Sasuke!

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.360
Pound your opponent!

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.360
What's with him acting so cool?!

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.400
Damn it! I'll take down Mr. Popular

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.400
and show her who she should be looking at!

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.400
I'm not gonna lose. No way!

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.530
H-Hang in there…Naru… Sasuke!

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.280
It'll be Naruto Uzumaki versus Sasuke Uchiha.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.110
Come on, you idiot!

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.440
Naruto! Make the proper Spar Sign!

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.150
It's part of the etiquette!

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.150
The heck with all that!

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.480
Hurry up and let me defeat this guy!

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.780
I'm going to become popular!

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.530
What a waste of time…

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.440
I'll make it quick, just like you want.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.650
Hold on, you two!

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.030
For crying out loud!

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.030
Shinobi Hand-to-Hand Combat is a traditional training method

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.860
passed down through the generations.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.400
It might be stuffy etiquette,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.400
but here at the Academy, we start with the basics.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.360
It matters!

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.690
You always start by showing your opponent a one-handed sign,

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.230
which represents half of the two hands used when unleashing a jutsu,

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.730
and displays your intention to fight!

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.610
This is called the Spar Sign.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.320
After the sparring is done and the victor is decided,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.780
both partners present the Spar Sign,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.360
then bring their hands together to form the Unison Sign

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.530
as a show of friendship.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.690
This is the etiquette of hand-to-hand combat.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.360
Are you listening, Naruto?!

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.980
This is the second time I've explained it!

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.280
One "yes" is sufficient, you fool!

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.530
I get it.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.190
Naru… Pound him, Sasuke!

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.190
Start!

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.860
– Amazing! – He's so cool!

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.150
Sasuke, you're terrific!

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.940
Wow…

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.900
This guy…

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.440
That look in his eyes…

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.820
It's the same look that everyone gives me.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.150
No, it's stronger than that.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.570
But…

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.030
But it's not for me.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.070
Sasuke wins!

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.610
Now, both of you make the Unison Sign.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.320
All right, next!

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.730
Wait!

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.900
So you couldn't care less about me, is that it, you turd?!

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.110
No, you piece of crap! Hard and runny!

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.480
Stupid! Stupid!

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.650
The guy's so dumb, he can't even swear properly.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.230
I wish he'd make up his mind

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.400
if he's constipated or got the runs. The reason is…

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.070
That's what I mean by you being fixated on the minor details!

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.400
You got something to say to me, you hard and runny crap-turd?!

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.230
Ouch!

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.980
Didn't I tell you that Shinobi Hand-to-Hand Combat

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.230
is a sacred tradition?!

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.780
Now hurry up and make the Unison Sign!

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.690
You too, Sasuke!

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.570
Damn it…

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.480
You want a piece of me, you loser?!

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.030
Hey! That's enough! Both of you!

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.530
Naruto's the worst!

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.070
What is up with him?

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.030
Looks like you remembered.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.980
And then, what happened to Sasuke?

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.400
Were you able to erase his hatred?

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.400
No, in fact, just the opposite…

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.610
Have you snapped out of it yet?

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.440
You have no siblings or parents.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.820
How could you understand anything about me?!

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.400
You've been on your own since the beginning!

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.440
What makes you think you know anything about me?

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.940
Naruto…

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.530
You can't change me, no matter what you say to me now.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.980
I'm going to kill each and every person in the Leaf,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.480
including you!

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.650
Sasuke, is that really the only way?

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.070
Yes.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.110
So your only choices are

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.610
to kill me and become the hero who saved the village,

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.440
or to be killed by me, and be known as just a loser!

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.690
His hatred has grown even stronger!

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.860
It happened to your closest friend!

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.980
In other words… regardless of who you're dealing with,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.030
you can neither erase their hatred nor take it on yourself!

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.360
So?

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.780
Are you finished?

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.530
What?!

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.480
Are you trying to scare me into doing nothing?

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.650
That's exactly what you want, isn't it, Nine Tails?

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:13.570
Hey…

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.860
You're the one who's naïve!

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.400
Who are you to be so confident…

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.110
when you couldn't even save Sasuke?

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.280
Once you question your own beliefs, it's over.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.730
I will help Sasuke somehow,

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.230
and I will do something about this war!

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.360
Does he intend to seal me again?

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.940
On top of which, inside a kid like that?!

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.570
Hey, you stupid fox!

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.860
I've been letting you stay inside my body,

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.730
so why don't you pay me some rent,

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.400
and lend me some of your chakra?

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:24.650
Sage Mode…

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.860
Rasengan…Super Barrage!

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.570
Just one more round!

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.860
What is this power?!

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.110
This is…the Nine Tails'…

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.780
Naruto…

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.110
You've…

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:22.610
You've made me angry, Naruto!

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.780
You still had this much power?

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.190
You really are awesome!

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.190
Is this the Six Paths'…?!

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:58.230
You'll regret this, Naruto.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.980
The little child thinks he's grown up, does he?

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.230
Ya know, Nine Tails, I…

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.280
I'm going to come after

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.860
all that hate inside you as well, some day!

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.230
You've put me through a lot of pain,

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.780
but I know that it doesn't feel good

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.480
to be at the mercy of your hatred…

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.610
Are you stupid?!

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.400
I'm the Nine Tails, you know!

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.570
Some little child can't change me!

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.530
I am hatred!

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.940
Then it's okay!

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.070
I'm no longer a little child,

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.980
and it's more challenging that way!

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.440
Later!

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.190
Nine Tails…

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.530
You might be right about me being extremely naïve.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.780
But in my heart, you've always been with me,

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.190
like a mother and father stays with their child.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.570
You know everything about how I feel

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.650
and how I've grown up.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.280
You might not have liked doing it,

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.780
but you continued to watch over me.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.190
That's why…

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.360
I want you to be there to watch over me just a little longer.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.150
Sasuke, you too…

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.480
You might never have given a rat's ass about me

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.030
from the very beginning,

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:56.150
but I've always been watching you.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:59.780
That's right,

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.980
I'll do something about both Sasuke and the war!

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:04.940
Yo!

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.440
Naruto shining bright

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.030
Looking grave on a full-moon night

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.780
Try to lighten up…Yo!

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.440
Did you fight with the Nine Tails again?

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.190
Tailed Beast mode is a tug-of-war between the Nine Tails and chakra.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.980
When the chakra runs out, it's curtains without a doubt.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.780
So don't be reckless, yo!

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.780
I know I'm being reckless.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.530
But…

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.610
I don't go back on my words.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.320
That's my ninja way.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.150
Here we go!

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.980
Wait for me, yo!

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.400
I've taken care of all your external wounds.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.940
Please rest.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.280
Are you all right? Seems our medic ninja are being killed.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.730
Neji… It's easy to get discouraged.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.690
We don't even know who we're fighting.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.530
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Medic Ninja in Danger"

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.150
Yeah, we have to be careful. MEDIC NINJA IN DANGER

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.900
MEDIC NINJA IN DANGER

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.980
Tune in again!
