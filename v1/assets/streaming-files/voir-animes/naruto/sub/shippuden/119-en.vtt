WEBVTT

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.900
AUTOPSY ROOM 3

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.270
Fang Over Fang!

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.700
Ma, above you!

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.700
I know!

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.230
He used the corpse as a shield.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.070
I figured as much.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.200
The reports were right.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.270
Physical attacks seem to be his weakness!

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.130
Then we, the Inuzuka clan,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.000
couldn't have asked for a better opponent!

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.970
Ma, let's put him away in one stroke!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.400
Hold it, Kiba!

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.500
He is one of the six who brought down Lord Jiraiya.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.500
We're going to be cautious, yet bold.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.700
I expect you to fill in for Hana who has gone to protect the puppies!

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.930
R-Right!

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.500
Shino, we’re going to exterminate her with our full power.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.970
Yes.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.730
TEA HOUSE TEA HOUSE I'm so hungry!

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.100
Let's rest a bit. We’re all tired from the mission.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.300
What's the matter, Guy Sensei?

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.700
Have you noticed large numbers of birds

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.370
have been flying away from the direction of the village?

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.230
As though they were fleeing.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.900
I also have this bad feeling…

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.670
We should head straight for the village.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.430
What?!

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.070
Let's go, everyone!

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.230
Aw geez!

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.530
Behind you!

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.770
Six piercings in the nose, seven in the ear… It’s him.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.670
You’re…

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.370
It's been a long time, Lady Tsunade.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.600
You are the last remaining of the Legendary Sannin.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.870
I wish to take a moment to speak with you.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.990
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.080
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.500
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.420
And yet we're stuck here — unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.220
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.520
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.730
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.360
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:47.990
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.990
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.160
Even in a world without you, we run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.380
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.880
koete Someday...

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.320
Pain to the World

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.680
Kiba! We'll go with that technique!

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.280
Yeah… I know!

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.250
Let's do it, Akamaru!

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.550
Dynamic Marking!

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.650
You won't get away!

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.180
I have control of the situation.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.650
I will take care of these two.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.620
Got it, thanks!

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.880
As long as you have Akamaru’s marking,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.550
there’s no place for you to escape!

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.120
This isn't Pain.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.180
Because her characteristics differ from what we’ve been informed about.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.250
Stay alert.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.880
Of course. I won't let my guard down for anyone.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.920
Paper Clones…

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.820
No matter how many clones there are,

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.850
our beetles will devour them all!

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.480
This smell…

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.050
Get away, Shino!

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.320
The Paper Clones were armed with Paper Bombs from the start.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.920
The real one was already saturated with water.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.380
She used her weakness to gain an advantage.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.180
This one is strong.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.150
You are that boy…

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.180
…from long ago.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.620
It seems you remember me.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.780
You know him?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.920
A little…

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.550
Who is he?

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.480
A god who restores order.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.450
It seems he's not in his right mind.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.320
Naruto Uzumaki… Where is the Nine-Tails?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.380
Who knows…?

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.220
The hunt for the Jinchuriki is about over.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.020
The Tailed Beasts are no longer equalizers

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.380
in maintaining the power balance between the ninja villages.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.580
It's meaningless to protect the Nine-Tails now.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.080
So your target is Naruto, after all?

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.450
The war will begin very soon.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.750
Seeds of war exist everywhere, ready to explode.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.380
And we shall control those wars.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.320
If you cooperate with us, we would not be averse to helping you.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.080
From the state of this village…

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.880
You should know what we are capable of.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.420
Don’t underestimate the Five Kages!

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.750
You terrorists seek to destroy the peace

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.080
our predecessors strived to bring and maintain!

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.180
Your words fall on deaf ears!

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.220
Such arrogance!

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.480
Such chakra…

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.950
This is the power of the Rinnegan?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.420
I've never seen anything like it.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.420
I have a bad feeling…

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.120
Your peace has brought violence upon us.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.380
I will admit that

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.780
some of the past actions of the Hidden Leaf were not just.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.580
But your actions here are unforgivable!

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.920
Be careful of what you say.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.680
This is your final warning from a god.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.720
Tell me where Naruto is.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:27.780
Speak!

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.880
We will pour every ounce of power we have into bringing you down!

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.020
That is all I have to say!

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.520
One other thing… You have made a huge error!

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.650
What you desire, you shall never get!

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.520
If you think the Hidden Leaf has what it takes to protect Naruto, then…

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.450
Wrong!

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.880
Naruto…is strong.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.920
HIDDEN LEAF CIPHER DIVISION

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.620
There are six Pains.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.580
Each one can only use one type of jutsu.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.320
That woman used Summoning Jutsu.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:23.450
That means the Pain killed by Lord Jiraiya was resurrected in a different body.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.680
And there’s no mistake…

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.320
that woman was transported to Hidden Rain’s tower as a corpse.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.350
Did that woman's corpse have this imbedded in her?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.580
No… I'm sure she didn't.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.650
This proves that Lord Fukasaku was right.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.480
Pain has the power to bring the dead back to life.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.550
Furthermore, he is able to substitute bodies as often as he wants,

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.080
and controls them by planting these black chakra receivers.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.850
Then those six Pains are…

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.420
It's possible all of them are actually dead bodies.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.620
And if they have receivers, they must also have transmitters.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.980
So someone is in the shadows,

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.420
sending chakra signals and manipulating them.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.650
Yes.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.180
The coded message left behind by Lord Jiraiya,

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.080
"The real one's not among them…”

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.250
Perhaps it meant that none of the six Pains is the real Pain.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.680
What?! You mean there are still others out there?!

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.280
Exactly.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.620
I did anticipate that possibility…

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.320
But as the worst-case scenario, I really didn’t want it to be true.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.480
And that someone possesses considerable chakra.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.320
They are able to control this many bodies remotely, this freely,

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.650
using just their chakra.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.280
It's similar to our, the Yamanaka clan’s, Mind Transfer Jutsu.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.280
But normally you can only manipulate one person with chakra.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.620
There are six Pains.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.820
Does this mean there are six others in the shadows?

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:56.980
We don't know that.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.880
In any case, if this is a Mind Transfer Jutsu,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.050
he has to be pretty close to the receiver in order to transmit chakra.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.880
Otherwise, it would be impossible to pull off that magnitude of jutsu and attacks.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.550
He must be hidden somewhere close to the Leaf Village.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.150
We need to notify Lady Tsunade immediately,

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.880
and organize a search party to find the hidden Pain.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.250
What?!

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.080
How did we not notice him?!

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.120
Do not make a move…

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.220
or this woman will die.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.450
Damn it!

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.080
Mount Myoboku…

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.980
The same jutsu that Father uses!

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.350
But he was able to search her mind in seconds without any device?!

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.950
It seems Naruto is not here.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.550
Mount Myoboku.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.820
What?!

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.020
What?!

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:28.350
They retreated?

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.120
What's going on?

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:39.020
Mount Myoboku… That is the hidden village of the toads.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.880
Well then, lingering here is useless.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.620
How did you know?

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:46.520
Why you…

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.850
Lady Tsunade…

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.520
We should let them retreat and in the meantime, fortify the village.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.450
May I ask you one last question?

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.920
That chakra in your legs…

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.380
Was it to counter my jutsu?

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.320
It seems you've realized my ability.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.420
However, all is meaningless before overwhelming power.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.950
You great nations proved that over the years.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.420
You all think that you have the leading roles in this world,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.550
and do not think twice about death.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.520
Soothed by peace, you become shallow.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.380
If you kill people, you shall be killed.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.320
Hatred brings about this cause and effect.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.480
Quit babbling such nonsense.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.980
In battle, both sides suffer death, injury, and pain.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.920
And we of the Great Nations have had our share of pain!

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.520
Stop finding excuses for your actions!

00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.950
That is laughable.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.480
Lady Shizune!

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.050
Feel pain.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.780
Contemplate pain.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.880
Accept pain. Know pain!

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.150
Wait, Pain!

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.150
Accept pain. Know pain!

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.880
He’s still planning something?

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.020
One who does not know pain cannot possibly understand true peace!

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.380
Bad news! Lord Fukasaku!

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.920
What is wrong?

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.120
Big brother Kosuke, our messenger, has been killed.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.780
What?!

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.720
His name…

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.650
AMACHAN GAMASPEED GAMAKOSUKE vanished from the register.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.080
AMACHAN    GAMASPEED

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:13.120
Does that mean something has happened to the Leaf Village?

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.480
What?!

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.180
Naruto-boy, I have a bad feeling.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.220
Geezer Sage…

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.120
Don't tell me the Akatsuki attacked the village!

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:28.350
Luckily, Ma went to gather provisions and is near the Leaf Village.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.780
She will be capable of summoning strong warriors, including us.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.520
Get ready now!

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.920
Right!

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.750
LEAF HOSPITAL

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.180
Damn it…

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.020
I won’t get to all of them like this!

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.620
Lady Shizune!

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.250
What?!

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.680
What's going on?

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.550
I’m going to use that jutsu.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:17.850
What?

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.220
They seem to have retreated.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.680
Yes… But it doesn't make sense.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.620
Lady Shizune…

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.520
Their scents are completely gone.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.220
They’re not around here.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.850
I guess my power scared them off!

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.580
Leave it to Ma… Just like that time with Pa.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.420
What does this mean?

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.650
It’s hard to think they would just retreat.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.780
Pain…

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.120
One who does not know pain cannot possibly understand true peace!

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.950
They intend to do something…

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:16.820
Something?

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:21.520
I don't know. But it's something huge!

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.180
I'm counting on you!

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.080
Make sure Ma gets the message!

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.450
Yes, sir!

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.150
Katsuyu! Protect everyone!

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.150
Lady Tsunade!

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.850
Something terrible is about to happen!

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.220
What is keeping Naruto?

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.780
I must get word to her immediately.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.250
That's coming from the Leaf Village.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.850
Oh my goodness…

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.820
Lady Shima!

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.080
I came through the distance teleporting pool.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.680
I have a message from Lord Fukasaku.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.620
To summon them, eh?

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.020
Pain! What do you intend to do?!

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.480
You can't! That jutsu will shorten your life!

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.680
The power of the six is…

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.150
You’re really going to do this, aren’t you, Nagato?

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.080
I will never forget Yahiko's pain.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.380
And now…

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.080
This world shall know pain.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.320
Summoning Jutsu!

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.920
Almighty Push…

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.780
Wh-What is this?

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.620
How could this hap—

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.520
Naruto… Hurry…

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.550
Please, Naruto!

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.730
There’s no need for the Leaf’s Hokage to bother herself

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:40.730
with the likes of them.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.870
You just sit back and sip some tea, Granny.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.870
I’ll take over from here.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.130
Tell everyone in the village to stay out of the way.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.700
It’ll be difficult to fight while trying to cover for them.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.470
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: “Explosion! Sage Mode”

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.630
Let’s settle this!

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.030
Tune in again!
