00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.410
The Day Naruto Was Born

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.460
Minato… You intended for your brat to clean up after your mess, right?

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.630
That's why you sealed my other half inside him…

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.640
as if you were confident they would be able to work together.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.060
Nine Tails…

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.350
Then don't regret it now.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.310
It's not your fault that Kushina died.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.190
And making your brat into a Jinchuriki wasn't a bad thing either.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.660
Because your brat is trying to change...

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.870
what this world has become right now.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.710
He's not that newborn babe anymore.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.120
In fact, tomorrow is...

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.500
Naruto…

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.170
Listen up... I need to tell you something...

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.560
I knew it! I figured as much.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.440
I can't believe the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki has such a weakness!

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.200
And with Ten Tails inside me, I can't pass through things either!

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.290
How frustrating!

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.290
Sage moves will work!

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.080
Sage Power?

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.130
The toad attacks are Sage Jutsu…

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.920
They use Nature Energy.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.840
Come to think of it, when I tried to sense Ten Tails' power,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.970
it was Nature Energy itself.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.890
So you can maybe counter Nature Energy with Nature Energy.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.190
Not that I really understand it.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.520
I'm just glad I learned Sage Jutsu! All right!

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.730
Next up is Frog Kumite!

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.950
He instantly grasped how to use the Flying Raijin with me...

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.660
and has even mastered Sage Power.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.920
I feel like I'm fighting alongside Elder Brother!

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.260
It clearly worked. But he's recovered already,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.810
and now he's guarding his back.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.440
If we teleport behind him carelessly, we might get erased.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.530
I should start preparing for the Tsukuyomi.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.240
Let's tidy things up.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.470
There is nothing worth saving in this reality.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.940
This world is already dead.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.160
Hey… This is super bad!

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.280
Four of them…all at once?

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.370
Even if we were to create an Earth Style Wall,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.660
it wouldn't be enough!

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.200
There are too many of them!

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.000
What do we do? Think!

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.210
It would take one person per each of those

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.630
to teleport away using the Flying Raijin.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.970
The Fourth and I can get to two of them,

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.050
but that leaves two others! Impossible!

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.600
Where's Elder Brother?

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.020
Madara! Could you wait a moment?

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.350
Your comrade is acting up...!

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.650
We are all Reanimations!

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.110
There's no need to worry!

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.820
Keep fighting!

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.280
Do not give up everyone!

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.160
I am with you! My clones are with you!

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.570
We only need to change the spheres' trajectories!

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.120
The other Hokage will also take measures

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.240
and repel them across the ocean!

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.870
I ask that you all work on putting up an Earth Style Wall!

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.500
I'll use the Deep Forest Emergence to launch

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.710
and guide them to toward the ocean!

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.250
I won't let you!

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.850
Six Crimson Ray Formation!

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.900
A barrier!

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.440
Hey! Don't tell me we're...

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.110
He's trapped everyone inside the barrier,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.120
and he's made it so we can't expel the Tailed Beast Bombs!

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.160
Endgame.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.120
Our only choice now is to teleport those spheres

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.040
outside the barrier using the Flying Raijin.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.670
Fourth, can you handle two of them?

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.840
Since we can't mark them, I can only take one.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.220
There's only one way.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.430
We could...

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.270
You intend to teleport the stalk itself outside?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.140
You think I'd let you do that?

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.770
You can't save anyone!

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.820
Dad!

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.240
I don't know if it will work, but I've got an idea.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.830
Will you bump fists with me?

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.600
Hey, other half. How ya been?

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.020
Do you mind sharing some of your chakra with me?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.820
To be asked a favor from myself feels a bit weird...

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.700
Naruto…

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.320
Minato's useless, he can't do anything.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.120
He couldn't even protect your mom...

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.370
Nor his own subordinates.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.300
You know what tomorrow is, don't you?

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.010
It's the anniversary of Minato and Kushina's deaths.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.770
The day both of your parent's died.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.240
In this world, it's over when you die.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.120
You see... Oh, right, which means...

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.160
it's also the day I was born!

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.340
So you see...

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.260
It's not over...

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.180
'Cuz I exist in this world!

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.070
Our Naruto has become really strong...

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.280
...Kushina.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.410
Let's go, Dad!

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.700
Yeah!

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.390
Thank goodness for the chakra of you two!

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.520
It's just as I thought!

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.310
Yeah well, the both of us used to be one, after all.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.450
Plus...those two are father and son.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.870
He's planning to trap us inside this barrier

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.160
and blow us up along with it!

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.040
What can we do?

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.960
The Hokage's barrier didn't let Tailed Beast Bombs through either…

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.640
This barrier is red all over…

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.020
I think it's accurate to say that

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.110
this one's likely to be on par with the Hokages.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.780
With the level of our strength,

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.320
it's impossible for us to smash through it, in which case...

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.700
Damn it! Nothing's coming to mind, Dad!

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.040
What's your plan, Naruto?

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.340
Just...give me some time to focus...

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.100
Let me explain what Kurama and I came up with.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.180
You tell me if it will work or not, okay?

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.900
All right, go ahead!

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.110
Have you seen him, Kushina?

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.620
Our Naruto's really grown up.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.080
I'm so sorry, Naruto...

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:31.090
I'm sure you must have had it real tough up until now!

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.880
The real tough part is about to start, Dad!

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.400
This is Naruto's…!

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.320
So…it wasn't depleted?!

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.740
I noticed it when I was healing everyone, but…

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.740
It seems it had merely shrunk down.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.580
It's bigger and more powerful than before!

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.540
Have ya noticed Eight-o?

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.170
I sense two Nine Tails, one light and one dark, yo!

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.840
This isn't just Nine Tails.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.590
You're thinking about protecting us from that attack

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.840
with this chakra, Naruto?

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.180
Jugo.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.270
Sasuke, this is looking bad. Let's get outside of this barrier.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.610
Use the Snake Reverse Summoning.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.320
That was my plan already.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.200
I'll take you and Naruto with me.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.240
I haven't given you any of my chakra yet.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.540
Get over here, will ya?

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.580
What's your chakra going to accomplish?

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.040
There's no time! Just hurry!

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.510
I can't believe he shared his chakra with every shinobi!

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.090
He's got almost as much chakra as us!

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.510
No!

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.140
Actually, this has Nine Tails' chakra mixed in!

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.560
That won't help you withstand the shock wave of

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.150
four Ten Tails' Tailed Beast Bombs exploding together!

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.530
Begone...

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.630
What?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.430
What happened?

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.060
This chakra protected us again!

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.730
Not quite, check it out!

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.310
Choji… Look over there.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.440
We're...

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.860
outside the barrier.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.990
It was the Teleportation Jutsu.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.410
Damn that Naruto! He's even mastered that too?

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.040
This isn't just Naruto's chakra.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.670
He moved everyone using the Fourth Hokage's Flying Raijin Jutsu!

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.050
Fourth…

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.970
This is the second time you've saved all of shinobi-kind.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.350
I've still failed...

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.850
more times than that,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.520
so I must continue making up for it.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.150
What did you do?

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.200
Dad teleported everyone outside the barrier.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.200
Everyone? With that jutsu?

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.750
I can't teleport anything that I myself,

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.210
or my chakra isn't touching, even indirectly.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.170
How?

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.800
I'd shared Kurama's and my chakra with everyone earlier.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:54.180
So if Dad, and our chakra and everybody were to uh...um...

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.310
Indirectly…

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.310
Right! If we were all in indirect contact with each other,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.650
it would work.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.490
So, I connected Dad's chakra with Kurama's and mine.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.030
That's all!

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.530
He used the principle of Shadow Clones.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.740
Even if you split up and disperse your chakra...

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.200
as long as you keep even a little bit there without putting it out...

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.040
when the original body infuses chakra again to regain control,

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.460
all the individual chakra bits begin resonating and link together.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:26.340
In short, by joining his chakra with the Fourth's,

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.260
Naruto linked the Fourth to the rest of his chakra

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.260
residing in everyone else.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.640
Right, Naruto?

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.850
Huh? Is that what I did?

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.060
Never mind…

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.310
Old Man Second, you sure know a lot about my Shadow Clones too!

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.070
I created that jutsu!

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.900
It's my Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.200
Will you bump fists with me?

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.330
Yeah!

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.760
Yeah, let's try it!

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:15.970
There's nothing we can't do if we borrow Nine Tails'...

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.430
I mean, Kurama's power.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.350
All right!

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.810
Then let's all four of us join forces!

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.190
"All four of us," eh? You treat us like we're human too.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.530
What kind of childrearing has led to this, eh?

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:32.450
Naruto…

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.780
Huh?!

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.040
I wish there was more time...

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.290
to talk to the grown-up you... Guys don't need to talk!

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.210
I already know!

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.760
I…already met Mom's chakra.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.680
Kushina…my time is running out…

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.610
I'm going start the Eight Signed Seal.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.900
I want to put some of my chakra in Naruto too.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.530
It'll be quite a while before we can see him.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.240
Let's tell him what we want to say…

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.410
Naruto…

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.370
Don't be picky. Eat lots and grow strong.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:25.420
Make sure you bathe every day and stay warm.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.050
Also…don't stay up late. You need lots of sleep.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.470
And…make friends.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.600
You don't need a lot of friends. Just a few…

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.890
Ones you can really, really trust.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.400
I wasn't very good at it, but keep up with your studies

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.440
and practice your ninjutsu hard.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.820
Remember that everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.160
So don't get too depressed if you can't do something well.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:04.120
Respect your teachers and upperclassmen at the Academy.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.250
Oh, and this is important…

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.340
It's about the Three Prohibitions for a shinobi.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.590
Be extra careful about lending and borrowing money.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.300
Put your mission wages into your savings account.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.310
No alcohol until you're of age.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.060
Too much can ruin your health, so drink in moderation.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.270
Another Prohibition is women.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.990
I'm a woman, so I don't know too much about this but…

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.780
All you need to remember is that this world

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.830
is made up of men and women.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.790
So it's only natural to take an interest in girls…

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.580
But just don't get hooked on bad women.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.340
Find someone just like me.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.300
Speaking of the Three Prohibitions,

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.890
Be wary of Jiraiya Sensei.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:07.350
Naruto…from now on, you're going to face lots of pain and hardship…

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.320
Be true to yourself…

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.530
Have a dream…and…

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:18.110
have the confidence to make that dream come true!

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.160
There's so much… oh, so much more…

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:28.250
There's so much more that I want to pass on to you…

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.920
I wish I could stay with you longer…

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.300
I love you.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.630
Minato, I'm sorry I used up your time…

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.760
It's okay.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.770
Naruto, my words to you as your father are...

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:49.440
I guess it's the same as your nagging mother's.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.280
What you want to say is the same as my nagging mom, right?!

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.360
I already know!

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.880
What exactly is it?

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.670
This is the Divine Tree! Ten Tails' final form!

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.590
Chakra first originated with this Divine Tree!

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.430
What?

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.760
We humans stole chakra from the Divine Tree long ago.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.980
This thing is just trying to get it back, that's all.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.270
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Divine Tree"

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.570
Do you know how and why shinobi came to be, Hashirama?

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:08.320
THE DIVINE TREE Tune in again!
