WEBVTT

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.170
We have to walk again?

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.630
I'm exhausted.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.070
Humph... We're going to the northern hideout now.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.600
At this rate, you'll be killed the moment we get there.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.130
I only know it through maps... but is the place really that bad?

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.770
The northern hideout is no ordinary hideout.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.830
That place...

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.770
is where human experiments are conducted.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.600
And the unmanageable monsters that result are kept locked up there.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.400
A male...

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.670
No, a female.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.470
No, I'll kill a male next, after all.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.270
I see.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.170
It's already begun...

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.430
Why... Why did you have to die?

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.600
RAMEN That's pretty heavy food to have in the morning.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.500
Sakura, today's our day off. How come you're up so early?

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.100
It's already noon.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.030
Well, never mind.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.370
Just wash up quickly and get dressed. I'll be waiting.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.170
Huh? Is it a date?

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.670
Idiot! Lady Tsunade has summoned us!

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.730
Say, aren't you tired?

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.170
How about a short break?

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.500
You're already taking a break!

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.070
You are so hopeless!

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.300
We've still got a ways to go 'til we get to the northern hideout!

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.130
My destination is different from yours.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.000
No need to bother with me. Just go on ahead.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.000
I remembered that I too have business at the northern hideout!

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.370
So I'm going to take care of that first!

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.830
Move...!

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.500
I'll kill you too!

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.500
Stop it, Jugo...

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.230
That's...

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.870
enough.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.400
You're not alone.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.470
You have me.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.200
Without you...

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I can never leave this place...

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.770
Suigetsu...

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.730
Why do you follow Sasuke?

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.870
I have a goal.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.700
And if I stick with Sasuke, I can fulfill that goal.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.000
Say, I should be asking you the same question... Really.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.800
I don't know what your goals are...

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.330
But you want me to join your team despite knowing about Jugo?

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.370
I know him a little. We fought each other once.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.500
He had an unusual ability and was quite formidable.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.800
But I couldn't figure out what he was thinking,

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.500
and I didn't really like him.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.370
I understand he sought out Orochimaru.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.930
He's got to be crazy.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.330
According to rumors,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.730
Jugo usually has that unusual impulse well under control.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.700
But when he loses it, he transforms into a ruthless killer.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.370
His personality and appearance change completely.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.830
In other words, he's a maniac who loves to kill people.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.930
But to Orochimaru, Jugo's ability was enticing.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.530
He invented an enzyme, based on Jugo's body fluids,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.670
which induced the same condition in other Shinobi.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.330
You guys know it too, right?

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.770
That's...the Curse Mark.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.630
Jugo is the one and only original carrier.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.970
I'm getting out of here! I'll kill anyone who tries to stop me!

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.870
Who's...next?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.230
Jugo of the Northern Hideout You're late!

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.570
What took you two so long?! Cripes!

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.500
I-I'm sorry.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.030
Naruto was eating lunch, which he calls breakfast...

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.470
Now now... Tsunade...

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.970
Huh? Pervy Sage?! You're back!

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.770
It's been awhile, eh, Naruto?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.170
Aw man! Why didn't you tell me you were back?

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.670
We had a hard time after you left.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.470
So I hear.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.930
I got the gist of it, but I understand you played a big part.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.200
That's for sure.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.500
I finally got my Collaboration Jutsu to work in sync with the two toads.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.970
Oh, is that so?! You finally did it!

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.230
How about it? Wanna see my new Jutsu?

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.800
Well, since I'm here... I don't mind if I do.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.200
I knew it!

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.530
And naturally, after that, we'll go eat ramen at Ichiraku!

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.730
Sure, it'll be my treat.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.500
- All right! Let's get going! - Let's go! Your new Jutsu, eh...?

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.300
- I'm looking forward to this... - Hey!!

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.970
- Ow! - Oh!

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.230
Say, can we rest a bit?

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.930
Suigetsu! You keep stopping to rest!

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.530
We're almost at the hideout!

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.170
Is it the sword? Is it too heavy for you?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.470
Then leave it, damn it!

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.870
Tell him, Sasuke!

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.900
What's wrong?

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.200
Where's the guy who's on watch?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.200
Huh?

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.430
You're right... That's strange.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.330
Hey...

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.200
He's from the northern hideout. He's still breathing.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.670
What happened?

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.630
Y-You're...Sasuke Uchiha...

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.830
Help me...

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.300
What happened?

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.970
I-It all started...

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.600
with the rumors that Orochimaru was dead.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.700
The prisoners went wild...

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.570
At this rate...

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.230
Oh dear... He died.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.130
You're...

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.500
What is that?

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.030
He's already in the "Curse Mark Second State."

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.800
The northern hideout is over there.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.130
Let's go and see Jugo.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.030
Huh? Hey! Wait, Sasuke!

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.170
Huh? Who is this guy?

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.670
A male...

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.800
The next one I kill will be a guy, after all...

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.370
All right, decided.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.630
If the next one who comes through that door is a woman,

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.670
I'll kill her.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.970
The guards have all been killed...

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.030
and the prisoners have escaped.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.370
Then there's no way we can tell which one is Jugo...

00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:59.870
Eh, Sasuke?

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.500
Karin, is Jugo among them?

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.500
Cripes, what a pain! Just wait a bit!

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.800
Nope, he's not.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.970
Well then, I can fight without worrying who they are.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.530
Just avoid killing them.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.200
You're from the Hidden Leaf, after all...

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.300
You should've killed that guy back there too, you know.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.000
So naïve...

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.500
Let's go.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.470
Stay away! You all stink!

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.630
You're strong... You're...

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.830
The keys!

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.730
I found them!

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.770
Kill...

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.100
Kill...

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.130
Karin, which way? Lead the way.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.030
Sasuke! Why're you ordering me around, huh?!

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.170
Can you just hurry and check?

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.200
That's the ability you pride yourself on, right?

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.870
That way!

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:36.800
What is it?

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.200
Actually, it's this way.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.100
Let's go, Sasuke!

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.930
Why did you lie? Suigetsu went...

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.070
Suigetsu has a big mouth, that's why I don't like him.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.900
Let's go!

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.330
Let go... I can walk on my own.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:00.800
So...the Curse Mark really does transform the body into such an ugly shape...

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.270
Sasuke, does your Curse Mark do the same to you?

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.000
Sasuke... Are you listening...?

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.530
That witch...!

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.730
A woman...

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.100
If a woman enters,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.330
I'll kill her...!

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.700
Here?

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.330
Yeah, Jugo's inside.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.830
There...

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.100
Now then, which will it be?

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.370
All right! I'm gonna open it!

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.370
I'll go in first. Karin, stay back.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.230
S-Sure!

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.070
No...

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:12.270
It's gotta be a guy. If it's a guy, I'll kill him.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.800
Bingo! I'm gonna kill!

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.300
He's coming!

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.170
Huh? I'm back where I started.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.800
I should've turned right back there.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.200
Damn that witch!

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.170
Y-You guys...

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:41.570
Just what is your purpose in coming here?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.370
We came to take Jugo outta here, so that he can join our team.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:55.970
Do you guys realize... what you're doing?

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.570
If you let that guy... out into the world...

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.170
I totally agree.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.100
But I'll convince him... with force, if necessary.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:13.370
You may be strong, but you're hardly...

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:20.330
Listen... If it weren't for Sasuke's words, you'd be dead right now.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.530
Jugo will kill you all!

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.400
I really could care less if one person died.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.930
Sasuke!

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.730
I-I'm so sorry! Naruto always gets so rowdy...

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.070
Hey, Naruto, you idiot! Say you're sorry too!!

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.300
Oww... Sakura that hurt!

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.130
And? What did you want to talk about?

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.730
Huh? Mmm...

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.770
What's wrong, Granny Tsunade?

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.100
Don't you have something to talk about?

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.500
Well...

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:21.370
There's certain information that is being spread throughout the region...

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.730
It's about that.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.430
Information?

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.000
What? What about?

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.400
Orochimaru is dead.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.200
It seems Sasuke Uchiha killed him.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.100
Is...

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.730
Is that...true?

00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:00.230
There's no mistake about it. I heard it from a reliable source.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.130
Then...

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.930
Heh! After all, there's no way he'd get killed by Orochimaru!

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.030
That means Sasuke will be coming back to the Hidden Leaf! Right?

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.700
That doesn't seem to be the case...

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.230
It's not over yet!

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.470
Sasuke's Chakra...

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.770
...changed!

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.670
Not another copy of me...!

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.400
Sasuke... But you're quite a guy

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.800
to be able to do a Partial Transformation!

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.500
You're good at controlling your Curse Mark!

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.530
I have no intention of fighting.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.000
I only wish to talk to you, Jugo.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.900
But you're quite a guy!

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.670
You're good at controlling your Curse Mark!

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.200
I have no intention of fighting. I only wish to talk to you.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.200
Talk?

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.200
Jugo, I'm getting you out of here.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.400
Are you an idiot?! You don't know anything!

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.630
What do you mean?

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.430
He's gone. That's why... I can never leave this place!

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.200
Next time: "Formation!"

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.970
Captain Yamato gave me some raffle tickets!

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.470
Naturally, I'm going for first prize...

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.600
A year's supply of Cup Noodles!!

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.030
Huh? This must be it.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.670
RAFFLE TICKET BOOTH Welcome...! Oh, it's just you, Naruto.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.230
Don't give me that attitude!

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.930
By the way, are my cup noodles still here?

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.300
Whether it's yours or not depends on your luck.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.900
FIRST PRIZE But, no first-prize winners yet!

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.130
All right!!

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.870
Okay. You get three tries.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.170
Come on ramen!

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.800
Sorry! Here's a candy for drawing a blank.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.400
Damn it! Next one for sure!

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.670
You lose! Here's your second candy.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.300
I'm putting everything on this last try!

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.430
- Oh! - Oh!

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.170
Jack pot!!

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.170
Yay!
- Here. - Huh?!

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.870
Grand prize is the Make-Out Tactics Book Set

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.170
signed by Master Jiraiya!

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.600
What?! Who needs this?!

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.670
This is stupid! I'm going home!

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.830
GRAND PRIZE Huh? They already won the grand prize?

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.570
And here I got these raffle tickets... How depressing!

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.430
Tune in again!
