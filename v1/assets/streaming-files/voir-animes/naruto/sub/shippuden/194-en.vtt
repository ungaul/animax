WEBVTT

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.200
So they'll use these tags to seal us.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.200
All right! Well done, young Kazekage!

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.280
What?

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.490
What's going on?!

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.580
I'm totally ready to be sealed!

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.990
Our bodies are programmed to automatically counter an enemy's jutsu!

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.120
Here they come!

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.660
Surround those two!

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.740
Particle Style… Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.990
You've aged, Ohnoki.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.370
Nonsense…

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.700
You'd better get the Kazekage here to use his sensory skills

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530
or you'll die, Ohnoki!

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.520
The Mizukage, the Giant Clam and the Mirage

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.430
Hey!

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.480
Don't underestimate my jutsu! You really should stand back!

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.560
For real!

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.770
For real?

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.680
Here are my weaknesses!

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.310
For real!

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.730
For real?

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.930
For real.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.270
Now listen! I'm a Shadow Style user, in other words, I use genjutsu.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.140
And my summoning is…

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.180
a Giant Clam!

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.680
I'm a Lightning User!

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.180
Line up your Earth Style shinobi and use them as a shield…

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.270
and attack with your Wind Style shinobi!

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.640
Thanks for your thoughtfulness! In fact, I'd like to know more!

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.020
I have no control over my body!

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.180
I can't waste any more time talking!

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.600
Come!

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.680
Wind and Earth Style shinobi, follow me!

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.270
Sealing Unit, keep up with us!

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.980
That's right. Go away, Raikage.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.270
If you and I stick together, these guys won't be able to seal us.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.180
So, do you have a strategy…

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.560
Fifth Kazekage?

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.600
I'm leaving you guys in charge here.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.180
Huh?! Commander!

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.180
We have to deal with him without you?!

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.350
Hey, hey! What kind of tactic is that?!

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.520
Didn't you hear me?! I am a Shadow User!

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.230
This Giant Clam can cast a genjutsu over a wide area!

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.680
It'll make you see illusions!

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.480
A physical attack won't work!

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.270
I'm talking about a mirage!

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.810
I can tell. You have no desire to kill.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.100
Of course not! That's to be expected!

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.890
I can't stand being manipulated by some other jutsu user.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.180
That's why I want you to seal me quickly, Kazekage! Hey!

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.230
Deal with him.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.180
Hey!

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.430
You can count on us!

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.810
Hey, wispy whiskers!

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.100
Wispy whiskers?

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.390
Don't call me that!

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.100
I don't care about the Reanimation anymore. I'll kill you!

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.310
He means it!

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.310
Man, this is awkward.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.100
Let's go, guys!

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.730
– Yeah! – Right!

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.100
Let's do it!

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.100
– Yeah! – Right!

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.810
I'm counting on you… Do something.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.810
Good! Now you look like you mean business!

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.980
Listen up, I'll tell you one more time!

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.060
Attacking this me is useless!

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.390
Your sensory skills are useless against me.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.770
You shouldn't underestimate me.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.730
Stone Clone Jutsu!

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.680
So you'll come at me in numbers… That might work.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.140
Did we get him?

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.140
No way!

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.180
I told you attacking this me is useless!

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.140
This me is just a mirage!

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.480
Then what do we have to do?!

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.140
So, defeat my Giant Clam first!

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.480
It's the one creating the mirage.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.560
But its shell is hard.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.230
Use large-scale weapons or Paper Bombs!

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.680
But… What?

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.560
We just used them with the last attack…

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.180
Just hurry up and retrieve the weapons!

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.180
I'm sorry!

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.600
Everyone, quickly!

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.770
Hurry!

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.980
Hey, that's mine.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.600
Where's my weapon?

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.640
Hey! There are a lot of 'em over that way too!

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.020
What are you doing here? Digging for clams?

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.100
Pardon us.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.730
This is awkward…

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.100
All right! Let's do it, everyone!

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.680
– Right! – Right!

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.140
Target the Giant Clam!

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.390
Take that!

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.140
Did we get it?

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:35.430
Huh?

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.390
Damn it! I can't stand this anymore!

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.230
– Why?! – Why?!

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.230
Hey! What's going on?

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.430
Yeah. So I keep telling you over and over again…

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.890
That Giant Clam is also a mirage, idiots!

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.100
Aim for the real one!

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.600
Yeah, so tell us where the real one is!

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.230
Like I said! Look around behind me!

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.850
It's camouflaged within a mirage and hiding!

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.520
Aww, damn it!

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.350
I told you attacking this me is useless!

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.310
Oh no, I was aiming for the Giant Clam in the back.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.680
Like I said, that's a mirage, idiot!

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.430
Aw man, I don't understand!

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.180
I don't get it!

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.850
– We don't get it! – We don't get it!

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.520
Look, you guys…

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.020
Wispy whiskers!

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.930
I'll kill you!

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.980
He means it!

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.680
– Who said that?! Apologize! – Come out and apologize! Hurry!

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:35.770
I'm sorry.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:38.980
This is awkward…

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.100
What the heck! Once more, an all-out attack!

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.230
Let's go!

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.060
Are you sure?

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.640
Are you really sure you want to do that?!

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.230
Where did that come from?!

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.310
Behind you, Tsuchikage!

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.310
Not now!

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.390
Particle Style!

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.350
Atomic Dismantling Jutsu.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.680
Is that…?!

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.100
Planet Rasengan!

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.350
Is that…Naruto?!

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.650
Damn it!

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.900
Lord Mu is a Sensory Shinobi.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.780
Gaara!

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.690
Sand!

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.280
Using Sand as a springboard for his attack?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.780
I see.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.570
Dodge this. My jutsu is faster than yours!

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.230
All right!

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.230
This is…

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.480
a violently rotating… Rasengan!

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.070
Earth Style… Boulder Jutsu!

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.190
Now you're so heavy,

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.860
you won't even be able to raise your arms.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.780
Owww…

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.730
You used to hate the other villages, now you work so well with them.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.820
It's worth living a long life.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.190
You get to enjoy change.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.070
Don't let down your guard. I'm still…

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.280
All right! Way to go, Gaara!

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.610
Oh yeah… Nice work too, Shorty Gramps!

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.570
I am the Tsuchikage, you know.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.280
By the way—

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.070
What are you doing on the battlefield?!

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.820
Why did you come?!

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.530
Err… Well…

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.860
Let me explain…

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.730
You better have a good enough explanation to persuade me!

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.320
That would be impossible.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.320
So I will do the talking.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.230
This is Shikaku Nara at HQ.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.190
Both you and the Tsuchikage were in the middle of fighting,

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.980
so I thought I'd save the complicated talk for later.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.110
Let's hear it then. But the fighting is not over.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.860
We must head out immediately.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.650
You can brief us on the way.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:09.110
You know, I'm not trying to win here.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.480
You're too strong for us.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.280
Yeah well… Still, you must seal me.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.440
Otherwise, I'll remain a puppet…

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.900
Okay, everyone, get up! Get up!

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.690
So that's how it is, eh?

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.280
I can't believe even the Raikage relented.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.480
All right, I understand.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.860
I'm going to cease transmitting now.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.110
Naruto.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.940
I have nothing against going from one battlefield to another

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.900
to identify the enemy using transformation.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.440
But as a former Jinchuriki, I know…

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.110
The Nine Tails' chakra…

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.610
Are you sure you can handle using it so frequently?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.940
I don't plan on dying until I become the Hokage.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.610
Don't treat me like a kid just because you're the Kazekage now.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.530
I'll take the right battlefront!

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.780
Gaara and Gramps Tsuchikage, take the left!

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.610
Naruto, the Third Raikage is there!

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:20.530
Got it!

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.730
And our opponent is the Second Mizukage, correct?

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.530
The Genjutsu User…

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.860
Yes… Ordinary methods won't work against him.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.150
– Oh, man… – Still?

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.780
I keep telling you it's a mirage.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.110
Go retrieve them!

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.280
I've had it.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.070
Hey, you there!

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.940
Huh? You mean me?

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.780
You're from the Hidden Mist, aren't you?

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.150
Aren't you familiar with my jutsu?

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.690
I know little about you, Lord Second.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.280
I mean, I only know about the current Lord Fifth.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.730
The secretiveness of the Hidden Mist is to blame for this.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.230
If I knew things would be like this,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.900
I would've left behind a bigger legend!

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.280
Not good…

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.360
Hey, you there!

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.940
Playtime is over! Come at me seriously now!

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.280
We have been serious!

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.730
I have no control over my body. It's casting jutsu on its own.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.360
Damn it! I can't stand this!

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.860
It's my Water Balloon Jutsu.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.480
Defend yourselves!

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.440
Commander Gaara!

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.860
Huh? What took you so long?!

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.690
I hope this time you'll seal me!

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.610
I intend to.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.440
I'm looking forward to it.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:22.530
Commander!

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.570
This is not the time to be looking somewhere else!

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.150
Hey…

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.570
Is that all you got?

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.320
I keep telling you my weaknesses, yet every single one of you…

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.400
You tell us, but you're still too strong!

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.190
This is closer to oil than water.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.190
Even if I use Sand as a barrier,

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.230
it'll just seep in and make it collapse.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.400
You went to tackle Mu first, didn't you?

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.570
You always want to go for the stronger one first.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.940
That's what you call battle!

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.280
And that's what we did.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.320
Isn't it obvious I'm the stronger one?!

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:50.150
That guy looks like a half-dead mummy. Am I right?

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.730
True…

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.570
I realize now that appearances can deceive.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.820
You certainly are strong.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.610
Finally, you understand.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.570
Huh?! What do you mean "appearances can be deceiving"?!

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.190
But you've got wispy whis—

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.230
Cut it out!

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.900
I told you… that this me is a mirage,

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.530
created by the Giant Clam's wide-range genjutsu.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.730
So physical attacks are useless!

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.110
Find the Giant Clam quickly and destroy it!

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.570
Otherwise, this will never end…

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.530
That's right. Your Sand…

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.030
I like to let my actions do the talking.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.190
Over there!

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.230
So you were already searching for it with your Sand.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.730
I wondered why you were just focused on the defensive.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.150
Well, finally a worthy foe!

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.860
Now hurry up and defeat me!

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.980
I used too much chakra in my fight against Lord Mu.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.030
I can't use the Particle Style now.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.480
Well, I have no choice.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.440
I have to smash it into pieces myself!

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.650
Earth Style! Stone Fist Jutsu!

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:28.820
One problem…

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.230
You've got to put your back into it a bit more.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.230
A light punch won't work, Lil' Ohnoki.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.860
You're not using the Particle Style…

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.280
Have you run out of juice?

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.360
I'm not that Lil' Ohnoki you used to make fun of long ago!

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.940
Earth Style… Super Weighted Boulder Jutsu!

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.610
Not bad, Ohnoki!

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.030
Uh-oh… I've done it now!

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.650
The genjutsu is undone.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.820
Oh, my back!

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.820
I always knew you'd be Tsuchikage.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.230
But you're nothing more than a geezer with a sore back right now!

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.780
I'll admit that was a punch with some power to it,

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.190
but you overdid it and strained your back!

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.230
Anyway! Hurry up and run!

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.980
I'm about to use the Hozuki Clan's Water Gun Jutsu!

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.980
I can't stop myself!

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.040
No matter how many times we attack, there's no effect!

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.460
We haven't inflicted any damage!

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.000
We need an even more powerful Wind Style user.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.500
I'm a pretty good Wind Style user myself, you know.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.380
Honestly, among the Allied Forces, there isn't a stronger Wind Style user.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.130
There is! It's me!

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.170
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Paradox"

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:03.000
PARADOX Is it a new Rasengan? Maybe with this jutsu…

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.500
PARADOX

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.830
Tune in again!
