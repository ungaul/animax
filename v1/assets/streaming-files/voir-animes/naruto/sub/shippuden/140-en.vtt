WEBVTT

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.670
Shinobi… We Shinobi we endure…

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.170
Shinobi suppressing our sobs!

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.570
You don’t just sing enka. Enka requires a passion-filled soul!

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.970
Now you try singing.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.170
Yeah!

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.070
Shinobi, by being so stealthy…

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.330
we extend our life expectancy.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.430
You lack passion.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.230
Passion!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.300
You're just mouthing the lyrics and not taking it seriously!

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.770
Passion?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.470
That’s right! Passion!

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.030
As the characters in “enka” imply,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.700
it’s important to act out the world in the song with passion!

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.330
Also, the tremolo, you have to clench your belly

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.130
and bring the note into your nose, all right?

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.170
What’s the matter, Ponta?

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.830
He’s one of the Akatsuki, Master Kin.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.970
This personal biz will take a second,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.470
what a miff, but no worries I’ll erase him in a jiff!

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.470
I searched high and low for you, Eight-Tails.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.070
My great blade Samehada loves powerful chakra.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.130
And it seems to have finally caught scent of some delicious chakra.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.630
I'm sorry, but you're going to be food for my Samehada.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.870
Not to worry though, I won't kill you.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.200
But I'll kill you.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.470
I'll show you that we're worlds apart in power.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.400
So prepare ya-self, fool, ya fool!

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.470
My rhymes are…

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.830
Ponta!

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.170
You sure are chatty for a Jinchuriki.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.430
There's a peculiar bear upstaging you!

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.630
Sakura's Feelings

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.830
After what we learned about Danzo, who was your initial choice?

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.430
The question of who will lead the Allied Shinobi Forces is still an issue.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.500
Is there any among the current Kage you consider competent enough?

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.400
Mifune, you criticized every Kage including me.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.600
I believe appointing Lord Ei would be the wisest move.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.630
Didn't you say that Ei was unsuitable

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.500
because he gives in to his emotions and relies on power?

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.130
There is no longer any doubt that the Eight-Tails is alive.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.400
Furthermore, he skillfully built a consensus earlier

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.670
and was quick to come up with a counter strategy.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.230
And Lord Ei is the only one capable of controlling the Eight-Tails,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.200
which is key to this battle.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.000
Mizukage, Kazekage… Are you in agreement?

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.400
This is not the time to argue.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.970
I trust Lord Raikage.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.300
We'll leave it to you, Raikage.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.070
Understood. I will lead the Allied Forces.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.470
Ohnoki the Fence Sitter,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.470
since you are the only one who has battled Madara Uchiha,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.570
we'll need any intel you can give us.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.270
I expect your cooperation.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.870
He certainly enjoys barking orders at everyone.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.570
If you don't trust me, fine.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.630
But if we don't do something,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.000
the ninja world as we know it will disappear.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.330
Now is the time to put personal differences aside and cooperate!

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.870
Well, it's certainly better than losing this war.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.900
Our arguments are nothing compared to a world without ninja.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.100
So I shall cooperate.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.070
The Allied Shinobi Forces are hereby formed.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.770
First, we must notify the Feudal Lords.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.530
Huh?

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.270
W-What did you just say, Sakura?

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.100
I think I heard wrong. Could you say it again?

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.070
I said…

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.400
I…

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.570
love you, Naruto.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.130
I said Sasuke doesn’t mean anything to me anymore.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.200
I must have been crazy to carry a torch for him for so long.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.030
Listen carefully when someone confesses her feelings for you!

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.970
But why? What for?!

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
This isn't the place to be joking around. It's not funny, Sakura.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.600
What's going on?

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.300
Nothing really!

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.000
I just woke up.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.270
Why should I love a Rogue Ninja who’s a criminal?

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.300
I'm not a child anymore. I can face reality.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.730
So Naruto, you can forget about that promise you made to me.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.330
You can stop chasing after Sasuke, all right?

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.030
What's going on?

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.530
Do you think Naruto will calmly accept our decision?

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.700
But this is something we all decided.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.770
We have to make him understand.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.000
I'll talk to Naruto about everything.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.470
You, Sakura?

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.700
Do you have a plan that'll work?

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.500
Just leave everything to me.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.270
So don't say anything to Naruto.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.200
Please promise me this, everyone.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.570
And…

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.530
Damn it… Is this what she had in mind?

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.000
Sakura, did something happen?

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.700
This is all so sudden.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.670
Nothing happened!

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.300
It’s obvious why I fell in love with you.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.870
All I really want, is for you to accept me, Sasuke.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.230
That’s all… I’m desperate.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.530
Sasuke! Sasuke! Sasuke!

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:54.030
Naruto, this is a once in a lifetime request.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.500
Please, bring Sasuke back!

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.700
Next time I'm coming with you.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.030
Sasuke…

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.770
Sakura…you…

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.600
Sasuke keeps getting farther and farther away from me.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.200
But Naruto, you've always stuck by my side

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.230
and cheered me up.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.700
Naruto, I finally realized…

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.470
your true self.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.170
Even that time with Pain…

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.000
You returned when you were needed most.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.400
The hero who protected the village.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.200
Today, everyone in the village admires you.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.870
And I'm simply one of them now.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.670
You used to be a prank-loving loser.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.000
But now you’ve become a wonderful person.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.770
And I’ve witnessed it all, first-hand.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.030
Meanwhile, Sasuke keeps adding to his crimes,

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.700
and breaking my heart.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.830
Always becoming more of a stranger.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.170
But you Naruto, I’m able to be close to you like this.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.900
You comfort me.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.430
I care about you, from the bottom of my heart—

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.270
Cut it out, Sakura.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.930
This joke isn't funny at all!

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.500
Why are you so upset?

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.900
I'm just telling you that I like you now instead of Sasuke.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.170
You know the saying, “women are as fickle as the autumn weather.”

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:14.230
I hate people who lie to themselves!

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.370
I'm lying to myself?

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.700
I'm the one who decides how I feel!

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.530
If you hate me, just come out and say so!

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.330
Don’t just make up a convenient excuse.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.200
But it doesn't make sense!

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.630
You came all the way out here just to tell me that?

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.130
"Just" to tell you?

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.200
"Just"?

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.800
You don’t think it's a big deal for a girl to profess her love?!

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.530
I came “all the way out here”?

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.800
Of course, I’d come all the way out here!

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.370
Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke! That's all you think about!

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.670
Going after Sasuke and putting yourself in danger!

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.400
You’re the Nine-Tails’ Jinchuriki and the Akatsuki are after you!

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.130
Worry about yourself for a change.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.130
I'm saying that it's not necessary to endanger yourself

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.030
just to chase after Sasuke!

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.800
I want you to come back to the village now, that's why I'm here.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.830
That's all!

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.300
I think it just sounds like a painful excuse.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.500
I know you pretty well, Sakura.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.270
Then why don’t you understand?

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.630
I don't care about Sasuke now that he’s a criminal.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.070
So the promise between us doesn't matter anymore.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.530
It’s not just about the promise.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.600
I kind of understand more now,

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.830
about why Sasuke has become obsessed with revenge

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.600
and is causing so much damage.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.870
Sasuke loved his family and his clan.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.800
Because his love was so deep, it’s hard for him to forgive.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.200
If he were so devoted,

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.570
why would he join the Akatsuki after defeating the unforgivable Itachi?

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.070
That’s not how it went down.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.100
What really happened… Naruto!

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.830
For now, we'll keep what Madara said to ourselves…

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.930
in absolute secrecy.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.770
We're in the midst of reconstruction and must avoid unnecessary mayhem.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.300
Furthermore, until we cross check the facts, we can't trust him.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.270
There's too much that we don't know about his claim

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.800
that the higher-ups of the Hidden Leaf used Itachi to slaughter the Uchiha Clan.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.600
Especially you, Naruto. Do you understand?

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.100
It doesn’t matter, even if there’s no promise between us anymore.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.900
I personally want to save Sasuke.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.770
What now, Sakura?

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.200
Maybe you should just tell him the truth.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.000
Oww!

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.900
Forget it! I'm going back.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.000
Let's go, Kiba, Lee, Sai!

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.130
Sakura…

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.930
Let's go.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.970
Naruto…I'm sorry!

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.900
Are you okay with this, Sakura?

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.970
Kiba, I need a favor.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.900
What is it?

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.270
I'm going to start looking for Sasuke right now!

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.670
Will you help me?

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.300
If we just got rid of the Eight-Tails’ and Nine-Tails’ hosts,

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.530
we could stop Madara's plan and

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.270
weaken the military power of the Cloud and the Leaf.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.700
We could kill two bird with one stone!

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.930
It was agreed that this time, we will do no such thing.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.800
Why not?! That’s not like you, Stubborn Geezer!

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.500
Then let me ask you this.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.370
Sure. I will answer anything, kid.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.270
When did you all forsake yourselves?

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.970
It’s because I remembered.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.100
Remembered what?

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.070
I remembered who I was before I became so stubborn!

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:07.700
Ponta…

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.430
He may be big, but he’s not a bear worth shredding!

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.700
Ponta is a raccoon!

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.500
You will feel the passion of my wrath!

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.370
Passion? So you can use it in this sort of situation.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.530
Okay, got it!

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.170
PONTA IS A RACCOON I'd better add that Ponta is a raccoon.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.470
So you mean…

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.670
you're going to get in my way!

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.500
A pencil whose penetrating power has been increased

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.630
by high frequency oscillations generated by the Lightning Style, huh?

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.770
That’s even greater than the Wind Style’s penetration power.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.030
High frequency indeed.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.600
If I had taken a direct hit, it would have left a hole in me.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.330
Yosaku Chop!

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:09.070
He's watching my moves and using Lightning Style enhanced ninja tools

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.800
from mid-range distances.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:19.730
But it's also a diversionary tactic to try to confine me.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.600
Now twice you shall be perfo-rated. Don’t let that make me hated.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.230
What's going on?!

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:39.000
Bee's Super Vibrato Lightning Blade didn’t pierce through?

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.270
Well then…

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.870
Eight-Tails’ Cloak!

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.500
Head butt!

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.630
All right. That guy’s head will roll.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.030
You... My chakra…

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.100
Bee! I saw it!

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:07.370
It's that sword! It’s sucking away your chakra!

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.300
It probably absorbed the chakra out of your Super Vibrato Lightning Blade

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.430
before it even made contact!

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.530
That's why it didn't pierce through.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.800
Your octopus-flavored chakra must be very appealing.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.200
It's rare that Samehada gets this worked up.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.670
You are worthy of shredding.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.670
Your eyes are cute, it’s so surprising.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.300
But making them into dead fish eyes… is what I’m devising.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.370
You… Umm…

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:59.730
Kisame Hoshigaki, pleased to meet you after the fact.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.200
A Tailed Beast Cloak with only seven chakra tails…

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.130
Does this mean you’re going to get serious?

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.430
I’m gonna make you weep! You sharky creep!

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.770
Ink in your mouth…

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.400
The rumors are true. You really are an octopus brat.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.170
Did you know? Octopi eat sharks.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:00.130
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: The Tailed Beast vs. The Tailless Tailed Beast

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.370
This time, the shark shall devour the octopus.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.770
Tune in again!
