00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.300
Kabuto, I'll tell you about this kid later...

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.270
More importantly...

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.900
Why don't you call over the three little mice behind you?

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.530
So he's seen through everything, huh...?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.370
There's the signal!

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.930
You again, huh...?

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.570
I've seen that face often...

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.500
And it looks like the Nine-Tails kid is here, too...

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.330
Maybe I'll play with you guys a little.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.430
Let's see who's become stronger... you or Sasuke.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.400
Give Sasuke...

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.170
back...!

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.630
"Give him back" is not the correct way of saying it, Naruto...

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.200
Your reasoning is off...

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.800
Sasuke came to us because he wanted to.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700
For a man, you're too obsessed... about the past.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.400
You need to resign yourself.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.000
Shut up, four-eyes!

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.200
You don't even know how Naruto feels...

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.230
Stop acting so cold about everything!

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.230
If you want to know about Sasuke,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.130
try forcing it out of me...

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.530
If you can, that is...

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.630
The Nine-Tails Unleashed 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.530
Naruto... What is this?!

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.170
What is that?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.730
I see...

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.100
So it appeared just as I thought...

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.900
Judging from the shape of the Chakra,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.700
the number of tails will probably continue to grow...and eventually...

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.530
there will be nine.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.730
That's about the size of it...

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.500
Master Jiraiya, how many tails have you seen?

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.830
I've come close... to dying twice...

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.730
The first time, I broke six ribs and both arms,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.900
and several of my internal organs ruptured...

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.430
It was when I tried to peek into the women's bath at a hot spring

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.770
and you pounded me good, Tsunade...

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.600
The other time was...

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.730
during Naruto's training

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.930
when I saw the fourth tail of the Nine-Tails Chakra.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.900
His anger became the trigger

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.200
and the number of Fox Spirit tails he grew increased.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.970
He maintained consciousness up until the third Fox Spirit tail.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.300
But by the fourth tail,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.730
he had lost all rationality and was controlled by destructive impulses.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.300
He was just like a small version of the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.370
Even with the Fourth Hokage's seal

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.370
it can go that far?

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.670
Yes.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.400
I don't know the details, but I can say this for certain:

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.070
The Fourth Hokage's Sealing Jutsu might very well...

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.300
be weakening.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.700
The Fourth Hokage's Sealing Jutsu...?

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.470
I can't believe it...

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.000
There's more...

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.700
It may appear that when Naruto is in the Nine-Tails state,

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.070
he's being protected by the Nine-Tail's Cloak...

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.430
But in actuality, his body was continuing to suffer damage

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.770
from the Nine Tail's Cloak itself.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.230
After the fourth tail formed,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.830
his body, wrapped in the Nine-Tail's Cloak, grew bloodied,

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.730
and he thrashed about despite suffering serious injuries.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.530
After the Nine-Tail's Cloak dissipated,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.170
his wounded body

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.100
was healed by the Nine-Tails Chakra inside his body.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.300
But if he continues to get hurt

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.830
and then heal at that speed over and over...

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.730
Naruto's body will break down and his life span will shorten.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.800
That's why we need you... Yamato!

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.730
You, who has inherited the cells of the First Hokage.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.570
Now you're the only one...

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.230
who can control the Jinchuriki Host.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.530
Fortunately for us,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.330
Naruto happens to be wearing the First Hokage's necklace...

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.900
We're counting on you...

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.300
Naruto... you've grown considerably as a Jinchuriki Host.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.330
The power of the Nine-Tails is rapidly getting stronger...

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.570
The striking feature of the "Jinchuriki Host" is

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.970
how it utilizes unbelievable power by resonating with the "Tailed Beast."

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.970
Naruto...

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.800
You're starting to become more like a Jinchuriki Host, aren't you...

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.870
Naruto?

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.830
I get it...

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.370
So that's why you were chosen to keep watch over him, huh?

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.670
So my experiment turned out to be somewhat useful...

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.870
Experiment...?

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.430
The Leaf should be thanking me a little more for this...

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:50.970
Don't you agree...

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.700
my adorable little test subject...?

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:57.400
Test subject?

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.570
Who the heck is this person?

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.430
It happened...

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.130
a long time ago when I was still in the Hidden Leaf Village...

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.570
I wanted the power of the First Hokage,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.070
the only one among all Shinobi who could use the Wood Style Ninjutsu

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.030
and control Tailed Beasts at will.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.070
I once conducted an experiment where I took some DNA information...

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.430
from the remains of the First Hokage and implanted genetic components...

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:38.070
from that DNA into the cells of sixty children.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.470
But their bodies violently rejected it,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.730
and they died while kicking and struggling...

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.230
Around the time when I was about to give up,

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.000
I ended up being tracked by another one of my experiments

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.670
and had to leave the village...

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.870
leaving my laboratory just as it was.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.770
I thought all the test subjects had died...

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.170
but I never thought one of them would still be alive.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.570
I get it...

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.130
Four-Pillar Prison Jutsu!

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:30.100
Th-This is...the secret Jutsu that only the First Hokage could use.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.100
The Wood Style Ninjutsu!

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.170
How come Captain Yamato can use the Wood Style Ninjutsu?

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.730
So that's why he can use the Wood Style

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.870
that only the First Hokage could use...

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.670
So that's the story...

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.170
I see...

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.730
So it looks like we'll now be able to obtain

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.630
a sample from a product of old research.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.570
More important than that...

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:02.500
I'd like to test out how strong my Sasuke has become...

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.730
by having him fight against Naruto.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.730
He doesn't...

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.670
He doesn't belong to you...!

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.930
Don't talk about Sasuke...

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.630
in front of me...

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.700
like he belongs to you!

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:20.730
That's...

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.200
What's...that Chakra?!

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.100
The air stings...

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.100
Interesting...

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800
No doubt about it.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.330
It's the Nine-Tail's Cloak... Three tails have formed...

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.800
Th-That's...the power of the Jinchuriki Host...

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.870
I can feel it in my bones... This...

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.830
This terrifying Chakra...

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.170
is not the kind that can be controlled!

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.530
This is...Naruto Uzumaki's...

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.930
the Nine-Tail's power, huh?

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.430
What power!

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.830
To think there'd be that much power just with Chakra...

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.630
And on top of that, he rampages letting his emotions take over.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.030
It's as if he's not seeing what's around him.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.900
That power of his is a problem,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.530
but this difficult situation is a great opportunity for me.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.000
Failure will not be tolerated.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:03.200
My true mission assigned to me by my Lord Danzo is about to begin.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.530
Next episode: "The Top-Secret Mission Begins"
