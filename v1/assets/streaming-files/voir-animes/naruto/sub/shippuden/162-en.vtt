WEBVTT

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.540
He's born!

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.460
The Fourth Hokage's Death Match!

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.750
I'm a father today!

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.250
He's a healthy babe.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.830
Naruto!

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.460
Don't touch him!

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.540
The mother sees him first.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.080
Naruto…

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.210
I finally get to see you.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.130
You'll have lots more time later.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.420
There, there.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.000
How are you feeling, Kushina?

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.170
Okay.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.420
Thank you.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.380
Minato…

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.290
All right!

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.920
I know you've gone through childbirth,

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.000
but I'm going to completely seal the Nine Tails!

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.330
Lady Biwako!

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.460
Taji!

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.670
Fourth Hokage Minato, get away from the Jinchuriki.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.920
Otherwise, this child's life will end in one minute.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.460
How did he get past the barrier?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.290
This guy…

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.960
Who the hell is he?

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.920
Kushina!

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.500
The Nine Tails Seal is still…

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.040
Get away from the Jinchuriki.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.420
Don't you care what happens to your kid?

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.380
Wait! Calm down!

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.880
Speak for yourself, Minato.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.670
I'm as cool as can be.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.290
Naruto!

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.000
Well, I must hand it to the Yellow Flash.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.670
But I wonder about this next one.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.710
Minato!

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.880
Naruto!

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
Thank goodness… Naruto isn't hurt.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.380
I was forced to use the Flying Raijin Jutsu.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.880
His target is Kushina…

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.630
and he succeeded in separating us.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.040
I must hurry.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.670
Just what…do you want?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.290
I'm going to pull the Nine Tails out from you

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.580
and destroy the Hidden Leaf.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.710
What?

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.670
Minato's Teleportation Jutsu allows him to move instantly

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.710
between locations marked with Jutsu Formulas.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.540
He made sure to mark your Sealing Formula with it too…

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.420
in order to protect you.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.880
However, I managed to put a distance between you.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.580
Furthermore, the Nine Tails' Seal has been weakened from childbirth.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.880
Do you know how long I've waited for this moment?

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.000
You'll be safe here.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.710
Naruto, just wait awhile.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.750
I have to go and save your mother.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.540
You are…

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.580
Now then, come out Nine Tails!

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:15.830
Good.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.330
Now I'll go straight to Hidden Leaf Village.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.540
Hold it.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.500
Uzumaki Shinobi are amazing.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.750
You don't die right away after the Tailed Beast is extracted.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.540
You were the Jinchuriki of the Nine Tails.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.580
I'll use him to kill you.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.330
I must say, you're as quick as your nickname.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.420
But you are too late.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.040
Minato…

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.080
Is Naruto…Is he safe?

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.580
Yes, he's fine.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.670
He's in a safe place for now.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.630
Thank goodness.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.830
Minato, you must stop that man and the Nine Tails right now.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.630
He's heading for Hidden Leaf Village.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.420
He flew off again.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.540
Well, never mind.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.170
We're heading for the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.290
Why?

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.830
Never mind that.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.290
Just stay with Naruto.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.540
Naruto…

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.080
Minato… Thank you.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.670
Good luck.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.460
FOURTH HOKAGE FOURTH HOKAGE I'll be right back.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.000
Oh, another falling star!

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.420
Did you make a wish this time?

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.330
Oh, I forgot.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.540
What do you mean you're going out now?

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.710
Well, the guys are getting together.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.630
I have to go out sometimes!

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.250
"Sometimes"? It's been every night lately!

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.460
I'll be sure to come home early.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.420
Thank you!

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.830
Thanks, I'll come again.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.500
Hey! Watch where you're walking.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.380
Why don't we just do Rock-Paper-Scissors again tonight?

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.670
Not that again! Think of something more exciting!

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.710
How can you call yourself my rival?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.630
We have an early start tomorrow. So let's pass for tonight.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.710
Don't use a mission as an excuse!

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.960
I have all this pent-up energy inside me!

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.170
Now is the time for diligent training!

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.040
Honest-to-goodness discipline and hard work

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.460
lead to success in future missions!

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.580
Are you listening to me?!

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.040
Say Guy…

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.670
Do you sense anything weird?

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.210
There's been a chill in the air.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.630
It's your attitude that's causing it!

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.670
We're only young once!

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.710
What is this feeling?

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.750
There, there…

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.080
It's a strange feeling.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.000
Of all times for Mom and Dad to be out.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.250
Don't cry, Sasuke.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.250
No matter what happens,

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.540
your big brother will definitely protect you.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.540
It can't be…

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.380
Summoning Jutsu!

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.710
– What happened? – Is it an accident?

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.920
That's…!

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.130
N-No way…!

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.580
The Nine Tails!

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.080
– Run! – It's the Nine Tails!

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.500
– Help! – We're done for!

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.460
Go, Nine Tails!

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.630
Lord Third Hokage!

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.290
The Nine Tails is…!

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.080
The Nine Tails has suddenly appeared in the village!

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.500
I'm aware of that. I will suppress it.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.630
You and the others protect the civilians!

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.710
Yes sir!

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.330
Was Kushina's seal broken?

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.710
Despite all the precautions, did we fail?

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.040
Biwako…

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.920
Damn you, Nine Tails!

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.790
This is the moment I release my pent-up power!

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.170
Don't be hasty, Guy!

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.330
Come on! I'll be your opponent!

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.670
– Wait! – Huh?

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.540
Gather immediately in the guardroom!

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.750
Why?

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.170
It's the Third Hokage's orders!

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.790
Lord Hiruzen?

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.250
You heard. Let's go, Guy!

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.860
Now's our chance! Evacuate the civilians!

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:37.960
Are we ready?

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.080
Yes!

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.790
Over here, Nine Tails!

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.330
Over here, Nine Tails!

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.080
Where are you looking?!

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.670
Over here.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.170
Do not falter!

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.670
Even if we can't defeat the Nine Tails,

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.420
we must concentrate on evacuating the villagers!

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.580
Do not take action on your own!

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.790
Assemble before Lord Hiruzen!

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.540
Carry out the orders!

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.290
As Hokage,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.250
I will protect the village, my family, right now.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.630
This is what I need to do.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.210
I won't allow it to do as it pleases anymore!

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.210
So you've taken notice of me.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.080
You won't get your way here!

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.750
For this large a scale,

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.420
I'll have to be careful where I send it.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.500
The jutsu that stopped the Nine Tails' attack

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.290
must be the Teleportation Barrier!

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.580
It's Minato?

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.210
All right! We're going too!

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:32.830
Right!

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.670
I must report all that's happened to Lord Third immediately.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.500
I'm your opponent… and it's all over.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.380
He flew away. He's fast.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.250
Next time, I'll get him faster.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.330
The instant we make contact.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.750
My attack missed.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.290
But he materialized and instantly tried to drag me in.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
What is that jutsu?

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.710
I won't let you get away.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.250
He uses the Teleportation Jutsu too?

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.670
Is that how he took Kushina and moved away so quickly?

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.580
A shinobi who outmaneuvered the Anbu assigned under Lord Third's direct control…

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.250
who slipped through a top-secret barrier…

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.540
and who knew that the Nine Tails' Seal

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.790
would weaken during childbirth.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.580
Furthermore, he undid the Nine Tails' Seal,

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.710
tamed it and…

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.670
went in and out of the barrier

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.750
set up by the Hidden Leaf without being caught.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.670
I know of only one shinobi capable of this.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.460
Are you Madara Uchiha?

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.330
No, that's impossible.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.460
He's dead.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.580
I wonder about that.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.710
At this point, it doesn't matter who you are.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.670
But why are you targeting the Hidden Leaf?

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:39.540
I could say I did it on a whim, or that I planned it,

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.670
or that it's war,

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.170
or that it's for peace.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.130
Whatever the case, he's no ordinary man!

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.420
He can control the Nine Tails and his Teleportation Jutsu surpasses

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.170
both Lord Second's and mine.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.670
And he has some dangerous ideology.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.710
I must deal with him now

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.500
or he'll be even more trouble than the Nine Tails!

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.500
If I transport myself to the village now,

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.540
he will follow and the battlefield will become even more chaotic.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.500
If he's anything like Madara,

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.290
I can't keep the Nine Tails under the Summoning Jutsu for too long.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.540
I just have to entrust the village to Lord Third.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.460
As for me… I must take this guy down right here!

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.460
Now that I have freed the Nine Tails,

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.710
you people have no hope left!

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.670
His flesh…

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.540
My physical attacks have no effect on him,

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.540
but he makes himself materialize to attack me.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.210
Namely, I can only aim for him when we both strike blows!

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.540
But his risk lies during the moment of attack.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.130
And considering the time remaining on the Nine Tails' Summoning Jutsu,

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.000
he doesn't relish a long battle either.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.880
The one who attacks an instant quicker than the other…

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.460
will win this match!

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.540
I win.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.630
Damn it! He flew to that kunai from earlier!

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.580
That was my Flying Raijin, Level 2.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:32.580
You got me.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.000
This is what is meant by "elusive."

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.540
I should never have let down my guard.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.500
Flying Raijin Jutsu!

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.040
So that's it… He marked my body somewhere!

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.750
A Contract Seal?

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.750
He intends to separate the Nine Tails from me?

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.790
With this, the Nine Tails no longer belongs to you!

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.710
Naruto, our newborn son!

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.880
I wish I could've been with you.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.130
But our family is shinobi.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.290
We must sacrifice our lives to protect what we believe in!

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.750
Don't forget us Naruto. We love you forever.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.750
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Thank You"

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.790
I'm going to seal the Nine Tails in Naruto!

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.380
Tune in again!
