WEBVTT

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.850
A Place to Return to

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.720
Oww!

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880
Try to bear with it.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.820
This should ease the pain a bit.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.520
Thank you, Sakura...

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.820
The wound is deep. I'll do what I can here...

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.920
Sakura...

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.080
How is Yuukimaru doing?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.780
Shizune Senpai and the others are tending to him now.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.350
This is terrible. His Chakra Network is...

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.650
Yes, he's suffered a lot of damage...

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.320
Even with treatment,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.550
it'd be impossible to restore him to normal completely.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.320
It seems the power to control the Three-Tails took quite a toll

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.720
on Yuukimaru's body.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.780
The Jutsu reduced his life...?

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.720
Yes.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.380
I can't be certain until we conduct a thorough examination,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.920
but it's likely that Yuukimaru no longer has the powers he once had.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.820
We've now lost our only chance of controlling the Three-Tails...

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.150
Perhaps, for this child, it's better that way...

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.780
Shizune, how is Yuukimaru?

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.780
He'll live. He's still asleep...

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.180
Thank goodness he made it.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.550
Yeah...

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.550
But...

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.320
I wasn't able to help him at all in the end... What?

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.150
I foolishly told him "wherever someone thinks about you is the place to return to..."

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.120
But right before his eyes, he lost that very place to return to.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.350
That wasn't your fault.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.320
But still...

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.520
You are the one I should return to, after all...

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.420
And I'm the one you should return to, Guren.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.250
I promise you... I will never leave your side.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.520
I will always think of you.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.080
Uh-huh... And I will always think of you, Guren.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.580
From now, and forever...

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.880
Naruto...

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.120
I'm sorry. Yuukimaru...

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.550
And that is the situation, Lady Tsunade.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.950
I see... I understand.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.150
Katsuyu, order everyone to return.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.720
Are you sure?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.180
We have no choice.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.650
It would be impossible to have them continue their mission.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.780
Now that the child has lost his powers,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.680
Orochimaru can no longer do anything to the Tailed Beast.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.050
We'll pull back for now, regroup, and come up with a new plan.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.920
But Orochimaru is not the only one who is after the Three-Tails...

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.220
I'm perfectly aware of that.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.120
But the Three-Tails is an adversary that has given us

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.520
a great deal of trouble up to this point.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.150
Even the Akatsuki won't have an easy time.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.720
I'll send Ninja to replace them immediately.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.880
Once they arrive, have them tell everyone to withdraw!

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.820
Right away.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.620
Those are Lady Tsunade's orders.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.250
Understood.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.480
We'll inform everyone immediately.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.320
We have new orders from Lady Hokage.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.250
We will abort our current mission.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.480
Our orders are to return to the village immediately.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.450
- What? - Huh?!

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.250
That was sudden.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.180
Hey c'mon, is it okay to leave the Three-Tails?

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.080
We won't have to worry about that.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.980
They're sending Ninja to replace us and maintain the watch.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.850
But still...!

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.450
There's nothing we can do even if we remain here.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.880
Everyone has suffered too many wounds.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.480
Lady Tsunade has decided that it would be more effective

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.380
if we brought back the information we've gained this time around

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.250
and apply it to our next plan instead.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.250
We'll move out tomorrow morning.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.450
I want you all to get a good night's rest before we move out.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.080
Guren...

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.520
Guren...

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.220
Gozu?

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:26.880
Why're you...

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.750
Why're you saving me...?

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.820
Do you remember...that day?

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.180
I was placed in solitary after losing control during Orochimaru's experiment...

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.680
I was hardly given any water or food to speak of.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.150
I was on the verge of dying from thirst.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.050
Then you came and kindly gave me a ladleful of water.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.150
Because of that, I was able to survive.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.980
Ever since that day, I...

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.150
I don't even remember. I must've been feeling generous.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:11.350
Even if that were so, I've always admired you since then...

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.320
Guren...

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.150
O-Ow...

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.120
Huh?!

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.150
Yuukimaru?!

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.320
Damn!

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.350
Senpai.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.820
Damn! Where could he have gone?!

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.520
His body's...

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.980
in no condition to...!

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.750
Yuukimaru...

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:16.950
Damn!

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:18.750
A grass whistle?

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.480
Could it be Yuukimaru?!

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.680
Come back! Yuukimaru--!

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.570
Yuukimaru! Where are you, Yuukimaru?!

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.800
Damn! It's my fault...!

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.770
Yuukimaru...

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.570
This is...!

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.600
Why would he leave behind something as important as...?

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.700
There isn't even a single crack...

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.000
I see. So that's it...

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.170
Yuukimaru disappeared?

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.000
How could he even move in his condition?

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.500
Hey, Naruto. You were in the room with him.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:48.670
Didn't you notice?

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.530
No, I guess not.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.770
Huh?! How can you call yourself a Ninja?!

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.870
Just what you'd expect from a Genin!

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.770
Shut up! You were asleep, too, you know!

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.670
Why you...!

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.100
Don't put me in the same league as a stamina freak like you!

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.330
Arguing won't do any good!

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.030
But I'm worried about Yuukimaru.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.170
He has nowhere to go, and...

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.570
We can't just ignore him! Let's all look for him!

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.530
I agree!

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.000
That won't be necessary.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:16.930
The reason is...

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.230
because a child who lost his power to control the Three-Tails

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.030
is no longer a threat to us.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.770
That's not the issue here!

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.970
No, Shino is right.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.830
We're under no obligation to look for a child who ran away.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.970
And besides, we've been ordered to return.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.200
But that's...!

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.100
Are you okay with that, Naruto?!

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.700
Yeah, there's nothing to worry about.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.430
He can handle himself.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.030
Naruto...?

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.370
We'd better be on our way.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.700
Sorry to keep you all waiting, Kakashi.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.700
I was hoping we could have shaken up the Akatsuki...

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.700
I'm sorry. I didn't count on the Leaf Ninja interfering.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.970
And so, did that woman...

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.330
Guren die?

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.700
Regretfully, yes.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.030
She possessed very interesting powers...

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.970
Like you mean that...

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.100
Maybe you were the one who killed her?

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.930
Heaven forbid.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.970
Well, never mind.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.870
We can find any number of replacements for someone of her ability.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.570
But Yuukimaru...

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.500
Leave it.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.400
At this point...

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.270
Lord Orochimaru!

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.270
I'll bring your medicine right away!

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.530
That host body has reached its limit...

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.000
At this point, it has lost all meaning...

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.800
Because soon, I will possess his body...

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.300
What's the matter, Naruto?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.100
No, it's nothing...

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.530
Is that the regular report?

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.430
Yeah...

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.800
A fog is forming.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.770
According to the unit we're taking over for,

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.070
it's apparently created by the Three-Tails.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.630
It induces hallucinations, so be careful.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.130
That's news to me, hmm...

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.970
You! That costume...

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:05.570
Dam--!

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.800
Humph... Oh wow! Deidara Senpai, that was awesome!

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.070
That's the last of the lookouts.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.800
Your info was way off.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.900
"A force separate from the Leaf Ninja was engaged

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.430
in a vigorous clash over the Three-Tails."

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.600
Wasn't that what you said?

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:36.600
Well, that's how it was supposed to be... That's odd.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.730
But oh well, it's good that we got rid of the ones in our way.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.700
Let's make our quota right now while we have the chance!

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:48.030
You're a hundred years too young to be giving me orders, hmm...

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.130
H-H-Hey, Senpai!

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.530
Weren't you listening to the story about the hallucinations?

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.900
Who do you think you're speaking to?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Don't underestimate my art.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.430
Sheesh, he's got a short temper...

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:14.300
That's a huge lake to find the Three-Tails in.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.470
It'd be faster if it appeared on its own.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:53.030
Oh! On closer inspection, it looks something like a huge turtle.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.400
A powerful one...

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:56.830
So that's the Three-Tails...

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.770
I think I'll leave it for you to handle, Deidara Senpai.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.200
Tobi, you formally became a member of Akatsuki, right?

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.870
You take care of the rest, hmm!

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.600
No way...

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.930
It's coming!

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:27.730
If it's a water creature, shouldn't we have let Kisame handle it?!

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.330
I'd say they assigned the wrong person for the job!

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.500
Pitiful, I'd say.

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:13.630
Now!

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:21.900
Is something the matter?

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.170
No...

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.300
It appears everyone has entered the Land of Fire safely.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.300
I see. Good work.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.730
You may now return, Katsuyu.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:35.600
Yes.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.370
I did it! Banzai! Banzaai!

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.270
Deidara, did you see my Jutsu?! Just one time, and bam!

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.200
You can understand why I was given this important assignment

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.730
right after formally becoming a member of Akatsuki, can't you?!

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.900
No... It was probably my clay bomb doing its artistic work.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.100
You have my artistry to thank, hmm.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.200
Don't get so carried away that you forgot that I lent you a hand!

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:20.230
If you're a member of Akatsuki, don't talk so much and act more cool.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.170
In other words, "cool = art"!

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:32.070
Listen, art is a passionate moment coming from cool emotions--!

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.170
Senpai, you talk a lot.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.830
I was joking...!

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.000
What is it?

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.230
It's just that...

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.070
contact from the unit that headed for the lake is rather late, don't you think?

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.630
Let's file a report, just in case.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.830
Listen, Tobi.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.730
You shouldn't press your luck!

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.600
The Three-Tails was just weak because it didn't have a Jinchuriki host.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.030
It didn't have a mind to control its power.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:19.300
Hey, Tobi.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.500
You don't have to be so cool as to stop talking altogether.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:23.930
At least answer me...

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.270
Hmm?!

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:32.570
Oh that's the spot... Oh my...

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.970
This is the perfect wake up for you, I'd say. You bastard!

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.030
Wow, it feels like I hadn't been back in ages.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.530
We had one mission after another...

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.570
Dinner tonight is at Ichiraku!

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.230
Say, Naruto.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.430
Huh?

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.070
About Yuukimaru... Are you sure it was best that way?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.900
You used to worry so much about him.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.330
That's okay.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.630
Besides, even if we went looking for him, he wouldn't be easy to find anyway.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.470
What do you mean?

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.070
The Pervy Sage's words were true, after all.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.970
He said wherever someone cares about you is the place you return to.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.830
If you believe, and keep thinking, about that person...

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.800
your feelings will surely get across, he said.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.170
What? Is this...what I think it is?

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.030
So...we should keep thinking, too.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:40.200
We need to create a place that Sasuke can return to.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.200
Right.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.300
So that's your move... Just as I expected.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.300
You are weaker than me...

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.730
There's no longer any need for me to give you my body.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.470
You Uchiha fledgling...!

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.630
If I hadn't been a fledgling, you'd have had no chance at me, right?

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.800
Silence!

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.400
I don't like the way you do things.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.970
You continue to toy with others for your own pathetic reasons...

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.600
You make me sick!

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.070
Next time: "The Serpent's Pupil"

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.000
Tune in again!
