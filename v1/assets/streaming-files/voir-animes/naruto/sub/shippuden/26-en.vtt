WEBVTT

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.430
I can't carelessly approach him like this.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.300
What intense heat and flames.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.400
One and a half minutes left.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.030
Yes.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.930
Die, Grandma!

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.100
Eat this!

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.800
You wish!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.100
Just as I thought.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.030
You attached a Chakra thread in the middle of that fight, huh?

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.630
But the same trick won't work twice!

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.800
How unfortunate.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.300
There's no time...

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.270
Puppet Fight: 10 vs. 100! 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.430
What's the matter...? Aren't you going to attack?

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.230
The effects of the antidote will last one more minute...

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.630
Then...

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.930
Water?

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.700
Sakura! Get away!

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.630
There!

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.600
How long do you intend to run about?

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.430
Twenty seconds left.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.670
If that's how it's going to be...

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.330
Fifteen seconds...left...

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.330
Are you okay, Sakura?!

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.670
Die!

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.300
Granny Chiyo!

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.670
The antidote is working!

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.830
If I can just endure the pain...

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.970
Your efforts are futile.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.930
Five seconds left!

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.500
Four seconds.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.300
You little--!

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.070
Sakura?!

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.500
Cha!

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.200
Three seconds.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.370
Two!

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.070
Scorpion

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.330
We were able to beat him

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.130
exactly within the sustained duration of the antidote...

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.800
We did it.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.870
Granny Chiyo, we did it!

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.030
Sakura...

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.970
You...

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.000
That kid...has totally calmed down...

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.030
What's he planning?

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.370
Kakashi Sensei! Aren't you ready yet?!

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.270
Hold your horses...

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.870
I don't have as much Chakra as you, after all...

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.930
It's going to take time.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.800
Scorpion

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.130
What did you do?

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.030
That's right.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.270
The fight is just beginning.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.530
This is a Jutsu I myself sealed...

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.070
I didn't think I'd ever use it again...

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.270
But it seems it won't work out that way.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.630
Now let's put an end to this.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.770
It's said the ability of a puppet master is measured

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.500
by the number of puppets they can use...

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.770
I'd expect no less from you, Grandma.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.230
Th-There's so many...

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.200
Ten of them.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.100
Granny Chiyo's secret "Number of Fingers."

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.730
I'd heard rumors about it...

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.070
The device you used to bring down a castle by yourself...

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.800
The Secret White Move: Chikamatsu's 10 Puppets.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.070
The ten masterpieces by Monzaemon,

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.600
the first Puppeteer of the Puppet Master Jutsu...

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.830
It's a great collection of puppets.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.130
However...

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.970
I...

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.570
used this to bring down a nation!

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.600
He's become...this powerful...

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.970
I'm appalled at myself.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.530
How long am I going to have to fight a little girl and an old bag...?

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.700
I never thought I'd have to bring out my final device...

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.730
Secret Red Move: Performance of a Hundred Puppets...

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.870
I'll show you...

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.330
Sakura...

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.200
The effects of your antidote have worn off.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:58.600
Stay out of this.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.900
You should already know...

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.970
my personality!

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:21.800
That's right...

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.300
You've inherited Tsunade's personality as well.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.430
But let's make this the final act.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.630
Are you ready?

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.700
Yes!

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.370
Here he comes!

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.130
Three Treasures Suction Crush!

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.730
With this many of them...

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.330
The surefire way to lessen the number

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.730
is to fight them one-on-one somehow...

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.270
All right!

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.970
There are too many of them!

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.370
Are you okay, Sakura?!

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.630
I'm okay!

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.430
Stay sharp!

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:30.070
Right!

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.530
There definitely aren't as many of Sasori's puppets now...

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.470
But conversely,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.070
it looks like he's concentrating more on each puppet now.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.570
And on top of that, we only have one antidote left.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.430
Things will get tough in a hurry if either Sakura or I get wounded.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.100
Granny Chiyo!

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.570
Oh no...!

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.570
Are you okay, Granny Chiyo?

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.400
You don't need to worry about me!

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.530
More importantly, aim for Sasori.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.530
I'll keep the other puppets in check!

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.300
Right!

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.530
Sakura, use that!

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.200
Here!

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.430
We did it!

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.100
You can't move.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.400
That seal completely suppresses all Chakra.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.330
You can't use your Chakra threads anymore.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.970
It's over, Sasori...

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.730
Granny Chiyo!

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:02.330
Use the antidote quickly!

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.530
She was quick-witted from the very beginning...

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.530
And she was super cute...

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.930
She was way too beautiful! She was my youth!

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.000
Despite her character, she had her good points...

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:48.830
You're right...

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.730
To think she'd pass away so soon like this...

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.570
Lee, cry into my arms!

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.100
Guy Sensei!

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.300
Please watch over us...

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.800
I'll never forget about you, Sakura--!

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.000
Cut it out, all of you! This is discouraging!

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.000
Next time: "Impossible Dream"
