WEBVTT

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.930
Ichiraku Ramen Yeah. Ichiraku hasn't changed a bit!

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.900
Mm... This aroma... It's whetting my appetite.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.370
All right!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.070
Hiya!

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.800
Welcome!

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.730
Old man... Do you remember me?

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.230
Naruto... It's you, isn't it, Naruto?!

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.970
No way could I forget you!

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.230
Long time no see!

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.670
Huh? Naruto?

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.200
You sure got big!

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.030
Long time no see, miss!

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.500
What'll you have? You're hungry, right?

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.830
Yeah, I'm starved!

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.770
All right then, today it's on me.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.430
Order whatever you like!

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.630
All right!

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.570
No...

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.300
It's on me today.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.600
I knew you'd be here, Naruto!

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.000
Iruka Sensei!

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.130
Sakura isn't with you?

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.430
If I'd known you were going to treat, I'd have brought Sakura, too...

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.030
Maybe I should've let him treat me to half a ramen.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.230
Can I get some more rice-flour anmitsu?!

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.930
Oh!

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.800
Wh-What's this?

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.130
It's Lord Kazekage's sand...!

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.170
Wow! Look at the size of the shield he made!

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.070
Just what I'd expect from the Kazekage.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.770
Gaara...

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.100
Okay, you're within...

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.370
range!

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.200
Gaara!

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.300
Mission Cleared 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.330
Okay, you're within...

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.500
range!

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.670
Gaara!

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.200
Fifth Kazekage!

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.330
I wonder if he's okay...

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.200
He did it! You're amazing, Lord Kazekage.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.270
Ooh!

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.170
Gaara's Total Sand Defense can't be broken that easily.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.270
Lord Baki! The preparations for attack have been completed!

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.470
All right! Attack all together when I give the signal!

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.300
I'd expect no less...

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.200
His specially-created sand sure got some quick defense...

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.470
However...

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.830
That's just what I want.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.430
My left hand was crushed...

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.330
Sand Coffin.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.030
However, I used that opportunity to eat some of your sand...

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.130
and mix it with my bomb clay.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.500
You were doomed the instant you used that sand to defend yourself.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.070
That being said, I planned it that way!

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.400
Art...

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.830
- Oh, no... - ...is explosive!

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.200
Here's an extra-large special serving of our ramen!

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.500
It's the real-deal Ichiraku ramen...

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.270
I dreamed about this ramen so many times during my training...

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.670
Now, eat up before it gets cold!

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.670
Right.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.370
Thank you!

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.400
By the way, can I ask you a favor, Sensei?

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.270
You want seconds?

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.300
Let me wear your Leaf Headband.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.600
Oh, this?! No way.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.930
This is proof that you've graduated from the Academy

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.800
and have been acknowledged as a full-fledged Ninja, you see!

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.070
Wait for yours until tomorrow!

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.770
You cheapskate!

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.800
- Naruto... - Huh?

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.400
You've sure grown a lot compared to the time

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.630
when you wanted this...

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.770
Have I?! Have I?! Do you think so?

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.770
This Headband you gave me,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.330
it looks perfect on me now, doesn't it?

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.100
Don't be getting carried away! You've still got a long way to go.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.470
You've still got to do better and better!

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.130
You've gotten so big...

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.500
Man, this is good!

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.370
Sure enough, Ichiraku Ramen is the greatest!

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.900
Isn't it, though?

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.500
But... Hm?!

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.270
There's one thing I'm not quite happy with.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.800
Naruto... We meet for the first time in ages

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.470
and the first thing you do is find fault with my ramen?! Huh?!

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.670
It's... It's not like that.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.930
I don't have a problem with the ramen.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.900
Then what is it?!

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.900
I...thought the next time Iruka Sensei would treat me to ramen

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.330
would be after I'd become a Chunin...

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.170
Naruto...

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.330
All of my classmates have become Chunin,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.670
and I'm the only one who's still just a Genin.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.900
You don't need to worry about whether you're a Genin or a Chunin.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.230
After all, Master Jiraiya trained you personally...

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.970
I know, but...

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.170
But listen, that Pervy Sage is really merciless!

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:14.930
The cloth on the precious Headband you gave me got all tattered.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.000
The same with my clothes, too.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.800
So I got this cloth newly made along with my new threads!

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.100
But thanks to that intense training, you've gotten quite strong, haven't you?

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.170
You should be happy about it.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.370
Yeah. I feel like I've gotten another step closer

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.570
to becoming the Hokage!

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.670
Ooh, sounds like you've got quite the confidence!

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.600
Yeah! Speaking of which,

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.970
I heard Gaara of the Hidden Sand has already become the Kazekage!

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.600
Oh... That kid's kind of special, so.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.470
What do you mean by special?

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.030
Huh?!

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.070
You don't become the Kazekage just by being special.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.770
I can tell...

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.900
I bet...he worked incredibly hard...

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.000
He worked really hard, everyone acknowledged him...

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.330
and then he became the Kazekage!

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.870
What the hell happened...?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.970
G-Gaara...

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.100
Gaara!

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.770
Lady Tsunade.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.900
Have you decided on the first mission for Team Kakashi?

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.500
Naruto and Sakura did nothing but training

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.600
for two and a half years, after all.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.330
I'm going to have them work off those two and a half years!

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.700
Oh, how about something like this...?

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.370
A VIP escort in the Land of Rice Paddies...

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.270
This is a B-rank mission, huh...?

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.100
But Naruto hasn't been on a mission in quite awhile.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.370
Wouldn't an easier mission be better to start...?

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.300
Look, how about something like this...?

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.270
Dog-walking...?

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.070
This is a D-rank mission!

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.870
Sakura's a Chunin,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.500
and I'm sure Naruto is much stronger now.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.600
I can't send them on a mission like this !

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.930
However... there's the issue with the Nine-Tails to consider.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.800
I don't think it's wise to imprudently send him out of the village too much...

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.270
That's why I teamed them up with Kakashi.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.130
I...understand that, but...

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.130
We can at least give them this mission.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.430
I'll concede no further.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.600
A gold bullion transport convoy... A C-rank mission...?

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:57.800
Naruto will probably still get miffed. He'll say it's too easy.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:59.800
Ichiraku Ramen

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.570
Oh!

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.630
Sorry about that, old man!

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.200
Don't worry about it.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.900
Man, what a waste.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:25.930
Lord Kazekage!

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.230
It-It can't be! Gaara's Ultimate Defense has been...

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.300
What the hell did he do...?

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.830
I cause an explosion at point-blank range...

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.600
and you're forced to use

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.570
your speedy gourd sand you crushed my hand with to defend yourself...

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.530
However... then I'm down to my last attack...

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.730
I had to create an opening

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:07.330
in order to cause a sure explosion at close range...

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.470
I dropped my "specialty..." on the village for that very purpose.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.270
I guess I'll go retrieve him.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:13.930
I get it.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.330
Wh-What's happening...?

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.300
He's draining his last remaining strength

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.230
in an attempt to move the sand outside the village...

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.170
He wants to make sure the village isn't damaged!

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.500
I'd expect no less from the Kazekage...

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.400
Even when it'd be easier just to drop it on the village.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.170
G-Gaara...

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.530
Hey, what're you guys doing?! We must protect Lord Kazekage!

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.000
Commence attack!

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.570
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.470
Fire!

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.730
Your attacks are futile.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:08.670
Fire!

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.730
Your attacks are futile, I'm telling you!

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.630
They got a bit creative, huh...?

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.730
My man Sasori will be ticked off if I keep him waiting too long.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.630
Is he going to keep me waiting forever?

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.770
Hang in there, Lord Kazekage!

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.530
Gaara! Hang in there just a little longer!

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.530
He did it!

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.170
Now it's your turn to work hard, Naruto.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.370
But my opposition's the Kazekage...

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.400
I'm still just a Genin...

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.870
But your training with Master Jiraiya wasn't for nothing, right?

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:29.270
I heard you and Sakura were able to take the bells away from Kakashi.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.630
It was more of a cinch than I thought!

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.470
I might even be stronger than you, Iruka Sensei!

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.900
What're you talking about?!

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.430
I'm a long way from being outdone!

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.430
We won't know unless we try!

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.000
Oh, come on!

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.200
In any event, starting tomorrow,

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.700
you'll be working as a member of Team Kakashi, right?

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:50.900
Good luck!

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:53.870
Right!

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.870
I'm going to become Hokage in the future, after all...

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.970
No way will I be outdone by the likes of Gaara!

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.530
Gaara!

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.870
Rescue Lord Kazekage!

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.500
It was harder than I thought not to kill him...

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.100
Mission cleared.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.370
Gaara!

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.600
Here is the latest forecast from today's weather report.
