00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.200
Sasuke's Chakra...

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.330
...changed!

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.730
Not another copy of me!

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.300
Sasuke...

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.030
But you're quite a guy to be able to do a Partial Transformation!

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.670
You're good at controlling your Curse Mark!

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.230
He's strong! Haven't seen a copycat this good since Kimimaro.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.300
I have no intention of fighting.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.900
I only wish to talk to you, Jugo.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.170
Talk...?!

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.400
I'm getting you out of here.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.500
Get me out of here?!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.130
Are you crazy?! Without him...

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.270
Without him...

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.300
I can't...leave this place.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.630
Stop!

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.100
Please stop!

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.800
Oh...guys... How have you been?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.430
Kid, where are you going?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.870
If you value your life, don't go beyond this point.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.830
A demon lives there.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.370
A demon?

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.830
He's known as "Bipolar Jugo."

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.700
Look at that.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.800
Because of Jugo, no one lives in that village, to this day.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.300
No one's ever gotten close to him and come back alive.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.670
I don't mean to lecture you. But you should go back.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.370
What? You've followed me?

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.500
But stop where you are. You must not come.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.730
Now, go back to your own home.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.670
Don't come near me! Go away!

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.130
If you come here, I'll kill you!

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.070
I'll kill anyone who comes in here!

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.400
Who is it?

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.830
Go away!

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.800
Go away! I said to go away!

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.200
I'll kill you...

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.600
Kimimaro...

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.500
Formation!

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.130
I'll say it once more. I have no intention of fighting.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.530
I came to get you out of here.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.830
Come with me.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.930
I can't leave here anymore!

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.330
Sasuke!

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.900
Just kill that guy...Sasuke!

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.730
As if I'll let you get away!

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.070
Geez! What is this place?!

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.570
You're mean! You tricked me, didn't you?

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.730
You went and got lost on your own.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.000
I just followed your directions!

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.070
Are you accusing me of tricking you?!

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.900
How would I benefit from tricking you anyway?

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.970
You can be alone with Sasuke.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.400
A-As if I'd want such a thing...!

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.470
Umm... I mean...

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.330
Well, whatever. But what's going on here?

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.700
Jugo went wild...

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.870
So the two of you went to Jugo, after all.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.130
Where's Sasuke?

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.930
He went out with Jugo.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.930
Well, it's Sasuke. He won't get beaten that easily.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.030
I wonder...

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.500
So Jugo has gotten strong...?

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.730
You could say that...

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.470
By the way, you said that he willingly came to Orochimaru, right?

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.330
Yeah...

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.800
Why?

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.700
To reform himself.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.830
Reform himself...?

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.730
It's possible that...for Jugo,

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.100
Orochimaru's hideout was like a sanctuary.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.900
What does Jugo wish to be reformed from?

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.200
It's like an addiction...

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.530
He can't do anything about it on his own.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.830
Huh?

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.870
He wanted to suppress his urge to kill.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.270
Kill!

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.070
You don't understand...!

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.970
I can no longer escape from this place!

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.530
I'll kill you too!

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.530
I see... Your strength is amazing...

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.930
I thought I was a goner.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.730
Wh-Who are you...?

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.930
Kimimaro... I came in search of you.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.930
Would you... like to go to Lord Orochimaru too?

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.670
Orochimaru...?

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.170
There are many people with Lord Orochimaru

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.630
that are just like you and I...

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.530
You're all alone, aren't you?

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.130
If you go to Lord Orochimaru, you won't be alone anymore.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:51.000
I'm not normal. I can't control myself.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.570
There's no telling when I'll start killing the people around me.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.370
I won't get killed.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.700
I'm not that weak.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.100
Aren't you...afraid of me?

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.900
No, I'm not, Jugo.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.230
I will become your cage...

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.130
As long as I'm by your side... your spirit will be free.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.000
I'll beat you to death!

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.670
Huh? Is that...true?

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.100
Yes. I'm going to absorb the enzyme from your body into my own.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.030
Just like you, I will possess the power of the Curse Mark.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.670
Hold on a minute.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.530
The Curse Mark doesn't adapt to just anyone.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.970
If it doesn't adapt...

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.230
I know... At that moment, I'll die.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.630
If you know, then stop this!

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.800
It's part of the treatment.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.400
My body is being eaten away by disease.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.930
Perhaps your Curse Mark will slow its progress.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.270
Your power will save me.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.730
Don't worry so much.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.830
It's all right. We're best friends.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.270
There is no way your power will reject me.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.630
Kimimaro...why did you...

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.830
Why did you...leave me and die!

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.530
What?!

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:57.800
You're using a different technique than before, Jugo. It's solid.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.230
Stop it, Suigetsu.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.030
That's right!

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.270
You're Suigetsu. I remember now.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.730
This guy is dangerous, after all, Sasuke.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.270
Sasuke...?

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.930
We didn't come here to fight.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.670
Let me talk to him.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.930
I doubt that anything you say will get through to him.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.570
You just have to take him by force!

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:26.700
Stop it, both of you!

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.030
Keep going! Just kill each other off!

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.700
Do you both...want me to kill you?

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.770
Just now...that was real bloodthirst.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.900
Y-You're irresistible...Sasuke...

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.170
H-Hurry up and lock me in!

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.370
Jugo... I only came to free you.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.430
Come with me.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.530
He's too scared.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.330
No... That's not it.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.530
I don't want to kill anymore people.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.430
I don't want to go outside... Leave me alone!

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.130
What is this? Talk about split personality...

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:56.870
I told you so... Jugo has this uncontrollable urge to kill.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.130
He's unable to suppress the urge

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.930
even though he really doesn't want to kill people.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.300
I don't know when I'll kill someone again.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.430
So just put the lock on!

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.830
See, this guy is dangerous, Sasuke.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.570
I can't even walk in front of him without getting nervous.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:22.070
What's with you guys?! Just leave me alone!

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.970
Orochimaru is dead.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.000
And this hideout has been destroyed.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.330
If you stay here, you'll die as well.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.230
That's fine with me... I don't want to kill anyone ever again!

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.000
Don't worry... I will become your cage.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.200
I will stop you.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.070
What can you do?

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.100
The only one who can make these urges stop is Kimimaro.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.600
Without Kimimaro, I won't leave!

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.900
Kimimaro? You mean of the Kaguya clan...?

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:13.070
Yeah... Jugo and Kimimaro were especially favored by Orochimaru.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.370
They were kept together in this hideout for human experiments

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.830
for a long time.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.830
Plus, Kimimaro was strong...

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.100
Jugo was valuable for human experiments

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.330
and Kimimaro was the only one able to stop Jugo's rampages without hurting him.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.300
But I thought that guy was already...

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.930
Yeah... Jugo... Kimimaro died for my sake.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.270
He's no longer here.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.000
Died for your sake?!

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.400
Then you're...

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.100
Sasuke Uchiha...?

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:53.530
Yes.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.000
Sasuke...

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.500
Uchiha...

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.670
Why are you being sent out? You're sick!

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.630
This has never happened before... Sasuke Uchiha...

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.570
The man who is taking my place as Lord Orochimaru's vessel...

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.800
It's to bring him in.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.530
Is he worth going that far?

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.470
If you take me out of the running as a vessel,

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.270
then there is no one else.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.170
He is like my reincarnation.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.930
I will risk my life to bring him here.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.870
I'm grateful to you, Jugo.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.570
Your power made me much stronger.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.130
Well Jugo... I'll be back again.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.330
Is that how it is...Kimimaro.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.730
Now... I have all the members I had in mind.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.400
So I will tell you my goal.

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:22.030
My goal is to kill Itachi Uchiha of the Akatsuki.

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.100
Thought so...

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.630
Itachi Uchiha...? But that's his brother!

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.600
And I want to borrow your strength for that.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.930
Naturally, I won't force you.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.700
Karin... You said you had business to take care of.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.130
What will you do?

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:45.930
W-Well... On second thought, it's not that urgent...

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.100
Karin... Be honest with yourself.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.570
Isn't being with Sasuke all you really want?

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.570
Th-That's not true! Whoever said such a thing?

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.600
That's...! I...!!

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.430
See, I hit it right on the mark.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.130
That's why you're speechless. So obvious.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.270
I know all about it...

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.700
Long ago... you had a crush on Sasuke...

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.530
Suigetsu, don't get Karin so worked up...

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.070
I thought I told you to be cooperative.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.170
All right... Sorry, Karin.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.800
But as much as you hate it...

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.030
I'm sticking to Sasuke like glue.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.630
At least until I possess one of the Seven Hidden Mist Blades...

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:38.070
Kisame Hoshigaki's Great Shark Fin sword.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.830
So you're just sword collecting? How lame...

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:48.300
Suigetsu... I know. Jugo, what about you?

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:53.100
Kimimaro used to say that you were his reincarnation, Sasuke...

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.870
And he bet his life to protect you.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.930
So I want to see with my own eyes

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.330
just how great of a Ninja you are.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.670
Then it's all set!

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.700
What's the matter with him?

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.770
Orochimaru is dead, so why isn't he returning to the village?

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.970
Sasuke is possessed by the desire for revenge.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.800
He intends to approach the Akatsuki

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.470
in order to kill his older brother Itachi.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.870
That guy! Is he still...? Dammit!

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.230
From this point on, we move together.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.700
And henceforth, we will call ourselves... Hebi.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.400
Well, let's get going.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.770
Operation "Track Akatsuki" is still ongoing, right?

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:53.070
Yes... If we hunt down that Akatsuki member first

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.970
we'll definitely run into Sasuke eventually!

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.230
Hebi has but one objective...

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.030
In other words, our target is... Itachi... Uchiha!

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.730
I'll tell you a story from when I was still just a kid.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.570
It was during the final days of the Third Great Ninja War.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.970
Due to the long war with other nations,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
the Leaf was suffering from an unprecedented lack of war capability.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.670
It was during such time when that incident occurred.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.600
It was my first mission as a Jonin.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:03.070
Next time: "Kakashi Chronicles~ A Boy's Life on the Battlefield ~ Part 1"

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.000
Lady Katsuyu, may I ask you a question?

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:09.770
Yes?

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.470
How did you get here?

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.630
Oh, that was...

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:18.000
So, please join Sakura as soon as possible.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.000
As soon as possible... Everyone is waiting for you!

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.270
Understood.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:27.670
However, I can't walk that fast... Oh no!!

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.200
This is nothing, they're all waiting...

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.030
Ah, the sunlight... the dryness...

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.600
Oh no! It's a slug monster!

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:37.370
Get me some salt, salt!

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.770
Please wait, I'm not...

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.130
You went through all that trouble for us...?!

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.330
Oh no, my effort was nothing compared to yours.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.000
Not at all! We didn't know any of that...

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.000
Here, Naruto. Come here and apologize to her with me!

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.030
Whoa, for what?

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.530
You too, Sai!!

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.000
Just kidding.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:00.430
Actually Lady Tsunade sent me here using the transportation technique.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.830
Sakura still has a lot to learn.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.370
Tune in again!
