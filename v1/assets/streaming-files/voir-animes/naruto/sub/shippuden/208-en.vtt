WEBVTT

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.110
Stone Golem!

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.280
It will pulverize him!

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.070
Wood Style…

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.570
Deep Forest Bloom!

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.070
Damn you!

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.530
As expected…

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.900
It's coming closer… What should we do?!

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.320
That's…Grandfather's…!

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.730
Kazekage!

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.280
I know!

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.610
What is it?

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.530
Look at the scale of that!

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.610
To create a forest in an instant!

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.480
Everyone, beware of the pollen!

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.900
Do not inhale it!

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.860
Not just Deep Forest Emergence…

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.440
but Deep Forest Bloom as well?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.230
How dare that Kabuto!

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.150
There is no shinobi alive today

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.400
who is as powerful as the First Hokage, Hashirama Senju.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.820
Everyone says that.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.530
Just as they think that

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.530
the Sage of the Six Paths' power was also a fairytale.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.360
It's time to show them that all the fairy tales were real!

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.780
Wait, you bastard!

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.400
You were too distracted by the flowers… N-No! Raikage!

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.230
Humph… Time to burn things up…

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.030
Fire Style… Majestic Demolisher!

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.360
Mizukage!

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.380
The Will of Stone Water…Style…

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.430
I guess I am too old… to do anything!

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.840
Look, the left side is dirty!

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.380
That's a precious rock of the Hidden Stone!

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.010
Buff it more steadily!

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.220
You need to put more polish into your polishing!

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.380
His puns kill me…

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.760
Hmm?

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.510
Symbol of our village or not, it's just a plain old rock.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.930
Why don't we have Mountainside Images like the Hidden Leaf?

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.760
Lord Tsuchikage is such a cheapskate!

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.380
Ohnoki… I can tell the value of a stone just by looking at it.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.470
This rock… symbolizes our village's Will of Stone!

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.300
It's our bedrock!

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.550
Don't be such a miser with your words and use our symbol in your puns!

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.680
Well… You're right. This is just an ordinary rock.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.930
Whaaaaaat?!

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.720
W-What's the big idea, you stupid old man!

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.470
I can't tell which one it is now!

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.300
See…if you put a new one here like this, no one would know.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.510
What?!

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.260
What's important is the Will of Stone inside you…

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:09.050
You see, I can also tell the worth of someone's will just by looking at them.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.380
Ohnoki…

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.970
Hidden within your will is the power to change the world.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.180
But if you're not careful,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.800
that precious will of yours may disappear…

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.340
Disappear?

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.930
Why?!

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.180
That's not the agreement! Lord Hashirama said…

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.930
There is no alliance.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.010
Just obey the Hidden Leaf!

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.720
And…

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.510
Never mention that shinobi's name before me again!

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.510
Susano'o!

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.840
Barriers! As you keep running into barriers,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.010
you may abandon your will…

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.800
make excuses and even replace it with hatred.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.720
Listen closely, your will…

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.680
Never abandon it and always stride with pride!

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.340
Seems you still want to keep dancing…

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.340
But there's no strength left in your step!

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.180
I'm making excuses…

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.430
Particle Style: Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.380
Look at me being pitiful about my age…

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.510
I should be excused… for making an excuse!

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.340
What's this?

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.090
Ohnoki!

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.430
You're all awake!

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.630
All right!

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.680
Let's get on with our counterattack!

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.010
There he is!

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.720
You dance well.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.590
But your step is still too weak.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.340
That…looks like the First Hokage's face!

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.180
I didn't want to believe it, but…

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.430
That's why he's able to use the Wood Style!

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.300
And this is far different from

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.340
what Lord Orochimaru developed with Danzo.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.470
The First Hokage was more powerful than Madara.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:01.340
This fusion of both will be my ultimate weapon.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.840
No one can stop this Reanimation!

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.470
Wait!

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.430
Is that you, Itachi?!

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.510
I said…wait!

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.380
Susano'o!

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.220
This Susano'o…

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.300
So you are Itachi!

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.300
I'm surprised that you've been able to master it too…

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.300
What are you doing here?!

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.010
You're supposed to be dead!

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.430
This is Kabuto's jutsu…

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.050
I'm a Reanimation now.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.300
I can't stop now. There's something I have to do.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.340
I don't care!

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.340
You're here before me and I have a lot of questions!

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.340
Ask me later… But I guess that's not going to happen.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.430
You said so yourself!

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.880
To come find you once I had the same eyes as you!

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.800
So why are you running?

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.380
To avoid admitting that you lied to me?!

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.430
Or don't you have the courage to tell the truth?!

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.470
I already know… everything about you!

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.430
That's why I decided to destroy the Hidden Leaf!

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.880
I told you when we fought…

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.220
That people live under false assumptions…

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.630
I asked if you could think about it that way.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.340
And how one's reality might be an illusion.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.340
Is my truth really—

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.680
I no longer live inside an illusion!

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.130
And I can see through your genjutsu!

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.590
These are your eyes!

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.760
Sasuke understands your suffering and your resolve!

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.300
But instead of carrying on your will,

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.010
he intends to destroy the Hidden Leaf!

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.880
That's his way of getting back at the village that caused

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.430
his beloved older brother so much suffering!

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.430
You're as confident as ever,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.470
but I've heard about you from others.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.010
That you've changed a lot…

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.130
No! You changed everything about me!

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.130
I was supposed to die!

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.220
You were supposed to kill me along with our parents.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.630
But…

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.840
So Itachi made his decision.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:22.180
That he would drop the curtain himself on his own clan's history.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.050
He did not betray out of hatred.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.800
It was unavoidable.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.510
The discrimination by the village…

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.130
and the object of their antagonism…

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.470
He shouldered everything all by himself.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:39.220
No one can ever question Itachi's decision

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.380
and the sacrifice he made.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.720
What is this?!

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.680
Brother! Mother and Father were… Why?

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.050
Who could have done this?

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:05.010
Foolish brother… Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.550
Why me?!

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.300
Why did you spare me?!

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.800
He just couldn't bring himself to kill you.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.550
Do you know what that means?

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.930
Why me?!

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.470
How was I different from mother and father?

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.430
Why just me?

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.590
Because you didn't know anything.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.630
You had no part in the Uchiha Clan's folly.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.800
You were just a child.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.300
Also, do you think I did it just for you?

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.630
I wanted to be judged and dealt with only by another Uchiha.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.970
So I took advantage of the hatred inside you.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.590
That's why I failed.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.470
Ultimately, I filled you with hatred and made you go rogue.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.720
And turned you into a criminal!

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.510
Chidori!

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.680
All I wanted was for you to walk the right path.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.300
Before I died, I tried to lead you

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.720
down that one path without any forks or turns…

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.470
I changed the signposts

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.510
on that path with lies and my Visual Prowess.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.590
I was supposed to happily walk that one path,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.380
ignorant of everything?!

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:03.300
I…don't care for such a path!

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.880
Yeah… You're absolutely right.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.130
You must decide your own journey.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.130
No matter how much you try to rewrite the signposts,

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.470
my eyes can strip away the top layer!

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.970
What's so funny?!

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.050
Nothing…

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.880
I'm just realizing that

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.300
the signposts were not your only guides.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.220
I'm a dead man.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.470
There's no point in talking any further.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.720
When you were alive, you never paid any attention to me.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.220
Always flicking my forehead,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.340
saying "forgive me" and running off.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.340
Now you're dead, and you're still running away from me?!

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.380
I'm not running away.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.380
I told you.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.550
There's something I must do.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.680
I must stop…the Reanimation.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.430
You there…woman, user of the Medical Ninjutsu…

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.680
You have his blood running through your veins, don't you?

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.180
And what of it?!

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.430
I'll bring you down first.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.760
Taking out a unit's Medic Ninja first is an established tactic.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.300
Surely, you don't think we'd let you do that so easily, do you?

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.340
You're wrong…

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.340
It's because she's a descendant of Hashirama Senju.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.220
Your Medical Ninjutsu is only strong enough

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.800
to defer death for only a short while.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.300
Compared to Hashirama Senju, your jutsu is trivial.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:15.220
He was able to heal without even weaving signs.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.760
He was in another class in every jutsu.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.880
Everyone called him the most powerful shinobi.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.260
I fought a real death match against him…

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.470
This is child's play.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:45.720
Compared to him, what do you, his descendant, have to offer?

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.090
You can't even use the Wood Style…

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.590
Your Medical Ninjutsu doesn't even come close.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.680
And most of all, you're a weak woman!

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.010
Weakness disgusts me.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.800
And a weak Senju disgusts me even more!

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.380
You've gone on long enough!

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.470
I am a descendant of the first Hokage Hashirama…

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.300
And true, I don't use the Wood Style.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.680
My Medical Ninjutsu is pathetic compared to the First's,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.430
who didn't even have to weave signs!

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.550
And I am a woman…

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.260
A woman, yes… But not a weak woman.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.880
Simple strength isn't everything.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.840
It's something passed on to me,

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.720
and continues to flow from the First Hokage.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.300
That is my true power!

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:59.510
So don't you dare underestimate the Will of Fire!

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.930
This Reanimation Jutsu will not come undone even if you kill me.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.430
But I am the only one who can stop it.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.760
In other words, you can't kill me.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.720
I'll make you stop the Reanimation.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.300
This jutsu has neither risks nor weaknesses.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.840
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Risks of the Reanimation Jutsu"

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.430
Every jutsu has a weakness.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:09.220
