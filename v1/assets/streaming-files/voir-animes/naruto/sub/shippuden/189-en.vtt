WEBVTT

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.730
This is my chance!

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.610
Damn it!

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.230
No doubt! He's fast!

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.070
But…I'll try one more time!

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.780
He's so fast, I can't track them!

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.820
Do you think you can beat me with your Lariat?!

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.480
Octopops!

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.440
If you have time to worry about someone, worry about…

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.110
Why, Bee?!

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.530
Don't you get it yet, Bro? Fool, ya fool!

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.530
Thanks, Octopops!

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.780
Now I can get away from the Raikage…

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.860
No!

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.150
Hokage! You help too!

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.030
Lady Tsunade…

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.480
I'm not giving up…

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.980
Don't try to protect me! Naruto, stop!

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.030
If you die, your dreams, everything will be gone!

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.530
I'm all right.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.820
Enough! Move! And run!

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.110
Until I become Hokage, there's no way…

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.610
I'm gonna die.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.650
Granny!

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.610
Hokage!

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.030
You'd better have a good excuse for this!

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.650
Two Suns Hokage!

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.530
You'd better have a good excuse for this!

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.900
Even if you kill Naruto to buy us some time

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.150
until the Nine Tails comes back to life,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.530
I can't see the next Jinchuriki managing to control

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.400
the Nine Tail's power, to this degree!

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.650
Since we have no idea which way this war will go,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.610
I say we use all the weapons we've got,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.400
and not keep the Jinchuriki in hiding!

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.530
I will let Naruto pass!

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.530
Nice excuse!

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.730
I mean, now you're talking!

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.110
That's the Granny Hokage I know!

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.360
Hokage… Who's the one making arbitrary decisions now?!

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.900
Each one of you…

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.730
What evidence do you have that Naruto will succeed?!

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.980
I already told you that a Lariat like yours won't work!

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.690
Bro, ever since you became the Raikage,

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.780
you've underestimated my power, fool, ya fool!

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.110
No one ever expected the Third Raikage to die…

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.400
Where's Bro? Over there? Over here?

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.320
All of a sudden,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.860
he started punching his way out through the wall.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.320
There should be a bunch of holes in the walls now.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.190
Follow them to find him.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.860
All right, will do…

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.610
I'll look for Bro beyond the walls I go through.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.070
Hang in there, Bro.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.650
From today, you're the Raikage, y'know.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.610
I know that!

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.230
We're in the middle of a war!

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.530
As the Raikage,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.570
I will protect this village and this nation to the very end!

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.400
That is what my old man wanted!

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.980
Bee! Starting today, you will go to Unraikyo, the Storm Cloud Ravine,

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.150
to work on your Tailed Beast Bomb.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.650
You will not be engaging the enemy.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.650
But my Lariat… I don't need your Lariat anymore!

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.320
If the enemy attacks the village, you will stay and

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.860
take them out with your long-range Tailed Beast Bomb!

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.150
Remember! You are never to go outside the village ever again!

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.690
Bee, you and Naruto are precious Jinchuriki!

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.610
You are special to your villages and nations.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.320
That's why I'm saying you cannot go!

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.400
No matter how powerful a Jinchuriki is,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:10.780
the others have been captured by the Akatsuki and sealed.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.440
We ain't gonna lose, Naruto and me.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.440
That I can personally guarantee.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.690
Fine, let's put it to the test!

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.150
My Lariat against yours! We'll see who's stronger!

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.440
Bee, we still have a long way to go

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.610
before the Double Lariat is ideal.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.070
Right now, I'm toning down my power to match yours.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.400
You have to become stronger!

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:45.530
I'll surpass you some day, you'll see. On that day, I'll be carefree.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:51.980
That sounds ideal to me. Talking down to you is my fantasy.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.860
W-Wow…!

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.980
See, with Naruto and me…

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.480
it ain't just the power of the Jinchuriki.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.070
We have something stronger fundamentally.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.610
Your words to me, and me alone,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.280
before I became the Eight Tails…

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.030
They'll keep me strong, no matter what,

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.980
even when all else fails.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.400
Just "something"!

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.570
If I'm able to find it, I feel as though I can stay strong.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.570
Let Bee find that something.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.480
I see…

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.400
You are special to me!

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.730
We are the ultimate tag team!

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.440
What I said that day… at the Waterfall of Truth…?

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.110
So you finally understand, fool, ya fool!

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.150
Preaching at you from above is my fantasy.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.530
The fantasy is now a reality, oh yeah!

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.030
The enemy known as White Zetsu

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.610
uses a Transformation Jutsu that can even mimic chakra…

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.690
Is there a way to see through such a jutsu?

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.900
Nothing in these papers either.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.530
Shouldn't we inform Lord Raikage and Lady Hokage

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.400
about this situation?

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.400
No… We were put in charge here, so we'll deal with it.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.530
Besides, we want them to concentrate

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.530
on stopping Naruto and Bee.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.440
Well, about that… Lady Tsunade has already…

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.070
I'm looking through new information right now!

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.570
It's imperative that we find a solution right away!

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.360
Please! Let me focus.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.110
You are very special to me…

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.110
I do not deny that I said, "We are the ultimate tag team."

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:44.820
That's it?

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.360
Just those words are enough to keep you strong?

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.150
I don't just live and fight for the village and nation.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.440
I live and fight for you too, Bro!

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.650
Still you're way too overprotective, Bro.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.400
And you're losing faith in my strength, y'know.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.570
You lose a lot as a Jinchuriki… I tell ya, the heart grows empty.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:15.440
But it made me see what's dear to hold and now my heart is made of gold

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.530
Tailed Beast power isn't my foundation! Okay?!

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.400
Before the Tailed Beast became my mate,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.440
something inside me had started to illuminate.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.570
I saw that it was as big as the sun.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.900
And that's my true power, it's the one.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:37.440
That's why I can keep the Eight Tails reined in.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.610
Naruto has the same sun deep within.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.570
And he has two of 'em, it's amazing. Talk about a new innovation.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.280
You're right… It really is like the sun.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:57.690
Naruto Uzumaki, what are your two suns?

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.320
My mom and dad!

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.940
Your mother and father?

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.230
The Fourth Hokage and Kushina Uzumaki?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.110
But both of them died right after you were born.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.610
He must have experienced something

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.860
while training to control the Nine Tails' chakra.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.730
During Naruto's battle with Pain,

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.650
he started transforming into Nine Tails.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.940
Naruto mentioned that Minato appeared

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.070
and had put his essence into the seal's formula

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.980
to stop the transformation.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.440
I knew he wouldn't go down without a fight!

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.530
When I was trying to control Nine Tails' power…

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.900
Dad made sure to let me meet my mom.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.030
He wove her chakra into the seal,

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.190
so that if the Nine Tails' seal was undone,

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.980
Mom would come and see me.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.570
He did it all for me!

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.400
The Fourth Hokage studied

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.940
the unique Sealing Jutsu of the Uzumaki Clan…

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.610
And Kushina's chakra and life force were powerful…

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.190
It's possible.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.440
Just as I thought.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.070
When she gave me this power, Mom told me everything.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:24.440
That long ago, Dad fought with the same guy with the mask…

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.530
And he learned two things…

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.530
One was that this masked guy would try to destroy the future.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.400
And the other was that… The only one who could stop him

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.360
was the Jinchuriki who controlled the Nine Tails… Me!

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.400
A masked man… Was it Madara?

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.570
So Madara caused that Nine Tails' incident in the Hidden Leaf?

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.530
So the reason Minato sealed the Nine Tails in Naruto,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:02.190
but left a key to unlock the seal… was for this purpose?!

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.230
He never did anything that was unnecessary.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.980
So he concluded that this masked man, Madara,

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.690
posed an enormous threat to us.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.400
And that only the one who controlled the Nine Tails' power

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.440
had a chance of defeating him…

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.820
So he chose Naruto…

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.440
So Minato entrusted everything to you?

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.280
He knew he wasn't the savior?

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.690
I don't know if Dad ever considered himself

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.360
to be a savior or not.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.530
But my master told me that Dad was the Child of Prophecy…

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.400
the savior.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.650
Do you recall what I told you earlier?

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.570
That savior, Minato, is dead.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.570
Don't you think that was a failure?

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.780
You're right. My dad died.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.190
He died along with my mom, trying to protect Hidden Leaf Village

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.230
from the enemy and the Nine Tails!

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.820
Trying to protect me!

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.780
It only lasted a moment…

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.110
But in that moment, they gave me something.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.320
They gave me the belief that

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.940
I am capable of lots and lots and lots of things!

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.570
And they entrusted me to be the savior of the world!

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.400
Raikage!

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.900
If you kill Naruto to try to stall the enemy,

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.530
then this time for sure, the Nine Tails will be taken!

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.650
And it will definitely spell the end of the world!

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.940
Only Naruto can control the Nine Tails' power.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.320
Just as Minato believed!

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.030
Letting Naruto go is the way to protect shinobi, and everyone!

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.110
My bet is on Naruto!

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.780
So what is your decision?!

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.360
Let me go too, fool, ya fool!

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.530
Like you always said, I'm a big fool too.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.780
And Naruto here is just like me… Don't you agree?

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.400
But to succeed, you need fools like us

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.690
who don't care at all how big or strong the wall!

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.980
Yahoo!

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.400
Bro's at top speed, you can't go much faster!

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.650
I think he wants to kill Naruto… This can become a disaster!

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.610
As always, you're so stubborn. I have no choice, but to join in!

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.730
I can't involve Granny in this!

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.030
Here I come, Naruto!

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.860
A lot of people have put their trust in me.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.480
I won't fail!

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.530
I shoulder many responsibilities too.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.400
I won't fail!

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.480
He dodged it?!

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.980
Fool, ya fool! He really is…

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.780
…just like the Yellow Flash!

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.900
You're right, Raikage…

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.650
If I fail, I'm not a savior.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:01.530
So I will not fail! Just like my dad didn't.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:09.280
Just like my savior dad taught me!

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.480
I just wanted to see for myself…

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.980
So I came at you, with intent to kill.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:21.150
You're only the second one to ever outrun my fastest punch.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:27.320
It seems the savior is alive… within you.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.190
Now go.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.030
Right!

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.480
This is the only way.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.530
According to this data, when Naruto is in Nine Tails' chakra mode,

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.860
he can sense the enemy's hostility.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.690
He'll be able to see through the white being's Transformation Jutsu.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.860
Furthermore, we can deploy Naruto's shadow clones

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.650
to each battlefield to counter them.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:07.320
If we delay any longer, there will be no turning back!

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.530
The only problem is…

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.690
This is a war to protect Naruto, a Jinchuriki.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.360
Throwing into him into battle

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.730
would be like getting our priorities backwards.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.940
In the first place, Lord Raikage would never allow it.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.030
That's true.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.900
Well…

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.440
About that… That doesn't seem to be the case.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.860
The long night is finally coming to an end.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.530
They should be able to use their eyes now.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.650
New Pains of the Six Paths using Jinchuriki.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.480
I've just added a little something…

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.440
Strafing against the Blunt Blade Helmet Splitter

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.480
has no effect whatsoever!

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.030
Trying to block me is meaningless!

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.730
This next attack will be your last!

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.570
Not yet! I hope you don't think this will be over soon.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.530
There's no way to block the Blunt Blade Helmet Splitter!

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:59.780
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Helmet Splitter: Jinin Akebino!"

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.150
Who said anything about blocking?! THE HELMET SPLITTER: JININ AKEBINO!

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:05.230
THE HELMET SPLITTER: JININ AKEBINO!

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.360
Tune in again!
