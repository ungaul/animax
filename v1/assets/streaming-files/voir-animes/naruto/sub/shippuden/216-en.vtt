WEBVTT

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.550
Reanimation Jutsu: Release!"

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.590
All right! We've cornered him!

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.550
Just when I thought I regained consciousness,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.760
this happens…

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.380
What's that?!

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.930
You're strong, after all… Pakura Sensei.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.050
Maki…?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.090
Pakura Sensei?!

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.510
Let me out!

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.510
I've had it! I'm completely fed up!

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.380
I'm gonna explode, hmm!

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.300
You okay with that, huh?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.880
We got you sealed with the Lightning Style,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.800
especially so you can't explode.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.510
So shut your trap! You dud!

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.470
There are no such things as duds in art!

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.340
Huh?!

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.510
No way, an explosion?!

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.550
What is it?!

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.510
What is this?

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.840
Dan!

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.840
Yeah. Looks like someone succeeded.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.010
Naruto! The Jinchuriki are gonna quit it!

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.380
Looks like Itachi did it!

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.300
Thanks, Itachi!

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.470
But this battle ain't going anywhere!

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.010
No time to waste! Let's go!

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.680
Tell Ohnoki…

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.930
He must secure the future of the Allied Shinobi Forces…

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.470
Only then can he come and tell me all about it…

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.930
Just what the hell is going on?

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.510
I get it… The bookworm's been taken down…hmm.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.470
It was a dud. Don't scare us like that.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.090
It wasn't a dud!

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.300
Art is…

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.180
indestructible!

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.630
Scaring us like that…

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.430
Granny Chiyo!

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.130
Looks like I'm free of the cursed spell.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.880
Pakura Sensei!

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.630
Maki, do not die in vain!

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.380
Sensei…

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.380
You all have a future…

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.470
Looks like I can finally die…

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.180
Granny Chiyo!

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.590
Kankuro…

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.510
I entrust you with the techniques of the Puppet Master.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.550
I accept and will take it over… Granny Chiyo.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.180
No need to play possum anymore!

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.970
As expected, I can control my body freely now.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.130
Choza, please undo the barrier.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.300
It's safe now.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.300
It seems that way…

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.510
Everyone, there's no need for the barrier.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.430
Right!

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.300
Choza, forgive me.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.220
Those signs are for the Ghost Transformation Jutsu, aren't they?

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.380
I understand.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.840
Please hurry to Lady Tsunade's side!

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.840
This jutsu has killed so many shinobi…

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.130
I couldn't have imagined that it would come in handy like this!

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.380
Ghost Transformation Jutsu!

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.220
Just as I thought!

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.090
Souls ascending after being released from the Reanimation Jutsu

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.220
can be controlled with this jutsu too.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.840
But it doesn't seem like you have much time.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.880
Please hurry!

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.970
Yeah…

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.340
Farewell, Choza! Thank you for everything!

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.840
Amazing… He flew off like a ghost!

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.880
Just what is the Ghost Transformation Jutsu?

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.430
It allows one to become a living ghost

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.430
that can span long distances to kill a foe…

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.180
Originally, that is.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.470
Tsunade…

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.760
Reform is necessary for the future of our village.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.840
In order to keep the lives sacrificed… to a minimum.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.720
You're right.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.470
Help me, Tsunade.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.840
If I can be of help to you…

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.300
I need you.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.510
Dan…

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
Let's make our dreams come true!

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.630
Yes.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.260
Our dreams as shinobi.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.550
What's going on?

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.630
Reanimation chakra is fading steadily!

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.590
We have reports coming in from each battlefield.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.470
The reanimated are turning into souls.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.090
Even the sealed ones, even ones still fighting!

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.510
The only way to explain the situation is that…

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.510
the Reanimation has been released…

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.300
There's no mistake.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.970
The Reanimation Jutsu has been released!

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.180
All right!

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.340
Relay this news to every company!

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.590
Reporting from Headquarters.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.430
The Reanimation has been released.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:38.880
I repeat!

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.470
The Reanimation Jutsu has been undone!

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.970
Amazing! They're all disappearing!

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.180
But…

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.050
Which company managed to do this?

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.130
You don't ever have to forgive me.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.760
And no matter what you do from here on out…

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.340
I will love you always.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.090
I…

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.680
Yugito…

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.800
Yagura…

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.510
Han…

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.380
Utakata…

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.380
Fuu…

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.590
Old Man Beard!

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.300
Just leave it to us!

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.380
They're gone.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.010
Then this means the other battles are…

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.180
Curse Kabuto, he's failed.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.720
Hey, what are you looking at?!

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.380
You're fighting me!

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.680
As well as the Green Beast!

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.050
Looks like the Reanimation has been released.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.510
And… what of it?

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.130
What is…that light?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.430
The Susano'o is gone and now…

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.720
the debris from the Reanimation is in a fierce whirlwind.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.680
Without a doubt, this means…

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.300
The Reanimation has been released.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.430
What?!

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.430
We haven't located Kabuto yet.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.010
It's too soon!

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.180
Even if Kabuto was found, to be able to stop this jutsu…?

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.630
Who could have done this?

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.340
It doesn't matter!

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.840
Whoever did it is a hero who's saved the Shinobi World!

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.180
The heavens haven't forsaken us yet!

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.050
It appears you have able shinobi on your side too.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.470
It can't be helped…

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.340
He was prepared for this?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840
Not yet!

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.880
He's planning a final strike before he disappears!

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.800
Watch out!

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.930
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Caterwaul!

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.380
Water Style… No… It won't make it in time!

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.590
Lady Hokage!

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.470
I'm all right!

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.510
The 100 Healings Jutsu has worn off!

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.630
But…

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.340
we've won…

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.340
Damn!

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:49.510
What was that?!

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.300
I thought she completely lost consciousness!

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.970
I couldn't move anymore… So how?

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:59.130
It's been a long time…Tsunade.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.130
It's me, Dan.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.550
Dan… How are you here?!

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.340
The Reanimation has been undone.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.510
And I flew over here with my Ghost Transformation Jutsu.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.630
But that was a close one!

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.130
Dan…

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.760
You haven't changed at all…Tsunade.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.220
Dan… I have always honored your…

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.430
There's no time to wallow in sentimentalities.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.510
I have to go.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.340
But…

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.510
Fighting and losing precious people…

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.220
is not all there is to being a shinobi.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.470
I love this village and my comrades.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.470
So I want to protect them.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.090
A person that protects everyone…

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.720
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.340
Dan!

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.470
I ran from my memories of you for a long time,

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.380
after your death.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.880
But I've changed!

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.340
And now… I can confirm with you what all your regrets

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.130
and the things you wanted to do were!

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.630
I've become the Hokage!

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.130
But… Thank you, Tsunade.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.180
You are fulfilling my dreams for me just fine.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.380
I really caused you a lot of pain.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.180
I'm sorry.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.180
I'll be waiting for you on the other side.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.630
But don't come too quickly, okay?

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.680
For you yourself are my dream.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.130
I was able to protect you at the end…

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.760
It appears a little bit of good did come from being reanimated.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.510
Hokage, are you all right?!

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.180
Your vitality has returned.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.130
And you received chakra?

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.680
I got to see an old friend for just a little while…

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.550
Well, you'll meet again right away.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.470
What? What's going on anyway?

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.050
Madara's chakra which had begun

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.430
to separate from his body is now clinging firmly to it.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.300
Is he back to his original state?

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.220
Why? Why won't he disappear?!

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.840
I thought the Reanimation was undone!

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.510
Reanimation is a jutsu that summons the dead.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.470
However, there is one risk…

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:49.930
Risk?

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.380
As long as one knows the signs,

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:58.300
the reanimated dead can rescind the Reanimation Contract

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.220
from their end.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.930
Rescind the contract?!

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.130
When that happens,

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.470
you end up with the biggest problem of all.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:15.260
An immortal body with infinite chakra… that can move without control.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.260
Impossible!

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.300
Tell the jutsu caster…

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.430
Never use a Forbidden Jutsu carelessly.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.760
Reanimation, release!

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.430
What is a clan?

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.800
What is a village?

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.590
What is…a shinobi?

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.510
What am I?

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.550
Found you!

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.430
You guys…?

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.380
What're you doing here?

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.260
Stopping the Reanimation.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:43.630
Huh?

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.340
You've always been like that.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.470
You never explain things to people.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.550
Well, it's been awhile since we saw you,

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.340
so you'd better tell us!

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.510
What?

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:03.880
It's Kabuto…

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.300
Huh?

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.590
Kabuto was using the Reanimation.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.050
How… How can that be…?

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.180
Your ridiculously juvenile jutsu can't hold me.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.260
You should know that after fighting me, right?

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.340
Now then… The Perfect Susano'o…

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.680
Everyone who sees it dies… or so they say.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.880
I'm almost embarrassed to have to do this again.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.720
I already used it once…

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.840
My interest has waned, thanks to the interference.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.880
Perhaps I ought to go retrieve Nine Tails instead.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.260
What?

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.090
Let us deal with this Madara!

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.130
I swear we shall finish him off!

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.970
So relax and leave him to us!

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.970
Lord Tsuchikage!

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.220
We cannot stop him.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.300
We still have to fight!

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.470
We must stop him here!

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.380
So sad…

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:29.300
Lightning Cable!

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:31.340
Guy!
Right!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.340
Take this! Pinky Attack!

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.680
Heh! You don't look too happy!

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.180
What's that supposed to mean?

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.090
Since you're hiding your face, I can only guess.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.220
If you feel insulted, take off that mask

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.550
and show us how composed you are!

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.590
Stupid!

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.380
Nice going, Naruto!

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.470
I told him not to rile up his opponent.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.800
Well… It seems I have no choice but to use it.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.300
What is that?!

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.430
A giant gourd and a bottle…

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:37.050
Frankly, I wanted to revive this when the conditions were perfect.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.930
It's only a fragment, but it's not lacking in power.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.550
It's taking too long.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.010
It's time!

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.430
We found something incredible in one of the hideouts.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.760
Take a look at this!

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.510
This is it! Someone who is all-knowing.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.220
I have to meet up with someone. I'm leaving.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.720
Huh? Who?

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.010
Orochimaru.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:55.050
What are you talking about? You killed Orochimaru!

00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:00.300
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Orochimaru's Return"

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.380
Don't underestimate Orochimaru.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.090
OROCHIMARU'S RETURN Tune in again!
