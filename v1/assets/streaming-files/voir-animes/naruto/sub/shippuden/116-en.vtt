WEBVTT

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.600
Earth Style: Mud Wall!

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.800
Lightning Blade!

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.470
What was that?!

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.330
Kakashi Hatake the Copy Ninja...

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.870
I'm honored to meet you.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.370
Where is the Nine-Tails?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.630
That...is a silly question.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.920
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.010
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.430
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.350
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.150
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.450
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.660
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.290
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:22.920
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.920
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.090
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:38.310
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.810
koete Someday...

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.800
Pain vs. Kakashi

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.970
Over there!

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.170
Pa!

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.330
I'm coming too!

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.770
Let's go!

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.470
What was that jutsu just now?

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.430
It felt different from a shock wave...

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.930
Everything around him was blasted away,

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.270
with him as the epicenter.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.030
Then...

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.700
How will you counter this?

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.470
Not just physical attacks...

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.430
He can repel Ninjutsu as well?!

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.200
Impressive.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.470
Now then, how should I...?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800
Another one?

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.030
You're mine!

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.800
This guy... He was facing directly ahead, yet...

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.930
I see...

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.100
They're eyes are linked!

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.330
Their field of vision is connected and shared.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.570
When you face Pain, you must only fight them one-on-one.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.830
Remember this well.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.070
Each of them can use only one type of skill.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.630
Deducing those skills will be crucial.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.030
Lord Jiraiya took on six of them at once?!

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.730
I must say... That's crazy...

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.600
 I get it! That's his ability!

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.300
Pain...

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.270
I have no chance if I fight them alone.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.900
I must call for reinforcements,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.130
and let them know what this one's ability is!

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.930
I have to do as much as my body can handle!

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.830
Damn...

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.130
A Lightning Style Shadow Clone!

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.270
One down...

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.630
Kakashi?

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.230
Actually, I was all set too.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.130
But this will help me preserve some chakra.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.070
Thank you.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.830
Are you all right?

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.100
Yes... Well... I'll manage.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.170
A Trap Shadow Clone...

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.400
He had already planted it back then.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.170
Until he can confirm an opponent's abilities,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.330
Kakashi always uses Substitute and Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.030
Hasn't changed since the last time we teamed up.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.670
Skilled as always.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.430
Which means...

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.700
Do you have enough chakra?

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.630
I've already used my Lightning Style Shadow Clone

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.700
and exhausted over half my chakra.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.830
To be honest, a drawn-out battle against a formidable opponent like him

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.070
is going to be difficult for me.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.930
However, I've figured out a little of his abilities.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.430
Pa, he's coming!

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.030
Almighty Push...

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.930
There!

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.430
That's...

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.170
What did he just do?

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.430
He repelled all our attacks.

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.530
Using himself as the epicenter,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.730
his jutsu allows him to pull in or push objects away.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.330
Similar to the magnetic laws of attraction and repulsion...

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.070
However, it seems he cannot utilize that jutsu consecutively.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.470
I know for certain that there is an interval of time

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.470
before he can activate the next jutsu.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.430
Everyone else has been taken down!

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.270
If he can repel all attacks, how do we defeat him?

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.370
The interval between jutsu seems short too.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.930
We can't get close.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.130
However, that's our only chance.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.930
I have an idea.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.430
And I need your help.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.370
You move quite well...

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.100
And you have a wide range of jutsu.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.230
People like you need to be killed,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.100
or you may pose a problem later.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:58.300
Now!

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.270
- Double... - Human... - Boulder! - Boulder!

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.630
Too slow...

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.730
Kakashi Hatake!

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.130
He planted this chain underground before attacking from below!

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.630
Lightning Blade!

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.330
Go, Kakashi Sensei!

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.630
Finish him, Kakashi!

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.630
The other Pain! He could still move?!

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.130
Make it in time!

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.870
Your inability to move... doesn't seem faked.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.770
I didn't make it...

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.730
I know that you're not a Shadow Clone.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.400
I shall make certain of your death...

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:27.900
It's over.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.100
But just to be safe... I will not approach you.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.500
Humph... Know pain.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.730
The damage is devastating...

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.500
No...

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.170
Everyone, let us hurry!

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.370
- Yes! - Let us hurry. Let us hurry.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.330
Now, hurry.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.270
Pa...

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.500
Kakashi Sensei!

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.470
I'm done with first-aid treatment.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.300
Please finish with the splint.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.530
Right... Sakura!

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.570
One more wounded! Hurry!

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:23.630
All right.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.930
Please lay him down there.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.200
Pa...

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.500
You tried to protect me...

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.870
Save the crying for later...Choji...

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.500
If...you are able to move...

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.600
report to Lady Tsunade about Pain's abilities.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.900
A counter strategy is imperative!

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.000
K-Kakashi...Sensei?

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.900
Reflect later!

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.930
You must...hurry!

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.100
Run!

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.230
But... I... I...

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.930
Don't let Choza's sacrifice be in vain!

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.070
Persistent fellows, aren't you?

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.900
Damn it... He's still...!

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.430
He's after Choji!

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.000
Pa...!

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.100
Pa... Thank you for everything you've done.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:35.670
Just you watch!

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.300
Run! Choji!

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.900
I daresay with the chakra I have left

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.030
it's impossible to destroy his entire body.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.000
And...if I use it one more time,

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.700
I'll exhaust all my stamina and chakra.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.000
My life will be...

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.600
To entrust this piece of information to those who still live.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.270
This is the best method I have right now to save the Hidden Leaf!

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.870
I get it...

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:57.470
So...he also...got by... with that Ocular Jutsu...

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.830
Well...it seems this is it for me, too.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.030
Obito... Rin...

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.900
Whatever the village may say...

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.130
You are a great jonin.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.970
I'm about to die...

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:45.200
But...I'll become your eyes and see the future for you.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.900
Take care of Rin...

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.330
Obito...

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.500
Seems this is as far as it goes...

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.730
for me to see the future as your eyes.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.400
I wasn't able to protect Rin...

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.630
I keep breaking my promises to you.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Forgive me.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.100
Obito... Rin... Sensei...

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:42.030
I'll...be joining you now.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.770
Is that you, Kakashi?

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.270
So this is where you were...

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.900
Will you tell me your story?

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.970
Sure... It's a really long story, so I want to take my time.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.130
Yeah...that's fine.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.970
Well... Father...

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.230
Is something wrong?

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.370
Lady Tsunade!

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.830
U-Um...

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.400
Katsuyu has already attached herself

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.770
to most of the people of the village.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.470
Sorry. Let us continue...

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:04.900
Lady Tsunade!

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.630
We cracked the ability of one of our enemies!

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.630
Tell me.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:18.900
He is male. Between 25-30 years of age.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.000
Distinguishing marks are piercings,

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.130
six in his nose and seven in his ears.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.230
His ability is a jutsu that

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.230
simulates magnetic attraction and repulsion.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.700
He can attract targeted objects to himself.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.800
And he can repel every ninjutsu attack.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.100
Repel?! All of them?

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:42.070
Yes! However, once he uses either jutsu,

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.300
there is a five-second interval.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.970
Five seconds... That's all?

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.130
You did well to report this!

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.070
Our sacrifices will lessen considerably.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.170
Pass on this information to everyone via Katsuyu!

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.270
- Yes, ma'am! - Yes, ma'am!

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.370
Team Choza provided back-up for Kakashi Sensei

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.570
against two of the enemies...

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.870
It is believed everyone except myself perished.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.270
Go back to Choza!

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.870
Take him to the hospital immediately!

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.200
He can still be saved.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.530
Huh?!

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.400
Then...Pa is... Yes...

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:36.000
Thank goodness! I'm so glad!

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.270
Kakashi... What about Kakashi Sensei?!

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.930
Just hurry, Choji...

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.400
I was told each Pain could only use one skill.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.030
Then it's strange...

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.630
Lord Jiraiya defeated the Pain who can use Summoning Jutsu.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:50.030
I saw her when reading through the Hidden Rain ninja's mind...

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.530
But what's going on?! She was clearly a corpse!

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.730
Inoichi... Please tell me more in detail.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.870
We will uncover his mystery together!

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.730
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Mystery of Pain"

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.670
Tune in again!
