WEBVTT

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.730
At last!

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.230
The world of the Infinite Tsukuyomi is now here!

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.400
Naruto! You can't right now!

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.030
Don't go outside!

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.690
Without my Susano'o's protection,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.980
you'd be bound up in his genjutsu as well!

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.880
Itachi's Story – Light and Darkness: Birth and Death

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.970
FIRE What in the world is going on?!

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.220
WIND

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.970
EARTH

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.670
LIGHTNING

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.970
WATER

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.970
Just what is this?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.420
Are they inside?

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.130
Blocking the light with the Susano'o?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.840
What's going on outside right now?

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.470
Sasuke?

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.470
What difference will it make, knowing that?

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.090
There is nothing you can do right now.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.630
Sasuke… That's not the point.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.090
Naruto and I also want to know.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.550
In order to analyze our next move,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.010
Sakura is… Kakashi… You're being just like Sakura now.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.840
Just be quiet for a bit.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.050
Hey, Sasuke!

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.300
We need to work as a team!

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.800
Team 7 needs to work together to bring Madara down!

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.800
You're right. There's nothing I can do right now…

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.170
Kakashi Sensei!

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.630
If you can analyze what's outside with your left eye,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.420
Sasuke…

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.840
you should be the one to lead Team 7's four-man squad.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840
Huh?!

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.920
I doubt he's better at planning than either you or Sakura!

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.380
Although he may be better than me…

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.970
Anyway…

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.630
Madara has activated his jutsu.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.050
It's a powerful genjutsu.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.510
I suspect everyone outside has fallen under its spell.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.170
We might be the only ones

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.630
left unaffected.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.880
The Infinite Tsukuyomi, huh?

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.880
So right about now, everyone's…

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.550
Inside a dream.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.170
Lord Kiba!

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.840
I think I'll start by establishing a new holiday called Dog Day!

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.050
It's the Hokage's Decree!

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.130
Everyone will own a dog!

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.630
Go get a dog!

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.760
It's the Hokage's Decree!

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.840
I've finally found a new species!

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.010
There, there…

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.300
Wow!

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.920
What a feast! This looks so tasy!

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.050
I went all out and cooked all this just for you, dear!

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.840
Looks like you've found a fan!

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.170
Thanks for the food!

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.880
I just love gluttons! I think they're so manly!

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.880
I'm sorry… I ate your share too.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.470
It's okay… There's so much more!

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.970
I am so happy!

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.670
How many times do I have to tell you?!

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.840
If you're going to be late coming back from a mission,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.130
let me know!

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.300
I made dinner for nothing,

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.130
- Marriage is such a drag. - and you kept me waiting.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.630
I think I'll pass.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.090
- Haven't you learned after all these years? - Yeah.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.170
I won't let you have Ino.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.380
Ino is my woman… Get lost!

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.380
No, she is my woman.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.420
Stop fighting, both of you!

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.340
My daughter's so popular.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.220
This is such a pain!

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.970
Great Leaf Hurricane!

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.130
Youth prevails!

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.800
Oh, Lee!

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.220
I love you!

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.050
S-Sakura!

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.380
- Sai! - Sai!

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.220
Oh, Sai.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.510
Hey, Sai.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.880
Good morning, everyone.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.010
'Morning.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.050
You have a really nice smile, as usual.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.920
Do you think so?

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.920
You really do have a beautiful smile, Sai.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.300
It is super cool!

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.010
Oh… Sai! Your smile's the best in the Hidden Leaf!

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.260
I've finally perfected it!

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.380
It flies! It moves! My ultimate puppet!

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.720
He embodies all the dreams of the Sand!

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.420
You will be the guardian deity of the Sand!

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.340
Let's go!

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.170
Elder Sister, Elder Sister!

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.760
Please help me. I need to pick your brain!

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.800
Calm down. What is it?

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.970
You see… Hold on!

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.050
Let me discuss something with you first!

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.300
You're the Kazekage now. Make your own decisions.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.170
No!

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.670
I really want to hear your opinion!

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.170
Me too! Please, Elder Sister!

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.170
It just has to be you! Elder Sister!

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.050
Elder Sister!

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.260
My little brothers are so hopeless.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.880
And then Gaara—!

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.970
Is that so? At the Academy?

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:58.840
Uh-huh!
Lord Gaara.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.050
Your friend is here to see you.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.220
Hey!

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.170
What are we gonna play today?

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.970
Let's go outside!

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.010
Gaara…

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.130
Don't stay out too late.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.050
Uh-huh.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.380
So when can we get outta here?

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.090
It seems the genjutsu runs on moonlight.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.550
Which will gradually wane.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800
But as long as there's light, it's useless.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.590
Damn it!

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.470
I need to tell you everything before we part.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.630
There's no need to lie anymore.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.800
I'll show you the entire truth.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.970
These are Itachi's memories!

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.340
Back then, Itachi told me about the discord

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.050
between the Hidden Leaf and the Uchiha…

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.010
but that wasn't all.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.010
These aren't just memories…

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.970
It's Itachi's knowledge, his thoughts, his suffering…

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.920
I will love you always…

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.050
It's everything that Itachi Uchiha the shinobi was…

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.090
Madara… Don't talk about the Uchiha.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.170
The only one who has that right is my Big Brother.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.170
So this is…the Great Ninja War.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.580
Water! Water!

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.500
Th-Thank you…

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.790
Ninja Tools?

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.290
Father…

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.370
Why did this shinobi try to kill me?

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.290
I didn't do anything…

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.370
Because this is war.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.250
"War"?

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.370
It's not a war between people.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.620
It's a war between nations.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.670
That's why strangers kill each other meaninglessly.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.670
Is that what it is?

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.750
That is what the shinobi world is.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.330
Listen, Itachi…

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.170
Never forget this sight…

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.620
Uh-huh.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.290
We managed an armistice, but the sacrifice was just too great.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.620
Lord Third intends to take full responsibility and retire.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.620
There are voices in support of installing you, Captain, as the Fourth Hokage.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.750
- Please… - Enough talk.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.500
What should we do about Kakashi Hatake?

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.170
He doesn't belong to our clan, but he possesses the Sharingan.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.960
I understand Obito Uchiha fought bravely.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.540
Let's respect his wishes.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.040
We should bring the Sharingan back to the Uchiha…

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.830
The war just ended.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.580
Do not sow seeds of discord.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.620
Yes, sir.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.870
We finally have peace.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.370
We will persevere to maintain it.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.580
That is the duty of the Uchiha…

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.670
Grieving over the dead is meaningless.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.920
If there's any meaning in death, it's to take advantage of it.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.750
What is the meaning of life?

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.460
There is none.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.370
There's meaning in life if it's eternal.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.120
There's no meaning…

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.250
in life?

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.790
No one wants to die, right?

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.670
You guys…

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.040
What is life, anyway?

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.330
Please take care.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.830
Thank you very much!

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:33.670
Mom…

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:34.830
What is it?

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.250
Are you sick?

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.170
Oh, it's nothing like that.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.040
You see…

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.250
You're going to have a little brother or sister.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.830
Yes. You're going to be a big brother.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.120
Mom, I want a little brother.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.040
But a sister will be cute too, wouldn't it?

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.290
I have a feeling it's going to be a little brother.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:08.750
Oh!

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:10.290
It's snowing!

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.620
It will be born in the summer.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.210
It's a boy! He's your little brother.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:36.710
A life…

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.210
A new life.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.250
Have you decided on a name?

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.420
Yes.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.170
Sasuke…

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.080
Sasuke Uchiha.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.830
Oh… It's a fine name, but that's…

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:57.120
Yes, it's Lord Third's father's name. I've already asked Lord Third.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.540
I see.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.120
Sasuke…

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.710
We shall raise him to never dishonor his name.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.790
There, there, Itachi!

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.750
Itachi!

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:13.120
Itachi!

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.920
I'm like that too.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:31.500
Birth…death…birth…death…

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.500
Hey, hey!

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.500
Aren't you Itachi? An Uchiha in my class?

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:39.920
Let's play together.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.960
What do you want to do today?

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.170
Kick the can! Let's play kick the can!

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.040
Huh? We played that yesterday!

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.830
Hey! Are you dissing us?

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:54.830
Say something!

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.960
I have shuriken training right now.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.960
- Wow... - Wow... Well then…

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.500
Let's practice shuriken too!

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.250
No, don't!

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.170
That kid!

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.620
Trying to act cool! What a stuck-up!

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.170
Hey, you guys. Stop it!

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.500
Shut up! This is between us guys!

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.000
Life is born.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.870
Life dies.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.620
Life is…a battle…

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.750
Hey! Don't run away!

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.500
Wow!

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.830
Was it a girl?

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.540
It's a boy.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:02.870
He's so cute!

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.830
What's your name?

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.750
Hey Mom…

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.000
Is Lord Fourth going to have a baby too?

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.040
Yes, I wonder what it'll be.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.080
I'll be going out tonight, so go ahead and have dinner.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.120
Okay.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.620
Your father's working too, so please watch Sasuke.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.670
Uh-huh.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.500
It's a full moon tonight, Sasuke.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.080
What is this?

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.210
Welcome home, father! Please teach me jutsu!

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.290
Jutsu?

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.210
Aren't they teaching you at the Academy?

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.540
It's too easy.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.080
As expected from my son. I guess it would be for you.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.960
Wait for me at the training grounds.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.170
Make sure you're home by dinner.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.570
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Genius"

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.210
Okay, I got it.
