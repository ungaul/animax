WEBVTT

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.670
I-Is this is...a genjutsu?

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.600
These guys are cleverly using each other's attacks to divert attention.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.500
And I fell for it. Damn it!

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.570
Can't...move...

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.030
I killed him! I killed the guy!

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.130
Who's next?!

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.400
You're lying!

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.730
That's nonsense!

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.270
No, it can't be.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.030
Stop joking around. Who'd believe that story?

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.970
It's not a lie. That's the truth about Itachi.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.070
He died for Sasuke's sake and for the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.870
What does that mean?

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.070
Even if it is true, if Sasuke is aware of this,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.070
why would he help the Akatsuki?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.570
Knowing him, he would return to the Hidden Leaf to carry on Itachi's will.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.130
As Sasuke's teacher and his friends,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.730
you might have assumed you understood Sasuke's true feelings.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.700
But you were badly mistaken.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.300
He's the real thing. A true avenger. That's what he is.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.770
Did you turn Sasuke into that?!

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.730
No, I didn't.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.970
Sasuke chose this himself.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.370
It's a lie!

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.030
I took a gamble too.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.100
Would Sasuke carry on Itachi's wishes,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.630
or would he seek revenge against the Hidden Leaf?

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.470
He chose vengeance.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.500
In essence, he was meant to be on our side.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.530
Sasuke's goal at this moment is to take revenge against the Hidden Leaf

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.730
for what they did to Itachi and the Uchiha Clan.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Why?

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.770
Why him?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.670
Why did this happen?

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.200
How could he turn to revenge?!

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.670
It was inevitable.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.200
It is the Uchiha Clan's blood-soaked destiny of hate.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.230
Like a curse that has been passed down through the ages.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.830
A curse?

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.130
Yes. A curse of hatred, which started generations ago

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.700
with the Sage of the Six Paths who is said to be the founder of the ninja.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.500
The Sage of the Six Paths?

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.400
That's just a myth.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.400
The Rinnegan was no more than a mutation!

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.230
Myths are born from truth.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.500
Long ago, the Sage of the Six Paths preached the Ninshu

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.530
and tried to lead the way to peace.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.370
But before he could realize his dream, time ran out.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.770
The Sage of the Six Paths decided to entrust the power and will of the Ninshu

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.770
to his two children.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.200
The older son was born with the Sage's eyes.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.100
He inherited the Sage's chakra and mental energy,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.870
and believed that strength was crucial to peace.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.000
The younger son was born with the gift of the Sage's body.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.170
He inherited the Sage's life force and physical energy,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.000
and believed that love was crucial to peace.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.130
Ultimately, the Sage was forced to choose his successor from his deathbed.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.300
However, his decision

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.000
created a curse of hatred that has continued for generations.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.500
What do you mean by that?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.770
Instead of his older son, who sought strength,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.900
the Sage felt that the younger son, who sought love,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.430
was more suitable, and named him as his successor.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.130
The firstborn, who had long expected to follow in his father's footsteps,

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.700
could not accept the decision.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.130
Filled with rage, he challenged his younger brother.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.870
Even as time passed and new generations were born,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.670
the descendants of the two brothers, continued to battle.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.470
The descendants of the older brother, came to be known as the Uchiha.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.030
And the descendants of the younger brother were called the Senju.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.370
As Madara Uchiha, my battle with the First Hokage, Hashirama Senju,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.000
was destined to take place.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.700
This is only the second time I've met you.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.030
But I can tell that you hold the Senju's Will of Fire within you.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.630
I can see the First Hokage inside you.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.870
Even after death, he lives on.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.730
He, whom I admired, yet he was my rival.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.330
And the man I hated most.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.370
The Senju and the Uchiha.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.700
The Will of Fire and hatred.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.770
Naruto and Sasuke.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:47.430
You both will probably be the next chosen by fate.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.170
The Uchiha was destined to be a clan of vengeance.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.900
Sasuke has shouldered the entire burden of the Uchiha's hatred

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.200
and intends to strike the world with that curse.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.200
It is the most powerful weapon.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.170
It's his friend and source of power, this thing called hatred.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.270
And it is Sasuke's Ninja Way!

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.600
Sasuke's Ninja Way

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.300
Chidori.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.500
Elbow Bolt!

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.730
A thrust attack using the Lightning Style to increase force and penetration.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.300
The same jutsu used by Kakashi Hatake!

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.300
I wear Lightning Style armor, yet you actually touched me.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.900
That is some jutsu.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.100
Damn it! It didn't work?!

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.700
No, it didn't.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.600
Sasuke's dead.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.530
No way! Chakra like this...

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.270
Liger Bomb!

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.400
It's over.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.170
So that's the Raikage's ninja taijutsu.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.130
Sasuke couldn't have survived that.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.200
We didn't need reinforcements.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:02.770
Huh?

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.970
So that's the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.770
Shee, you okay?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.330
Darui...did you settle your fight?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.830
Maybe.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.830
No one's ever lived through that Liger Bomb, until now.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.630
Those bones and stuff... What is he anyway?

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.270
I fell for his genjutsu and lost.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.330
I still don't have full control of my body.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.000
Geniuses like him appear once in a while.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.330
Sasuke Uchiha... He's a stubborn one!

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.930
Reinforcements?!

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.700
Hey Shee... The Uchiha's eye...

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.630
Doesn't it seem a bit different from before?

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.800
Mangekyo Sharingan?!

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.100
I get it. That's what made Lord Raikage activate that much.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.900
He intends to counter with his Teleportation Jutsu.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.730
Maybe I'm too weak against the Lightning Style.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.230
My body's too numb and can't liquefy properly.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.200
Raikage's chakra has grown enormous.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.230
He's at Tailed Beast levels!

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.500
Come on, brat!

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.730
Amaterasu!

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.400
Put out the fire!

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.470
It's not ordinary fire! Don't get close to it!

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.400
Amaterasu, which ignites anything in its line of sight.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.600
So this is it.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.770
Lateral Bolt of Pain!

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.670
Way to go! A shield of Black Flames!

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.400
Nothing can match the Raikage's teleportation speed.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.830
If you can't keep up visually, then use a shield that can't be touched!

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.530
Now, he won't be able to carelessly attack Sasuke.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.400
He's manipulating the Black Flames?!

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.270
He can even change their chakra form!

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.330
Don't tell me he's more proficient with the Black Flames than Itachi?

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.630
Don't underestimate the Raikage!

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.200
Lord Raikage! Impossible...

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.600
He's sacrificing his left arm.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.270
You're finished!

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.400
Guillotine Drop!

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.330
Inferno Style: Flame Control!

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.630
He's still in the air!

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.600
Sasuke!

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.470
Sand!

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.670
This is...

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.570
Gaara of the Sand.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.700
Wind Scythe Jutsu!

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.230
So these are the flames that never burn out, Amaterasu, huh?

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.730
You Samurai, get back.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.170
This is a problem for the ninja world.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.500
There is no need for Samurai to become casualties.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.400
Th-Thank you, Lord Kazekage.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.400
What's going on?

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.770
Why did you interfere, Kazekage?!

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.330
Whether I punish you or not depends on your answer!

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.270
If you had continued and performed another attack,

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.230
the Black Flames would have further injured you.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.670
Besides, I wish to speak to Sasuke Uchiha.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.530
Boss!

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.930
Shee, hurry and stop the bleeding!

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.970
I'm going to attack Sasuke the minute you're done.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.800
Yes sir!

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.200
Sasuke was able to lay a hand on Lord Raikage,

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.970
who was clad in his Lightning Style armor.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.000
And he's still alive despite two heavy attacks.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.270
Amaterasu in his left eye.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.300
And in his right eye,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.630
he has the ability to change the chakra form of Amaterasu's Black Flames,

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.170
there's no mistake.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.970
Perhaps Sasuke captured Bee after all.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.070
Does that mean there's still progress occurring in the ninja world?

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.500
Your eyes are still as they were in the past.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:29.230
I once told you that you have eyes like mine.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.770
Eyes that seek strength.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.430
Eyes overflowing with hate and a hunger for blood.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:40.800
Eyes itching to kill the one who threw you into the hell called solitude.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.170
Making revenge your sustenance resolves nothing.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.130
I learned that lesson personally.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.830
It's not too late for you.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.630
Do not cast yourself into a world where you are all alone, obsessed with hate.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.430
You won't be able to return.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.630
And if I returned? What would I find there?

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:10.070
Forget it, Gaara.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.930
Naruto already failed at convincing him.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.730
He's just a criminal now,

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.830
who has fallen to the level of the Akatsuki.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.100
He's not like you.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.430
Besides, neither the Raikage nor the others

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.330
who have been victimized by the Akatsuki will remain silent.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.170
After attacking the Five Kage Summit, he's now wanted internationally.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.170
This guy has no future.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.430
Sasuke, you and I are alike.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.700
We've both walked through the darkness of this world.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.130
That's why you should be able to see even the faintest glimmer of light.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.170
In the past and even now.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.700
I closed my eyes long ago.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.530
My goals exist only in the darkness.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.670
Leave your personal feelings out of this.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.270
You are the Kazekage.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.400
Gaara...

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.230
I know.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.500
I understand.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:31.870
Naruto...

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.370
You will probably end up fighting Sasuke one day.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.370
Rather...I will throw Sasuke at you.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.000
A battle that was predestined ages ago.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.170
I'll have Sasuke validate the existence of the Uchiha.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.730
Sasuke isn't your toy!

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.300
Quit making selfish plans!

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.370
You think you can make Sasuke have a change of heart,

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.930
like you did with Nagato?

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.300
That's just as selfish, Naruto.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:06.100
Controlling people requires the skill to manipulate the darkness in their souls.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.730
Although, Nagato just happened to be easily influenced by others.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.170
Don't liken Nagato to yourself!

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.430
His ways were different, but he truly wished for peace!

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.270
But you're different!

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.300
You're right.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.170
The existence of the Uchiha...

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:35.570
If that's all you want to validate, why hunt the Tailed Beasts?

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.170
Just what is your goal?

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.900
What do you hope to accomplish?

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.630
Let's see...

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.700
If anything, it's to become complete.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.330
Complete?!

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.200
What do you mean?!

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.330
Talking to you is meaningless.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.800
I'll explain more in an appropriate place.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.030
Our conversation...was quite fun.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.170
So long.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.230
Sasuke...

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.670
I'm impressed that you can guard against my Inferno Style so effectively.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.730
Your Ultimate Defense is in good shape.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.330
A-Amazing.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.270
Found them! Danzo's among them!

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.130
I must notify Sasuke immediately!

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.600
But...there's powerful chakra all around.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.100
So there's a Sensory-Type after all.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.600
It seems the enemy has a Sensory-Type ninja.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.700
They may come here in time.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.170
What do we do?

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.070
Nothing for now.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.800
When they arrive, we'll slip out during the chaos.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.970
Stop whispering over there!

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.770
Sorry, but I'm a Sensory-Type too.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.170
I'm fully aware that the enemy is on to us.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.100
But you are not to make a move.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.000
We'll deal with the enemy.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.770
It seems this summit is about to become very interesting.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.270
Are you done yet, Shee?!

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.900
Just a little longer.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.930
Comrades of the Hidden Sand!

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.430
I will fire the first shot!

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.070
Press ahead after me!

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.100
Right!

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.330
Gale Style: Laser Circus!

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.770
Secret Red Move: Puppet Triad!

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.670
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.730
Sand Shower Barrage!

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.100
Sasuke!

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.870
W-What is this?!

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.230
Gaara... This is even greater than your Ultimate Defense.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.430
Did he use that to guard against my attacks?

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.500
This chakra... It's the same as that genjutsu earlier.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.530
This doesn't look good.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.530
Was this what he wanted to test?

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.300
This chakra... He's no longer the old Sasuke.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.730
It's too cold.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.630
What is that?

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.370
The power...of darkness?

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.300
A power that only those

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.100
who have awakened the Mangekyo in both eyes can achieve.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.800
This is the third power...

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.500
Susano'o.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.170
When I look at you closely,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.370
you of the Uchiha Clan are quite handsome.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.670
Don't interfere!

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.100
Such a fine man. What a waste.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.700
I'll at least give you a kiss that will make you melt.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.070
Lady Mizukage is intent on fighting!

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.270
Lord Tsuchikage, if you're not going to participate,

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.500
please keep your head lowered.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.100
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Power of the Five Kage"

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.430
Feel free to rampage as you please.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.930
Tune in again!
