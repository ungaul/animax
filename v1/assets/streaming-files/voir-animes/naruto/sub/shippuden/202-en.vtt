WEBVTT

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.550
Stop! Why would you do this?

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.380
Let's test these outside, shall we?

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.340
These eyes…

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.470
see the darkness quite well…

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.180
I wonder if Sasuke and Karin are okay?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.470
I wouldn't waste time thinking about that.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.220
Why?

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.510
Say that Karin and Sasuke are alive and well…

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.880
And you and I find them.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.180
Do you really think it'll be a touching emotional reunion?

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.130
See… Karin wants to get hot and heavy with Sasuke.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.430
Which means the two of us will be in the way.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.510
I see… So what'll we do?

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.470
Keep gathering blades?

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.340
We'll meddle, of course!

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.130
That's what I enjoy most, next to gathering swords.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.430
So we're going to look for Sasuke and Karin?

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.800
First, let's go check out Orochimaru's hideout!

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.990
Four Tails, the King of Sage Monkeys

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.240
You came, Kakashi Sensei! Bushier Brow Sensei!

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.530
You know I can't just sit back and relax

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.780
while my student from Team 7 is working hard!

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.530
Oh! Him! He's got a Sharingan

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.410
and a Rinnegan that are linked, left eye to right eye…and…!

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.410
And there's a rod sticking out of the left side of the chest…and…!

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.950
Calm down. You're not making sense.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.120
The right eye is Sharingan.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.580
The left eye is Rinnegan.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.330
And he has the same rod Pain had in his left chest.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.830
So I see.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.280
Gotta hand it to you, Kakashi.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.120
Your skills of deduction are impressive!

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.330
Here it comes!

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.200
From the number of tails… It's Five Tails!

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.580
Leaf Rock Crush!

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.870
Hey, thanks!

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.740
He's after the Eight Tails!

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.120
Sorry, Eight-o! You okay?

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.410
We share pain, remember?

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.410
What about you? You okay, Bee?

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.370
He tried to attack him?

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.830
So painful…!

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.280
Huh?!

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.280
How can I let a bastard like him do this to me…?

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.450
Why you…!

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.200
There! He did it!

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
Why would he suppress the Tailed Beast's powers?

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.700
I don't know…

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.950
He doesn't seem to have the Tailed Beast

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.990
completely under his control.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.780
Maybe that's why…

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.160
Hey, did you hear that voice, Naruto?

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.830
I heard it.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.530
That was the Tailed Beast… Five Tails' voice.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.660
We Tailed Beasts have emotions.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.830
It pisses me off to see one of my kind treated like that!

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.990
Ouch!

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.660
Now you get mad?

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.200
It's always been the same with every shinobi

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.200
who has kept us as pets!

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.870
Eight Tails…you and that brat Bee are a special exception.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.370
I wonder about that Nine Tails…

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.780
Huh?

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.160
Nine Tails can talk to Eight Tails?

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.780
I know all about it, Nine Tails.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.780
– You… – You talk too much!

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.830
By the way, Eight Tails,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.410
given the number of tails you have,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.240
aren't you the next most powerful after me?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.660
Hurry up and finish this!

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.410
I'm going to take a nap!

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.780
Don't decide who's stronger based on the tail count!

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.910
You've always been like this!

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.240
That's why that Tanuki One Tail really hates you!

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.280
Are you even listening, you fool?!

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.200
Don't you dare play possum, you fox!

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.030
Eight Tails and Nine Tails are arguing…

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.160
Through telepathy the Tailed Beasts speak…

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.700
It's not only rare, but an amazing feat!

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.780
What're you mumbling about, Naruto?!

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.580
The enemy's approaching!

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.780
Just because I'm here doesn't mean you can breathe easy!

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.830
Right!

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.370
We need to confirm which one is going to use

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.410
which one of Pain's jutsu!

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.950
Got it, Guy?

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.450
I'm not good at remembering faces…

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.780
And they all look the same to me…

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.240
Lightning Blade!

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.370
Eight Inner Gates!

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.240
Sixth Gate of Joy, Open!

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.410
Three are headed your way, Naruto!

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.280
They're here!

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.580
Three is better than what we faced before…

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.870
I'm serious now too, hard core!

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.280
Chakra Absorption…

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.950
Summoning… Magnetic Pull and Repulsion…

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.280
Chakra Extraction… Puppetry… What's going on?

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.870
They're not using any of those!

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:55.870
Why?!

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.740
They're not using any of Pain's jutsu!

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.910
Maybe…they can't.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.370
Maybe he's shrewd enough not to waste any chakra

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.450
on Pain's jutsu since we already know how to counter them!

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.330
Yeah. In order to control six Tailed Beasts

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.120
with just his Visual Prowess,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.200
he must use an enormous amount of chakra.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.160
Gotta hand it to you, Kakashi Sensei!

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.410
There's your deductive skill again!

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.240
Kakashi Hatake…

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.410
He's got very discerning eyes.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.370
Well then… I'll just power it up a little.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.490
Next up, two beasts.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.450
Damn it, I'll have to use Nine Tails'

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.240
Chakra Shadow Clones to create a diversion…

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.530
and attack the masked guy head on!

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.530
You can't use any more Nine Tails' chakra

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.580
for Shadow Clones!

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.080
Nine Tails will take your own chakra…

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.580
And you'll drop dead Then you'll be seeing red!

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.240
Bee, haven't you noticed yet?

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.410
I thought you bumped fists with him!

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.200
Given the number of clones he's already produced,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.080
Naruto should have been half-dead a while back.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.200
Seeing as he's not means that Nine Tails stopped taking

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.200
Naruto's chakra sometime ago.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.410
Right, Nine Tails?

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.780
Although I don't know what happened between you two…

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.120
You know, Nine Tails…

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.700
I'm coming after all that hate inside you, too, some day!

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.280
Who the hell are you to decide…

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.830
that having a Tailed Beast inside me makes me unhappy?!

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.330
What the heck is that?!

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.330
Whatever you do, don't let it touch you, Guy!

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.660
Naruto!

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:15.910
We gotta help him!

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.280
Guy, we have to deal with this side first!

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.370
This is bad too!

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.620
We're being surrounded!

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.370
The tree wilted instantly!

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.200
Is it a corrosive gas?

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.160
I'm worried about how much chakra I have left,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200
but I have no choice.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.240
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.780
Guy… We have to guard each other's back

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.950
and focus only on what's in front of us.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.200
Any complaints?!
Nope!

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.030
Lightning Cable!

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.990
Sixth Gate of Joy, Open!

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.780
Asakujaku!

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.410
Here comes the next wave!

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.410
Same here!

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.490
Let's wrap this up and help Naruto!

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.950
Let Naruto go, you monkey!

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.280
Nine Tails… I think you gave some of your chakra

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.950
to the Naruto's clone who was fighting the other Madara.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.080
You should lend this one strength too before it's too late.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.490
I'm not like you, Eight Tails.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:03.280
I won't wag my tails each and every time for my Jinchuriki…

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.780
Don't you care what happens to Naruto?!

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.370
Nine Tails…

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.240
This transient form is nothing more than a nodule.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.280
You're only a piece of yourself.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.330
Shut up.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.660
You are just an ignorant unstable power…

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.620
Shut up.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.370
Those who shall guide you are the Uchiha.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.990
You Tailed Beasts are simply servants

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.200
of those with Visual Prowess!

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.660
Shut the hell up!

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.330
Obey!

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.120
Nine Tails…

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.740
Your power is too great.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.370
Regrettably, I cannot let you run loose.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.740
No matter what words they use…

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.200
When you exert your power, you draw hatred to you.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.160
Please stay quiet inside me.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.490
Humans all say…

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.990
This is unfortunate for both of us…

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.030
You may be here to keep the world in check,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.280
but I'm here to watch you.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.580
…the same thing.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.200
And now, it's this brat?

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.660
How dare these shinobi…

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.030
I'll bet even he…

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.200
You know, Nine Tails…

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:50.530
I'm coming after all that hate inside you, too, some day!

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:12.990
Naruto!

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.920
What the—?!

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.580
Now you want to take my power too?

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.410
Coming all the way in here… you obnoxious brat!

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.080
A-Are you…

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.530
Four Tails?!

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.780
Don't call me "Four Tails"!

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.660
I have a proper name!

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.530
I am the handsome Monkey King of Suirendo,

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.200
the King of Sage Monkeys,

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.370
bestowed with the priestly title "Son"

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.280
from the Sage of Six Paths!

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.660
The Great Monkey Equal of Heaven, Son Goku!

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.780
Huh? Uh… Which one's your name?

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.280
It's Son Goku!

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.620
You humans are all stupid!

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.830
You can't even get a name straight!

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.450
You are all lesser than apes.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.490
I don't want to give my power to likes of such…

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.080
So where are we?

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.490
It sorta looks like Nine Tails' place…

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.120
Did you hear me, kid?!

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.410
I told you my name! Don't you dare ignore me!

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.200
You're so rude!

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.780
Huh? Oh…

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.870
S-Sorry.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.870
You're…pretty genuine for a human.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.200
It's the first time I've heard

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.120
someone apologize to a Tailed Beast.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.740
I guess you didn't come to steal my power, eh?

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.120
You have one inside you too…

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.700
That's how you got in…

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.580
Kurama's trained his Jinchuriki well.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.410
Kurama?

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.240
Who's Kurama?

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.240
How can you be the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.330
and not even know his real name?!

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.870
That's why humans disgust me!

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.200
Huh?! The Nine Tails has a name too?!

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.410
I see, his name's Kurama!

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.370
You humans only see us as sources of power.

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.330
You don't even care if we have names,

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:21.660
or care to know them.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.990
You imprison and deny us of our existence.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.120
Look, it's that boy.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.240
Ignore him and keep walking.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.740
Who's that boy?

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.330
You don't need to know.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.870
What the—?!

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.030
That brat!

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.120
I think I understand a little about how you feel.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.490
I used to misbehave a lot.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:13.780
I just wanted to be scolded.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.660
Huh?

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.780
I'd do anything to get people to notice me.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:24.030
It was better than being invisible.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.370
I'm a Jinchuriki…

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.080
But I have a proper name I cherish…Naruto.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.990
It's a memento from my parents and master.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.160
That's why…

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.950
I'm nobody. I don't want to be anybody.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.580
I just want to fulfill Project Tsuki no Me.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.330
I can't stand a guy like that who doesn't even care who he is…

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.950
It's not worth living in this world where only despair exists.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.450
...is forcing you to do whatever he wants.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.410
Well then, what do you want to do with us?

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.700
Like Octopops…

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.080
I'd like to be like Octopops and Eight Tails.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.330
Huh?

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.780
When I watch him joke around with Eight Tails,

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.450
and fight, and console each other…

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.280
They're like friends.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.700
And I always have this feeling…

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.740
I… I really envy them.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.200
Aw c'mon! Don't tell me…

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.700
A human like you seriously wants to be friends

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.280
with a Tailed Beast?!

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.450
Huh?

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.780
This guy…

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.700
He's dead serious…

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.780
That's why I want to help you too… Umm…

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.580
What was your name again?

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.530
Just call me Son…

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.580
By the way, I ate you. What're you gonna do?

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.950
Oh, yeah! What'll I do?!

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.330
Hmmm…

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.200
He seems better than the guy in the mask…

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.330
There is a way to stop me.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:54.240
Undo these chains and you'll see.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.240
Son!

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.620
I don't trust Jinchuriki on principle.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.280
Especially fools who that claim

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.410
they want to be friends with Tailed Beasts.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.280
You really think that if you set me free,

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.240
I will be your ally?

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.490
That's a response to be expected…

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.330
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Nine Tails"

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.370
Humans just want to imprison us!

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:09.240
NINE TAILS Tune in again!
