WEBVTT

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.200
That's the Ten Tails'... Jinchuriki!

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.910
The Ten Tails' Jinchuriki

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.610
The Ten Tails disappeared?

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700
What's going on? Did they defeat it?

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.740
No...

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.700
Hinata! Did you see it?

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.040
Yeah!

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.840
Can you explain what happened?

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.040
Ten Tails was completely absorbed into that man.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.250
Based on looking at its chakra.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.540
Don't tell me...

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.340
That's the Ten Tails'...

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.090
Jinchuriki?

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.090
What is this?!

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.290
This is bad. Jinchuriki, huh?

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.500
He looks even creepier than before!

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.340
Obito...

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.670
Naruto... How can you tell he's a Jinchuriki?

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.710
I've become friends with the Tailed Beasts.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.540
They gave me some of their chakra earlier,

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.420
so it's obvious to me.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.340
I could sense the Tailed Beasts' chakra getting sucked into Obito

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.960
one after the other.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.630
Plus, I've seen Nagato do that Six Paths Rebirth Jutsu before.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.130
But the signs he was weaving were completely different!

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.960
Anyway, he was performing the jutsu

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.040
to become a Jinchuriki all this time.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.540
I see...

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.590
Eight-o! Is that the final form?

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.420
No, it's not.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.340
It's hard to explain, but that isn't it.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.250
Looks like Ten Tails was used to create a Jinchuriki

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.130
before it reached its final form.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.000
Even if you have become a Jinchuriki,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.340
the Gracious Deity Gates are still in play.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.670
Whoa! Amazing!

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.540
No...

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.880
The Sage Art Seal that suppressed the Ten Tails was...

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.670
Such power...

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.420
What?!

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.420
Impossible!

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.380
The Four Crimson Rays Formation!

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.880
Is it just me,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.460
or is he stronger than when he was gigantic?

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.170
Before, it was just throwing its power around.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.710
But now, it's learned to focus it.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.210
Everyone, keep your guard up!

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.790
We don't know what that man,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.420
who made the Ten Tails' power his own, might do!

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.420
He's broken the barrier!

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.040
Enough! Obito, stop this!

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.500
O...bi...to?

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.170
I'll be blunt. This guy is stronger than me!

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.590
No offense, but it appears so.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.290
Even if you reabsorb your remaining clones,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.880
you're no match, Elder Brother!

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.170
I know.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.290
However...

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.210
It would be fun to watch all the Hokage beg for mercy,

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.420
but I cannot wait any longer.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.920
Obito is now just like the Sage of Six Paths.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.500
I can't let him take the lead before I use my trump card.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.460
What's happened?

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.500
He's so fast!

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.460
Saru! Fourth! Scram!

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.040
This is Lord Second's attack plan!

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.420
– Elder Brother! – Mm-hmm!

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.170
EXPLODE

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.880
Minato, get away!

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.210
Lord Second, you sure work fast!

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.960
Flying Raijin Jutsu!

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.090
I suspected that might not be enough to kill you...

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.670
I created the Reanimation Jutsu,

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.590
as well as ancillary jutsu to go with it.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.290
Though this is the first time I'm using it on myself.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.040
There it is! The Lord Second's special...

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.130
Tandem Explosive Tags!

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.540
This is how it's done!

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.590
Each tag summons more tags, resulting in continuous explosions.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.290
Concentrated and focused consecutive explosions!

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.420
This is too much! What's going on? I can't keep up!

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.750
Don't freak out!

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.590
Always keep one eye on what's happening around you!

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.670
I don't care if that is the Jinchuriki of the Ten Tails!

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.380
The Lords Hokage are engaged in battle!

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.460
We have to join them!

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.590
Don't be hasty! We need to—!

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.750
All of you! You must not approach heedlessly!

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.500
What is he?

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.500
He's solid and swift.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.670
And he has an attack that turns all to dust in an instant!

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.920
Shuriken Shadow Clones!

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.500
It's similar to Ohnoki's Particle Style, but its shape is fluid.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.000
It can shift to be either offensive or defensive.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.550
And can be continuously maintained.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.380
I suspect it's a combination of more than four Changes in Chakra Nature!

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.920
This is more than a Kekkei Genkai or even a Kekkei Touta...

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.210
But there seems to be a time limit to how long

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.960
he can use each Change in Chakra Form.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.550
Gramps!

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:13.960
Dad! You couldn't teleport Grandpa Third with your jutsu too?

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.050
It's impossible. I can't teleport anything that I myself,

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.550
or my chakra isn't touching directly.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.420
Calm down, Naruto.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.500
The Hokage are Reanimations.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.420
They intentionally attacked head-on knowing that they won't die,

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.420
in order to check out the enemy's moves and abilities.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.420
Stop worrying and analyze the battle instead.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.210
So that's Sasuke... He's extremely smart.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.380
Although it still takes a while for a Reanimation to regenerate.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.380
I'll go first and create an opening!

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.420
At this point, I feel the need to...

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.630
I'm done waiting, Hashirama!

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.960
W-What's going on?

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.460
I get it...

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.090
Ten Tails hasn't completely synched with its Jinchuriki yet.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.460
This is our chance to take it down!

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.750
I'll summon my original here then!

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.630
It's been a while, but it's time

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.960
for my Rasen-Flash Super-Circle Dance Howl Stage Three!

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.380
Gamakichi! Below you!

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.800
He passed underground! It's just his upper body!

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.460
Damn it!

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.090
Sasuke...

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.090
You're not the one...

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.050
...who's going to sever the past. I am!

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.210
I hope this makes it in time!

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.840
Flying Raijin Jutsu!

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.050
My markings on Obito disappeared?

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:24.800
Damn it!

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.340
Owww... I thought we were going to die!

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.210
I can't teleport anything that I myself,

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.210
or my chakra isn't touching directly.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.050
Looks like my boy is as accomplished as Sasuke.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.960
Now then...

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.630
He's just like a snake.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.630
What is that?

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.590
We have to take him down

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.750
while he's still unable to use his body well.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.960
Was he after your clone just now, Dad?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.840
No, I don't think that was it...

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.550
What? What happened?!

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.590
He hit himself with his own attack.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.840
His attack missed.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.800
Seems Obito's consciousness is merely clinging

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.000
to Ten Tail's great power.

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:28.920
He barely has any control over it.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.670
I'm glad he missed us,

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.050
because if it hit us, we'd be dead!

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.460
We can't approach him carelessly.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.630
This time, I'll get

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.920
the Rasen-Flash Super-Circle Dance Howl Stage Three in for sure!

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.750
I'll create an opening,

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.050
so you two hit him immediately with your strongest combo!

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.340
Rin...

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.170
Of course, I'm going to be the Hokage!

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.670
Rin!

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.250
And then... I won't have any time for girls!

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.090
Right, Sensei?

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.090
Here I come, Obito!

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.960
Who...are...you?

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.960
Finally, Sensei...

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.670
Damn it!

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.340
Dad!

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.880
Naruto, focus!

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.300
He got me, but I'm okay!

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.590
I used Flying Raijin to escape.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.050
Are you sure about that?

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.500
When did he...?!

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.500
I see! He attached it to me so it would teleport along with me!

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.030
Even a small power can be helpful,

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.820
because there may come a time when it will be needed.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.570
It all depends on how it's used.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.030
Our power could change the course of this world.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.900
We can't afford to relax and let our guard down

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.530
even for one second!

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.990
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "An Opening"

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.150
Shikamaru, you would make a great Hokage.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:08.820
AN OPENING Tune in again!
