WEBVTT

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.170
Where'd he go?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.400
I'm adapting to the power.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.330
It feels good. This isn't bad.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.700
I think I'll stir things up a little.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.670
Storage

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.530
What are you waiting for?

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.030
Press the Storing Square!

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.570
You’re unsure, right, Naruto?

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.430
I can’t say that I blame you.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.000
What do you mean?

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.470
Lord Fukasaku…

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.630
The Nine Tails gets its power by merging its chakra with its will.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.270
CHAKRA WILL To control this power,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.130
CHAKRA WILL you must isolate only the Nine Tails' chakra,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.770
CHAKRA WILL assimilate it into your own chakra and make it your own power.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.930
But it's easier said than done.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.430
If you pull out the Nine Tails' chakra, you also draw out its will.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.600
The Nine Tails' will is a mass of hatred that binds itself tightly to chakra.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.200
No matter how hard you try to shield yourself,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.200
it will find some hatred that you have buried deep inside

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.870
and it will try to overtake you.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.670
In other words,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.370
CHAKRA WILL controlling the Nine Tails' power means taking its will and its chakra

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.630
and completely separating the two with your own strong will

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.170
which should harbor no hatred.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.570
The Fourth Hokage made the Nine Tails' seal in a way

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.370
that allows a small amount of its chakra to leak out of the cage

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.770
in hopes that it would naturally become one with Naruto’s own chakra.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.730
It is known as the Eight Trigram Sealing Formula and

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.630
it creates a double-interface Tetragram Seal.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.500
But if this key is used to open the Tetragram Seal,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.070
you could pull out all of the Nine Tails’ chakra!

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.830
And that means all of the Nine Tails' will

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.630
would tag along with all of its chakra!

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.800
And as soon as Naruto’s will loses to the Nine Tails’ will….

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.530
The Nine Tails will be completely resurrected!

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.130
How terrible.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.000
And has the key ever been used?

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.100
A while ago, the Tetragram Seal was weakening.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.200
So in order to control Naruto,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.670
who was starting to transform into the Nine Tails during training,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.030
Jiraiya used the key to tighten the seal on him.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.430
This should hold for a while.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.300
Just a while, huh?

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.300
What's the matter, Pervy Sage?

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.330
Jiraiya was greatly concerned.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.570
If the Fourth Hokage's Sealing Formula was beginning to weaken,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.470
there was no telling when Naruto would transform into the Nine Tails again.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.470
I guess I'll try it.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.230
Huh?!

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.630
A toad came out of your mouth!

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.630
Don't be so hard on me, Jiraiya!

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.270
You just summoned me a while ago.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.770
I need a favor. Will you hear me out, Gerotora?

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.170
It's Naruto's Tetragram Seal.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.000
Hey hey… You just tightened the seal.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.230
Do you want it tighter?

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.770
No, the reverse.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.830
I want to loosen it just a little bit.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.170
Wha—?!

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.730
Jiraiya wanted the seal to be opened deliberately for just a short while

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.600
in order to drill Naruto into developing the power to resist the Nine Tails' will.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.430
But it didn't work.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.430
I didn't mean to hurt Pervy Sage.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.300
What? Giving up already.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.530
This training…is impossible.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.930
I'm disappointed in you. Calling it quits so soon.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.330
Remember when I told you that you reminded me of the Fourth Hokage?

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.530
You are the shinobi who inherited the Rasengan,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.770
the jutsu developed by the Fourth Hokage himself.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.870
You need to shape up!

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.700
You don’t know how happy I was

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.530
when I learned the Rasengan, the Fourth Hokage's jutsu.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.370
I had taken over the Fourth Hokage's jutsu,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.000
which was my dream…my goal.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.900
But…

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.870
Compared to the time when I was learning the Rasengan,

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.700
this training means nothing.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.900
I guess mastering the Rasengan was a miracle for you.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.770
Maybe I was expecting too much.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:34.100
Sure, I know what a great shinobi the Fourth Hokage was.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.930
That’s for sure.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.430
He's totally different than someone like you,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.900
who gets so excited about mastering one measly jutsu.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.130
Unlike you, my foolish apprentice, he was a true prodigy.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.500
And the jutsu he developed was extraordinary.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.270
Even I couldn't grasp the ninjutsu he developed.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.330
Even you, Pervy Sage?

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.100
And not even the successive Hokage.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.570
His jutsu was that extraordinary?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.570
I knew it. Becoming the Hokage is impossible.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.400
But there is just one shinobi

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.530
with the potential to master such an extraordinary jutsu.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.730
That is you, Naruto!

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.930
Me?

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.270
Yes.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.470
You possess the Nine Tails' chakra and only you can master that jutsu.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.030
A jutsu that only I can grasp?

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.570
Is that…

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.030
That's right.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.500
The Fourth Hokage left it solely for your sake.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.070
It is his legacy to you.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.500
The Fourth Hokage's legacy?

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.100
And it's just for me?

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.800
Naruto!

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.970
Will you undergo training to gain mastery over your chakra control?

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.900
Yes!

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.900
The harder I try to become strong,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.330
the tighter the grip of the Nine Tails' will becomes.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.830
He totally ignores my will and tries to hurt everyone in my path.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.600
That was the result of opening Naruto's key just a tiny bit.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.530
So that's the reason for the scar on Jiraiya-boy’s chest.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.530
And then what happened?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.570
Nothing good.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.170
Long ago, when I fought Orochimaru,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.230
I relied on the Nine Tails' power and relinquished my will.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.530
Don’t talk about Sasuke, in front of me,

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.270
like he belongs to you!

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.630
Hearing about Sasuke made me angry.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.630
Before I knew it, I lost myself.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.500
Captain Yamato told me not to rely on the Nine Tails' chakra

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.500
and to use my own strength to fight.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.400
Everything is fine during training with Captain Yamato,

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.830
since he can restrain Jinchuriki.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.400
But during a fight, feelings of hate are bound to creep up.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.230
So I figured, I’d forget about using the Nine Tails' power.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.700
If I can't suppress the Nine Tails' will with my own…

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.200
I don't need a power that hurts people

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.770
like the Pervy Sage and Sakura.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.230
I had my mind made up.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200
But…

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.800
When Hinata got hurt by Pain…

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.100
I was so mad and bitter.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.600
Rather than not using it…

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.130
My heart latched onto the Nine Tails' will on its own.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:02.130
Right now, I feel safe, since Fourth Hokage's seal has been tightened.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.170
But it might act up again at anytime.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.900
Yet in order to fight Sasuke,

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.170
I have to use the Nine Tails' chakra.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.470
I'm the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki, after all.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.570
I can't hide from that forever.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.300
I sealed half of the Nine Tails' chakra inside of you,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.200
because I believed you could control its power.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.630
Right, Dad?

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.130
Hurting my friends…

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.530
Giving in to hatred…

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.700
It's no use getting hesitant.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.270
I understand now just how dangerous it is to release the Nine Tails' chakra.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.700
But he has the Fourth Hokage's love

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.730
and that sheer gutsiness that Jiraiya instilled in him.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.200
Contract complete. I'm going into storage!

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.270
Huh? Going into storage?

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.130
You don't need to do a thing. Just keep your mouth open.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.930
Mouth?

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.270
Yes. Now say “ahh.”

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.070
Wider.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.530
Here I go…into storage.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.530
Hey! Open wider!

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.730
Are you going to let me go into storage?!

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.800
Why through my mouth?!

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.730
It's slimy and feels awful.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.330
Okay, storage complete!

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.470
I'm taking you back to Hidden Leaf Village!

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.070
After that, we'll have to look for the octopus.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.600
Oh, right… You prophesied that I would encounter an octopus.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.330
Where is this octopus? Can't you give more clues?

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.070
It’s not clear, but it's a solitary island.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.770
People don't go near it.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.570
It's like a paradise for creatures.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.900
To me, it seems it would be a fun resort.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.830
And there, the octopus should be of help to you.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.070
In any case, you will find your way.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.370
Right!

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.530
There’s no mistake, it’s Kabuto’s doing.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.600
This method of killing…

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.830
Kabuto is becoming more like Orochimaru.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.030
But why would he leave a trail like this?

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.970
He would… Is this deliberate?

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.770
What does he intend to do?

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.830
No doubt Kabuto is carrying on Orochimaru's will.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.900
Now, is he going after the Hidden Leaf or the Akatsuki?

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.900
Let’s start with the greetings, shall we, Tobi?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.770
No…

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.770
You call yourself Madara now.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.070
You did well to find this place.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.130
I roamed from country to country as a spy

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.570
and I once belonged to the Akatsuki.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.770
Don't underestimate my intel network.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.970
You were once one of Sasori's spies.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.630
You are a traitor to the Akatsuki.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.600
This is…

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.930
Reanimation Jutsu.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:09.230
The Forbidden Jutsu known only to the Second Hokage and Lord Orochimaru.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.730
Now, I'm the third one.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.400
And I have surpassed the previous two.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.430
This performance is dedicated to you.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.830
So that you would believe in my power and trust in me.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.130
Rest assured.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.800
I did not come here to fight.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.870
What do you want?

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.600
I want us to join forces.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.870
Join forces?

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.670
How will that benefit me?

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.000
I understand you intend to start a war soon.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.130
I'm offering to provide more military might.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.870
With these here… Itachi.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.330
Sasori.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.300
Deidara.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.130
Kakuzu.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.800
And Nagato.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.170
They each have formidable strength.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.230
And I have even more up my sleeve.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.630
And in exchange?

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.370
Sasuke Uchiha.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.770
What are you plotting?

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:18.100
Nothing really.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.930
I am only interested in the pure truth behind ninjutsu.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.530
And I need Sasuke to pursue this.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.400
I need a young, live, sensitive Uchiha.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.730
And if I refuse?

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.270
Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.900
Th-This is…

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.570
Surely, you didn't think that I would come unprepared.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.270
Yes. You can’t refuse.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.230
Why you… Where did you get that?

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.370
I have my means.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.430
Don't worry. I haven't told anyone about this.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.230
What's so funny?

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.270
Kabuto Yakushi.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.930
Never did I imagine that you would come this far.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.270
Arguing with you now will only weaken our side.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.130
You came here, waiting for the perfect opportunity.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.170
You are very careful indeed.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.000
What do you mean?

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.700
So be it. We will join forces with you.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.530
But only on the condition that I hand Sasuke over to you

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.170
after victory in this war is assured.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.900
You will not be allowed to see Sasuke until then.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.730
You understand things clearly.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.200
I expected no less from Madara Uchiha.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.530
Your vessel is unique.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.730
And you are insolent.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.030
I’ll reformulate my strategy after I confirm your battle strength.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.900
Follow me.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.800
He brought corpses all the way to this desolate place?

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.630
Judging from the way the shinobi's bodies are strewn about,

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.670
I'll bet there's something up ahead.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.930
I originally thought we'd pursue him by way of Hidden Waterfall,

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.870
and back to Hidden Leaf Village.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.600
But it's like he wants us to follow him.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.170
I don't get it.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.830
Is it a trap then?

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.270
What do we do?

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.500
Tokuma! Use your Byakugan towards two o'clock!

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.600
Right!

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.130
Byakugan!

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.470
Captain Mitarashi! This is… What's the matter?

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.200
It's not just Kabuto!

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.600
He's with a masked member of the Akatsuki!

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.470
The two of them are going through some kind of underground entrance!

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.870
What?!

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.670
A masked man?

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.800
Is it the one who calls himself Madara?

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.600
Does this mean we found his hideout?

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.470
What is he doing with Kabuto?

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.100
Have they joined forces?

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:34.130
Did Kabuto purposely lure us here?

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.600
In order to show us Madara's hideout?

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.930
But why? If they’ve joined forces…

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.100
I don't know yet.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.900
But we need to send word to the village immediately!

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.600
Hide them? Naruto and Bee can lend much strength to this battle.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.030
Why hide them away?

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.630
The Five Great Nations joined together and

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.570
our aim in this war is to protect those two.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.400
Your sole dissent as Hokage is not sufficient.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.370
We will decide this with majority rule.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.370
You child! Naruto is—

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.030
I know him quite well.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.670
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Five Kage's Decision"

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:02.900
It’s fine!

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.470
Tune in again!
