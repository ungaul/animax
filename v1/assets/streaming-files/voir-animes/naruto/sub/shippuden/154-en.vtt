WEBVTT

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.630
Before he died, Jiraiya said to me,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.730
"go store yourself inside Naruto."

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.630
Are you crazy?!

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.270
The key that corresponds to Naruto's Eight-Signed Seal

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.270
is transcribed on my belly!

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.730
Each year, the Fourth Hokage's seal weakens!

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.230
The key remains in order to re-seal it

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.970
when it becomes necessary!

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.000
To place such a key right next to the safe is unheard of!

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.730
Still, Minato entrusted it to us.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.970
It was always meant to be returned to Naruto.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.330
It's too soon!

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.430
Once you talked me into loosening the Tetragram Seal…

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.870
You haven't forgotten what the results were, have you?!

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.430
Yeah…

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.100
However, the fact that Minato left me the jutsu for the key

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.670
convinces me that he intended for Naruto

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.800
to perfect that jutsu one day.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200
Great Lord Elder!

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.200
Are you sure this is the right thing?

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.100
Jiraiya claimed that Naruto could completely control

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.270
the power of the Nine-Tails,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.100
but when we tested him, it didn't go well.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.500
But Jiraiya refused to give in,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.200
saying that it was for that purpose that Minato had sealed

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.600
half of the Nine-Tails' chakra inside of Naruto.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.530
Great Lord Elder, Gerotora himself is the key to Naruto's Tetragram Seal.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.570
Is it safe to hand him over to Naruto?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.700
What do you think?

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.030
Have Naruto Uzumaki come here.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.700
I shall do a reading on him.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.400
We will then see what we must do.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.230
Huh? Is that true?

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.300
It hasn't been officially announced yet, but it's clear,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.900
judging from the activity in front of the hut where she was resting.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.570
It seems that all of her attendants, who were all in such low spirits,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.200
have been gathering there smiling!

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.130
I guess their prayers have all been heard.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.700
Please eat more slowly!

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.530
This is not enough!

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.430
My chakra hasn't returned to normal!

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.370
Bring me more food!

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.700
If I'm not careful, I'll become an old hag!

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.200
Uh-oh, no, no!

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.200
The Hokage Quarters' supply stores have run out.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.030
I'll go and requisition more provisions,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.000
so please take a short break.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.170
No! Don't do it! What are you thinking?!

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.800
This one is completely off limits!

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.270
What are you talking about?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.270
Huh?

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.670
K-Kakashi…

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.600
I'm glad to see you so well.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.800
This is nothing, I'm just getting started.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.900
After all you've eaten, it doesn't make any sense.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.970
I am relieved.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.300
I was dangerously close to becoming the Hokage.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.130
But well, I'm not really the Hokage type.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.500
Considering the present situation, we need someone like you,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.970
Lady Tsunade, with wide influence, to be the Hokage.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.500
I must say I am amazed to hear about the Allied Shinobi Force.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.370
And I'm surprised that

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.300
the Tsuchikage and the Raikage agreed to cooperate.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.770
That just goes to prove

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.830
what an awful situation we are faced with.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.900
Madara Uchiha…

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.730
He's really still alive?

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.830
We don't have absolute proof,

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.170
but considering what they are trying to do,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.830
I'd say there's no doubt about it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.330
Another war, huh?

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.130
Who would have thought the karma of the Uchiha

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.100
would engulf all the shinobi in the world.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.730
I will call a meeting immediately after this meal!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.830
We must prepare for war!

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.470
Prophecy of the Great Lord Elder

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.170
You must rest for a while.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.100
It takes some time to become accustomed to the Mangekyo.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.170
Are you in pain?

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.570
No.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.000
It feels right. I can feel Itachi's visual powers.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.900
I can feel myself getting stronger!

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.500
INTEL DIVISION And then, Orochimaru forced me into hard labor.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.470
And then, Orochimaru forced me into hard labor.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.930
And when Sasuke took over

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.630
he kept giving poor old me the most unreasonable demands.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.430
In the end, he treated me like dirt.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.500
I'm a victim too!

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.100
I see. It must have been hard on you!

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.430
Jeez…

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.970
We're not asking about your personal history.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.830
We are asking for intel on the Akatsuki, Sasuke, and Kabuto.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.030
And don't get emotionally involved!

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.470
What good will it do if you get swayed?

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.170
F-Forgive me.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.570
All right. But only if you accept my conditions.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.170
Conditions?!

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.500
First of all… I'm starving!

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.900
If you interrogate someone,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.630
you're supposed to give 'em a fried pork cutlet bowl, right?!

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.200
What do you mean "a fried pork cutlet bowl"?!

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.430
I didn't think there was a fried pork cutlet bowl shop in the village.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.430
Even if there were,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.000
would it still be in business under these circumstances?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.430
I heard that Ichiraku has started up again in temporary quarters.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.730
Would ramen do?

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.500
No way. It has to be a fried pork cutlet bowl.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.900
Then, shall we see if we can get delivery

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.130
from outside the village?

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.900
You can get a fried pork cutlet bowl from a noodle shop too, can't you?

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.130
It would take about two days.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.330
Cripes! What a pair!

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.100
– F-Forgive me. – F-Forgive me.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.630
They're alike.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.330
What is this?

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.400
This village is cheerful… and warm.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.730
Just like him.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.570
Hey, Naruto! Haven't seen you for a while.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.000
Where were you?

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.930
Well…umm… You see…umm…

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.700
It gets lonely when you're not around.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.870
Your liveliness gives the whole village the energy to recover.

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.670
Thank you, thank you.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.500
Oh, man…

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.400
I saw that.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.670
Yeah.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.500
His head is getting big, I tell you.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.100
Just look at him smiling away. It's unpleasant.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.770
– This is a problem. – Thank you, thank you.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.000
We, the mass media, have created a terrible monster.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.970
If we don't take Naruto down a peg or two,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.130
the village is going to suffer.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.430
Yeah.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.730
I wonder where he's trying to go.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.600
Nowhere good, I'm sure.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.230
I've got it! We'll focus in on the decisive moment!

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.030
– Yeah! – Yeah!

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.070
Wait for me, my love! I've been waiting to see you!

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.530
I was right!

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.470
It's them again. Do they think I haven't noticed them?

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.200
They're following me everywhere.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.270
Naruto…

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.230
You're the village hero, Naruto, aren't you?

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.230
Huh?

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.070
No, I'm no hero.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.330
By the way, where are you headed, ey?

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.430
"Ey"?!

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.130
You're Konohamaru, aren't you?!

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.300
I am not Konohamaru, ey!

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.630
Don't lie!

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.230
Why you—!

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.300
What's the big idea?!

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.800
In that case, I'll do this!

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.230
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.030
You can't get away, ey!

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.270
Harem Jutsu!

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.630
– What?! – What?!

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.200
I want a word with the village hero, ey!

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.470
We got a tip that you have a sweetheart, ey!

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.070
– Cripes! – Who is it, ey?

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.700
Aren't you going on a date now, ey?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.770
The village hero, huh?

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.170
But…

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.130
Where are you going, ey?!

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.500
That time, when Naruto stood up to Pain in order to protect me…

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.170
the Nine-Tails appeared in Naruto's body.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.600
That's…

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.230
Do you hate me?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.400
I could feel its intense anger,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.330
but I couldn't feel any of Naruto's will.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:38.230
It was like his anger had taken over his heart.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.070
All because of that Nine-Tails.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.100
Now that the First Hokage's necklace

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.570
that Naruto received from Lady Tsunade is lost,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.100
if the Nine-Tails should ever run loose…

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.970
even I couldn't stop it.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.430
True, it would be tremendously risky

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.670
to take on the Akatsuki with the Nine-Tails inside him.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.270
But…

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.170
– O-Oh no! – Wait up! Naruto, ey!

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.930
He is Naruto.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.800
He's not the Nine-Tails.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.830
For this battle, we don't need the Nine-Tails.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.100
We need Naruto's strength.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.030
If it looks like the Nine-Tails is going to take over,

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.900
we have to stop it.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.100
That's right.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.500
This is also a battle in which

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.800
we must protect Naruto from the Akatsuki and the Nine-Tails.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.430
That's how I…no…

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.670
I'm sure this is how all of my classmates feel.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.500
We will protect Naruto, and we will fight with Naruto.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.000
I wonder what Lady Tsunade thinks.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.330
Is everyone here?

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.870
We shall now start our war council to discuss strategy!

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.900
First, assemble reserves of ninja tools and foodstuffs.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.270
We must divide our shinobi into main battle units and support forces,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.270
and consider how we should build the platoons

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.430
within the fighting forces!

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.000
Bring me the complete list of all our shinobi!

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.630
So it's war. So it's finally come to that.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.700
You were invited to this war council, but you're still young.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.170
Keep your ears open and don't miss a thing.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.430
Yeah. I know that.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.730
I will make full use of my head and hammer everything in!

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.400
I guess I finally lost them.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.900
Now, finally, I can enjoy my love to the fullest!

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.370
Old man! One large tonkotsu miso with BBQ pork!

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.570
Naruto!

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.370
Huh?!

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.270
So Grandma Tsunade is fine now?

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.830
Yes!

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.070
All right!

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.270
Is that right? I'm happy about Lady Tsunade.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.800
Okay! Since this is good news, the ramen is on me!

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.330
Huh?! Are you sure?!

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.330
Why don't you have some too, Sakura?

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.030
No thanks. I still have more people to notify.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.500
Well, I'll see you later, Naruto!

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.830
Now that that's off my mind, I feel hungrier than ever!

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.230
Okay! I'm eating my fill today.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.470
One bowl, two bowls, three bowls!

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.570
Here you go!

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.070
It's a special tonkotsu miso with BBQ pork slices

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.300
to celebrate the Hokage's recovery!

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.970
Whoa!

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.530
Thank you for the…

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:02.970
Oh? He disappeared.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.770
…food!

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.000
I'm surprised he dug right into the food.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.370
Looks like he really loves my bug cooking!

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.400
What am I doing here again?

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.830
I did a Reverse Summoning on you.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.430
The Great Lord Elder will divine your future, Naruto-boy.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:44.730
Divine?

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.270
Follow me.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.470
Don't throw it up!

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.230
I have brought him.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.200
Hey! Long time no see, Giant Gramps Sage!

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:18.770
It was indeed I who summoned you…er…umm…

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.730
Who're you again?

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.430
Naruto Uzumaki!

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.470
I wish you'd hurry up and learn my name, Giant Gramps Sage!

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.500
Oh, that's right, that's right. It's Naruto.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.800
Do we have to go through this every time?

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.170
Listen, Naruto.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.130
I have seen a prophecy involving you.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.400
A prophecy? Okay, I'm ready for it.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.700
In that case, listen carefully.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.600
You will soon be meeting an octopus.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:03.770
An octopus?

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.630
Why an octopus?

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.800
Well, I couldn't see too clearly,

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.100
but I'm sure they were octopus arms.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.570
And then, it will come to pass that

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.570
you will fight a young man whose power lies in his eyes.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.330
And… Yeah… I know.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.630
What do you mean, "you know"?

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.470
I don't plan on changing.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.900
Nor am I interested in understanding you.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.630
And I don't plan on dying!

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.500
You're the one who's going to die!

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.630
If I die, we both die, Sasuke.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.630
Fine then!

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.300
I'll kill you first.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:07.030
It's clear you still haven't acknowledged me yet.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:08.730
Enough, Naruto.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.500
I'll take Sasuke on.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.970
You have your precious dream of becoming the Hokage.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.230
I can't let Sasuke take you down with him.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:21.800
How can I become the Hokage if I can't even save one friend?!

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.900
I'll fight…

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.600
Sasuke!

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.100
So you saw it?

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.970
Yeah.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.870
That young man whose power lies in his eyes…

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.730
Do you know who that is?!

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.130
Yeah, and I've already made up my mind.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.600
Gerotora…

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.870
I also saw a dream where you stored yourself inside Naruto.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.370
W-What?!

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.200
Give him the Fourth Hokage's seal.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.270
I have no choice but to do as you say, Great Lord Elder.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.130
What is this?

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.670
It is the key left by the Fourth Hokage

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.930
that locks and unlocks the sealing jutsu on your belly!

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.070
With this you can let the Nine-Tails run free,

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.270
if that's what you want.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.600
Press on that square area with your hand.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.170
With this, you will have the means to perfect that jutsu

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.570
that Jiraiya was talking about.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.800
The key to release…

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.870
the Nine-Tails' seal.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.770
Are you unsure, Naruto?

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:41.170
In battle, feelings of hatred can come out.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.600
So I thought I didn't want the Nine-Tails' power anymore.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:51.030
But I need the Nine-Tails' chakra to fight Sasuke.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.600
I can't hide from that forever.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.930
No use getting depressed!

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.000
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Storage"

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.800
I'm going to conquer this thing, Dad!

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.800
Tune in again!
