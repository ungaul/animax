WEBVTT

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.800
Sage Art: Super Giant Rasengan!

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.370
So fast!

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.830
Do you think you can beat me?

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.830
Why would I break the seal otherwise?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.870
Besides…

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.000
We gotcha!

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.730
Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken!

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.430
Do it now!

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.200
You…bastard!

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.300
He's weakening! Now's my chance.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.870
Hatred…

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.670
Suffering… I want to kill…

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.300
Help!

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.470
I hate all this!

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.370
It's not going to work anyway.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.170
I'll get revenge!

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.100
What is this?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.230
This is bad!

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.270
Don't give in, Naruto! Fool, ya fool!

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.600
You cannot control my power!

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.230
You are just a small portion of my hatred!

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.170
Is he the one?

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.500
Get lost!

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.370
No one will ever respect someone like you!

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.470
Get lost! Get lost!

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.930
Just go away!

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.500
Shut up!

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.030
Nine Tails' hatred is greater than I imagined.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.570
This could get bad for real. This is quite an ordeal!

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.830
I'll stop him.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.000
Go away and disappear!

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.730
It's all right, you can stay right here.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.000
Naruto…

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.870
The Orange Spark The Orange Spark Naruto…

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.070
What? What are you doing here?

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.430
And how come you know my name?

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.030
Oh yes, that's right.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.000
Well then, Naruto, can you guess who I am?

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.700
No way…

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.070
Have you figured it out?

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.200
You're Nine Tails' real form!

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.070
That's such a crude laugh!

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.600
You trying to fool me

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.800
by disguising yourself as a woman, Nine Tails?

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.970
You got it wrong, ya know!

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.800
Ouch!

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.830
Huh? "Ya know"?

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.530
I couldn't stop myself from hitting you.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.930
I was born impatient, and I talk fast,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.130
so I use some weird phrases.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.230
I try to control it, but it slips out when I get excited.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.800
What about you?

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.930
I hope you didn't get any of my bad speech patterns.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.900
Then…

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.370
Minato, didn't say anything to you?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.200
Shame on him.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.830
Yes… I'm…

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.270
I've wanted…

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.270
I've wanted to meet you for so long, Ma…ya know?

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.030
"Ya know," huh?

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.830
You really are my child.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.630
The Nine Tails transformation stopped.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.630
Did you do something, Yamato?

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.830
No, it seems to have stopped on its own.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.200
What happened?

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.170
There's a ton of stuff

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.500
I wanted to ask you when I met you!

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.700
Sure, you can ask me anything.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.300
But first, we have to tame the Nine Tails.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.370
This chakra…

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.370
Kushina, is that you?

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.070
Minato imbedded my chakra into the seal formula,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.400
so that when the time came for you to take control

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.630
of the Nine Tails' power, I could be of help.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.230
Are you listening?

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.530
I'm glad that you're so beautiful, Ma!

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.200
Well, thank you!

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.500
Your hair is just like your father's,

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.000
but I'm sorry you inherited my looks, Naruto.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.600
Why?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.830
If I got my pretty mom's looks,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.000
that makes me handsome, right?

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.130
And you have nice, straight red hair.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.430
I wish my hair were like that too!

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.570
You're the second man to compliment my red hair.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.170
Really? Who was the first?

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.570
Who else? Your father.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.800
Oh! That's right!

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.530
What is it?

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.330
Hey, hey!

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.570
I always wanted to ask you one thing if I ever met you!

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.300
How did you and Dad fall in love?

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.230
What an embarrassing thing to ask, ya know!

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.530
Hey! You said, "ya know!"

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.330
You're excited!

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.730
In this case, it's more like shaken up, ya know!

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.330
Hey, you said it again!

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.270
Let's see…

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.630
It was the first day I came to the Hidden Leaf Village…

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.500
That's when I first met your father, Minato.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.770
All right. We have a new transfer student today

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.230
who will be attending our Academy.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.300
I'm Kushina Uzumaki, ya know!

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.530
Oh!

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.530
Look at the color of her hair.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.030
How can anyone have hair like that?

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.200
How do you get it that red?

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.800
Her hair's really weird!

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.730
– I wouldn't go out with hair like that. – Hey! Be quiet! Settle down!

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.300
I'm…

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.100
I'm going to become the village's first female Hokage!

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.670
I want to become a great Hokage

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.800
who will be admired by everyone in the village too!

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.170
A Hokage who is admired by everyone in the village, huh.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.570
Back then, he wasn't very manly and didn't look too dependable.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.870
So I didn't take Minato seriously

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.570
or believe for a minute that he could become a Hokage.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.400
Why not? Dad looked so strong.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.230
You're right.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.600
But back then, I was young and very ignorant.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.470
But I sure was arrogant, having moved from another village

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.600
and announcing that I was going to become the Hokage.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.500
After that, I started getting teased by the boys.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.270
They nicknamed me…

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.700
Tomato!

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.970
From today, we're going to call you Tomato!

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.800
You have a fat, round face with red hair.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.670
Just like a tomato!

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.830
As if a tomato can become the Hokage!

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.100
I hate tomatoes!

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.070
Me too!

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.030
I never eat it in my salad!

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.070
A tomato that everyone hates

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.570
could never be accepted as the Hokage!

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.230
So that's it!

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:03.830
I'll bet it was Dad who protected you from those bullies!

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.200
No, you're dead wrong!

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.800
Tomato… I grudgingly accepted being called that name.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.000
It was embarrassing, but it fit me perfectly.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.030
You're getting redder and riper!

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.000
It's the Tomato Festival! It's time to harvest!

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.900
Who're you calling Tomato?

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.100
Now you listen… I hate tomatoes too, ya know!

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.430
Keep calling me Tomato

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.870
and you're going to get it, ya know!

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.830
What are you laughing at?

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.170
I always beat those bullies at their own game

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.000
and turned them into smashed tomatoes.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.200
The girl with the long red hair who beat the boys half to death.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.430
As expected, I was stuck with a new nickname…

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.800
The Red-Hot Habanero!

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.570
Kiba and Shikamaru were always saying

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.030
that mothers are really scary.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.130
Always fighting.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.400
Naturally, I always won these fights as the Red-Hot Habanero.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.030
But…

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.170
Are you the one who's always making my kid brother cry?

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.270
That's because he's always messing with me, ya know!

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.930
And he‘s such a wimp!

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.430
I'm a genin! Cool, huh?

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.970
I have to teach anyone who bullies my kid brother a lesson.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.470
A real kunai?

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.900
You can't even recognize a Substitution Jutsu?

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.970
You're still just a kid!

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.230
Your hair's so red… and it's stiff like thread.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.030
Hair like this is ugly!

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.200
Serves you right!

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.900
I…

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:57.570
I don't like my hair either!

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:14.570
But…

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.930
Even with hair like this, I'm still me!

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.900
What choice do I have?

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.370
It's the Red-Hot Habanero!

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.600
Outsider!

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.600
As if an outsider can become the Hokage!

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.800
You're not going to help me because I'm an outsider?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.530
I… I bet you agree with them too!

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.830
It's because I don't want to be an outsider…

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.470
It's because I want this village to be my home…

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.670
That's the only reason why I said that.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.070
Who would want to become the Hokage anyway?!

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.000
I used to hate my hair.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:46.370
But a certain incident changed the way I felt about my red hair.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.630
A certain incident?

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.030
I'm home!

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.700
I'm home.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:02.800
Is…

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.170
Is anyone home?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.170
Someone!

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.770
Help me!

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.900
I have a special kind of chakra.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.030
Because of that, the Hidden Cloud kidnapped me.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.600
Hey!

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:07.130
At that time, in order to leave a trail behind

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.400
as I was being taken away,

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.970
I cut off pieces of my hair and dropped it…

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.300
without the enemy knowing.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.430
But since I was an outsider,

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:25.100
I didn't hold out hope that anyone would come to rescue me.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.230
We had come to the edge of the border

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.400
and I thought it was all over…

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.800
Are you hurt?

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.100
I came to save you.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.970
You'll be all right now.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.900
Hey, wait a minute!

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.330
That's…

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.670
Your hair is beautiful. So I noticed it right away.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.030
But you've always ignored me.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.230
Because I know that you're strong,

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.130
in body and in spirit.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.800
But this is a fight between two villages.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.500
It's different from your other fights, so…

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:01.270
So?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.930
I didn't want to lose you.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.830
Even if I'm an outsider?

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.000
Why do you say that?

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:17.300
You live in Hidden Leaf Village, so you're one of us.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.270
At that moment, Minato was a great ninja in my eyes.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.670
He was the man of my dreams.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.300
He changed me.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.330
This red hair that I used to hate

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.000
brought me the man of my destiny.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.200
And it became the "red thread of fate."

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.100
After that, I learned to love my hair.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.600
And…

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.400
I fell in love with Minato.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.670
Only men who compliment my hair

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.700
get to hear these precious words from me.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.000
Naruto, will you accept them?

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:01.900
Uh-huh!

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.330
I love you.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.130
When you put the Yellow Flash of the Leaf

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.600
and Red-Hot Habanero together…

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.570
You get the Leaf's Orange Hokage!

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.170
That's cool, ya know!

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:37.870
Hokage…

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:44.070
Your dream is the continuation of Minato's and my dream.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.400
Yeah, I won't let your dreams down!

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.130
Naruto…

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.670
But…before that…

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.130
Naruto, listen carefully. We're out of time.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.230
What do you mean we're out of time?

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.730
I need to tell you the reason why Nine Tails was sealed inside you.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.230
It has to do with an incident that happened 16 years ago.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:49.900
Sixteen years ago?

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.200
That's right. Sixteen years ago on October 10th…

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.830
The day you were born.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.500
Next time on Naruto Shippuden, "Target: Nine Tails"

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.700
Tell me what happened!

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.700
Tune in again!
