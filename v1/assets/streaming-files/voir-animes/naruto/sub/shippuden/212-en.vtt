00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.400
Kabuto Yakushi If you want to know who you are…

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.280
You must re-examine and acknowledge your true self.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.980
Those who cannot acknowledge themselves will fail…

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.480
Just like I did.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.860
I was nobody…

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.940
and had nothing from the very beginning.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.900
Kabuto, are you able to keep going?

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.730
Yes, Mother!

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.070
I know it's for the sake of the orphanage,

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.440
but why do we have to help shinobi like them?

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.940
Doing nothing doesn't bring in money…

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.650
Urushi, could you get more bandages?

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.820
Yeah, sure!

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.230
You're not a shinobi,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.860
but you're quite skilled at Medical Ninjutsu…

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.820
Mother taught me.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.030
You said your name was Kabuto?

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.730
Why don't you become a shinobi?

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.940
You'd make a good one…

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.610
I'm sure of it.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.400
I'm not interested in that.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.280
I just want to help raise money for the orphanage

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.280
and help Mother there.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.190
She's done so much for me…

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.530
but I've only been able to repay her with a pair of eyeglasses…

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.110
Really? What a shame.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.940
You were known as the Wandering Nun,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.110
and now you're just a babysitter.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.190
It's been a while since I last saw you,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.030
but you're looking a little tired, Nonou.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.070
I cast aside that name long ago.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.440
Talks with the Leaf for monetary aid were concluded.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.570
So why are you here now?

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.230
It seems the Espionage Unit's former top spy

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.860
stopped knowing things after she left the Foundation.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.280
We did not come here only in regard to the aid money.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.150
In this time of war,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.690
we have obtained intel that the Hidden Stone are plotting

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.070
some sort of large-scale operation.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.440
We want you to infiltrate the Hidden Stone

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.440
and verify the validity of this intel.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.820
And if it does turn out to be true,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.190
you are to investigate what this operation entails

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.730
and where it will occur and report back to us.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.940
This will likely be a long-term mission.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.570
Then you've come to the wrong person.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.650
I'm no longer…

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.280
You people don't understand just how essential Mother is

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.320
to this orphanage and to the children!

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.280
She has done her utmost to protect this orphanage.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.110
Such a dangerous task!

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.280
You Foundation people ought to do it yourselves.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.900
Why must you come and bother her?

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.900
The Wandering Nun is the only one

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.610
we can entrust this long-term mission to.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.150
Currently, no one in the Foundation has her espionage skills.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.860
Most would likely break or end up switching allegiances.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.110
I know that she's a Kunoichi

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.980
who would never sell out the Hidden Leaf…

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.570
From that expression,

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.980
I can tell you've already guessed it, Nonou.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.690
Yes, if you refuse, this clinic will stop receiving funding.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.030
That's not fair!

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.150
This was already settled with the Third Hokage!

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.690
You cannot do this!

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.190
This orphanage looks easy to break into and rob…

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.480
You should hire bodyguards to prevent robbers

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.900
from stealing your money.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.820
That is, if you can afford any.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.650
While you're at it,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.980
take care that your children don't get snatched either.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.860
Children with no past or family are worth something.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.570
You're all rotten!

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.030
How dare you call yourselves shinobi?!

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.980
You're the ones who don't understand!

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.820
It's a small price to pay to protect the Hidden Leaf!

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.320
I understand.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.730
Wait, Mother…!

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.650
It's come to this because you couldn't kill your emotions.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.610
You weren't suited for the Foundation, after all.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.900
How dare you…!

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.900
Also, I've already lost a subordinate obtaining this intel…

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.110
I'll be taking one of the children here to take his place.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.440
How far will you go?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.480
I said I'd accept the mission!

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.980
This is a separate matter.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.320
Your mission shall cover subsequent payments.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.070
But this current one is in exchange for the child.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:36.150
Some children actually wish to become a Leaf Shinobi, after all.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.650
You should ask them to choose for themselves.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.900
There may just be one such child.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.530
Why, Kabuto?

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.480
I think I'm suited to be a ninja.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.900
Besides, I want to hone my Medical Ninjutsu.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.570
Kabuto! You're just going to throw away the three years you spent with us?!

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.980
Come back here!

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.530
Have you forgotten the house rules, everyone?

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.030
It's way past lights-out.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.690
It's no use. I'm surrounded.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.530
If I hadn't messed up, I'd be in bed by now.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.690
It's been five years since I left the orphanage.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.610
I wish I could've seen Mother and everyone else one last time…

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.980
Mother!

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.070
No! Why are you here?

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.900
We want you to infiltrate the Hidden Stone…

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.320
The Wandering Nun is the only one

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.940
we can entrust this long-term mission to.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.570
Don't tell me…you were still on that last mission?!

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.820
Why are you healing my wounds?

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.860
Who are you…?

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.230
It's me, Mother!

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.820
It's Kabuto! Don't worry, I'll save you.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.070
Who…are you…?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.360
This way!

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.980
Damn it! Nanigashi's been killed!

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.940
Mother didn't know me? Why?

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.940
Why didn't she remember me? Why?

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.980
If she doesn't remember me, then who was I all this time?

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.940
What were all those things I received from Mother?

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.070
My name, that I was one of Mother's children,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.110
even these glasses…

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.820
Who…

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.440
are you?

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.940
This isn't me…

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.980
This isn't the real me…

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.900
It seems you no longer see yourself clearly.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.480
You've become a fine shinobi.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.320
I remember you…Kabuto.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.440
A-Aren't you…?!

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.070
I've been watching you this whole time.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.030
Along with Nonou.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.440
Come with me.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.110
Then I'll tell you everything you want to know.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.610
What I want to know? What does that mean?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.360
Why Mother targeted you…

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.690
and why she didn't remember you at all.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.030
Don't you want to know…all that?

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:59.150
This is my hideout. No one knows about it.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.070
Which means you are my very first visitor.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.570
Why did you bring me here?!

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.400
What are you going to do with me?

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.690
You are becoming more and more curious.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.940
That's a good thing.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.940
People can never escape their curiosity.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.780
Which is why you followed me here.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.190
Then tell me quickly!

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.530
You know what I want to know, don't you?

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.530
To be frank, the Foundation had decided

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.780
to dispose of both you and Mother.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.530
What do you mean?!

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.570
You both were too brilliant as spies.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.900
You ended up knowing too much.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.940
What?!

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.030
We risked our lives for so long,

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.030
gathering intel for the sake of the village…

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.070
And this is what we get?

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.530
At times, intel becomes even more powerful

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.070
than the mightiest jutsu or weapon.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.730
You are seen as a very dangerous person right now.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:12.070
Well, your fate had been decided from the very beginning…

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.940
It was in the scenario

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.070
for you to kill each other in a mutual strike.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.400
Right after you left the orphanage,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.440
Danzo revealed to Mother the real reason why you had left.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.110
That you sacrificed yourself

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.360
and joined the Foundation for money for the orphanage.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.980
Mother wished to liberate you from the Foundation.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.110
As a condition of accepting her wish, Danzo ordered the assassination

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.280
of a certain person several years ago.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:53.610
Ironically… The target of the assassination… was you.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.030
I thought it was the condition for my release!

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.940
Why didn't Mother realize it was me?!

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.690
I told you… The Foundation intended for the two of you

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.570
to take each other out.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.610
And there was other trickery afoot.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.730
Trickery?

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.780
You and Mother were sent into separate enemy territories

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.820
so that you two would never meet,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.110
and Mother was kept informed of your well-being

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.230
and progress through photos.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.230
The photos of you were skillfully replaced

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.480
with those of another without her noticing it.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:38.440
Over time, Mother was made to think someone else was you.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.440
Gradual brainwashing.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.280
A common practice used by the Foundation.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.030
That's the other Kabuto.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.030
And so, Nonou tried to kill you,

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.570
never in her wildest dreams imagining that you were Kabuto…

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.280
She thought you were a double agent who betrayed the village.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:08.070
And the Foundation dispatched you to deal with whoever was left…

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.400
Is that it?

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.030
For someone who knows nothing about himself…

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.900
You're very perceptive.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.070
I always wanted… an explanation about who I was!

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.900
And I thought I had finally found it!

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.070
But thanks to you Foundation bastards,

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.280
I've lost myself again!

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.980
These glasses were what linked me to Mother!

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.110
The name she gave me was mine and mine alone!

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.820
Mother was supposed to be the parent

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.900
that didn't forget me, no matter what!

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.070
But everything's wrong!

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.900
Then who in the world…

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.900
am I?!

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.730
You merely lack sufficient intel with which to define yourself.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.110
It's just that neither the glasses, your name,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.730
nor the fact that you're her child

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.820
were things that denote who you really are.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.900
And that's fine.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.900
If you're not satisfied with what you've had so far…

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.400
Just find other things and add them onto yourself,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.320
one by one.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.730
If you plan on killing me…

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.150
why are you telling me all this?

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:36.030
I also want to know who or what I am.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.400
And I've been collecting all sorts of things.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.190
I repeatedly experiment on and inspect these many things

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.820
I've collected a little at a time…

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.440
and store the gained knowledge and abilities within myself.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.150
And then, I undergo rebirth,

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.280
ever evolving toward a more perfect me.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.150
Afterward, I again obtain even newer items.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.980
This time…

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.820
it's you.

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:16.400
There's no way you couldn't derive who you are and what you are

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:22.280
by gathering all the intel and things that exist in this world.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.940
Why am I one of those things to you?

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.980
Because I recognize your talent

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.900
more than anyone else in this world.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.030
It would be a waste to kill you.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:41.730
Besides, this medical research facility was prepared just for you.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.980
What are you plotting?

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.610
Instead of the Foundation which erases individuality…

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.360
I will create an organization that guides individuality.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.980
I will create a village.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.110
The Village of the Hidden Sound… that does not belong to any nation.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.980
From this moment,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.940
you and I will desert the Hidden Leaf's Foundation.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.480
From this moment,

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.480
I shall be your superior, your brother, and your parent.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.940
I will protect you from Danzo.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.610
From this moment,

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.110
this will be your new personal history:

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.610
When you were very young, you were found and raised

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.070
by a Medical Corps Captain following the Battle at Kikyo Pass.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.980
After returning to work under Danzo,

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:29.400
Nonou Yakushi kept her cover as a captain of the Medical Unit…

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.690
and you shall be reborn today as her son, Kabuto Yakushi.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.360
I am Orochimaru.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.150
If you want to know who and what you are…

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.110
Come…be by my side.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.940
There's another organization I want to look into…

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.730
Please leave it to me.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.280
What is this organization?

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.110
The Akatsuki.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:31.280
Bring me Orochimaru's human experimentation data

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.780
and any intel on the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.110
Understood, Lord Sasori.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.980
You are useful.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:47.030
You can erase your sound, your scent, even yourself.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.650
You're just like one of my puppets.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.530
If you're not satisfied with what you've had so far…

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.280
Just find other things…

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.280
and add them onto yourself, one by one.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.110
It's still…not enough…

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.400
This is…still not me…!

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.320
Are you sure we can't kill him?

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.030
We're stuck playing catch-up!

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.610
I told you no!

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.610
He controls the battlefield right now. Be patient.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.440
Is the Izanami still not ready?

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.940
He's about to come after us!

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.570
I'm already on him.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.110
It's just going to take a little more time.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.820
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Izanami Activated"

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:03.230
I've shut off my vision, so genjutsu won't work on me!

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.980
THE IZANAMI ACTIVATED Tune in again!
