WEBVTT

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.150
Are you leaving already?

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.400
Yes.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.820
I see…

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.520
You awakened your Sharingan at age eight…

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.980
I supposed the Village wants to observe your abilities.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.270
This just shows how much power and influence the Sharingan holds.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.230
I want you to be aware of that.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.770
It brings joy to the clan when one of its own excels.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.770
Of course, I'm very proud of you too.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.610
He died…

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.070
Father.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.690
But, do not rest on your laurels

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.070
just because you have the Sharingan now.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.860
In order to sharpen the power in your eyes,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.520
you must continue to be diligent.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.190
Well, I don't need to lecture you.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.110
You are my son, after all.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.070
My friend died…

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.150
But, Father is…

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.570
Yes, Father.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.230
I will continue to be diligent.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.980
Good.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.940
I'll be on my way now.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.980
Big Brother!

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.400
You said you'd play with me today!

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.900
That's right, I did, didn't I?

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.110
But I have a mission.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.070
Forgive me, Sasuke. Next time.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.610
Sorry about that, Sasuke.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.320
I'm gonna borrow your brother for a little bit.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.270
Itachi's Story – Light and Darkness: Shisui's Request

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.840
Why did you lie?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.420
Sasuke resents me now.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.420
NO TRESPASSING I know that was wrong of me…

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.760
But Sasuke's a smart kid… I think he'll understand.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.010
"First, have one genin accompany you,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.050
"and secure the scroll in question."

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.260
Even if my training exercise required a genin,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.470
it really didn't have to be you.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.010
Don't say that now!

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.340
Even if it's not a real mission,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.090
none other than Shisui the jonin requested me.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.130
I'm not lying when I say it's a mission, right?

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.340
Well, you're half right.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.260
Let's go.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.130
What are the details of the training exercise?

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.840
There are three parts.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.170
The first part is to find traces left by a fugitive, and then to track him.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.630
Pretty good!

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.510
Let's start from here.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.130
A footprint left on moss…

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.970
As expected from Shisui…

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.090
He doesn't miss the slightest details.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.970
This is…

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.340
Our guy stepped on a piece of a branch…

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.590
Very perceptive of you!

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.840
But, that's just a decoy.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.720
Dry wood like that would snap when stepped on…

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.670
but this piece still has a lot of moisture.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.760
Also, see this clean cut?

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.130
Obviously, he was in a hurry to make a decoy…

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.920
Sloppy work.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.130
Don't be disappointed…

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.970
An animal could have left that indentation in the moss,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.800
but only humans make decoys.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.920
And if he laid the decoy over in that direction…

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.010
A stone?

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.090
Yes.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.630
The underside is dry and the top is damp.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.220
Could this be a decoy too?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.380
Well…That's very possible.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.010
The moisture on the rock will tell us

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.760
how long ago he was here.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.670
I see!

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.050
Judging from the dryness, only a short while has passed.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.260
This scent!

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.010
Perfect!

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.880
Let's go!

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.090
I think a fish left that mark behind.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.090
So it's not a decoy?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.010
No. That's the main purpose of leaving decoys.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.970
Everything starts to look like them.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.340
Confusing their pursuers gives the fugitive many additional options.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.670
At this rate, there's no way I can find the fugitive by myself.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.050
I need to develop better tracking skills.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.840
You're half right.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.130
Here.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.420
Drink up.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.380
It's because you're exceptional, Itachi…

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.130
That's why… I bet you've never tried to understand

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.720
the feelings of someone who's not.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.670
Having the skills to track a fugitive is important,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.260
but so is understanding how he thinks.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.090
If you can understand his mindset,

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.670
sometimes you can thwart a fugitive even without those skills.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.470
I see!

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.340
So…

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.760
Let's move on to the second part of the training exercise.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.510
The second part?

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.970
Yeah… To encamp at night.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.920
The textbook said campfires are prohibited.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.130
So does this mean there's another reason behind doing this?

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.920
Just eat.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.010
You're exceptional, Itachi.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.170
I'm still inexperienced.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.130
Earlier, if I had more skills…

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:33.720
That's true.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.510
Don't laugh!

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.590
Sorry, sorry… It just makes me happy.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.470
"Happy"?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.220
Huh? No!

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.720
Just listen…

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.130
I thought that there was really nothing I could teach you.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.220
But…

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.420
You taught me a lot today.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.470
Yeah… And that's what made me happy.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.880
So… Hmm?

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.090
What about this campfire?

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.300
Oh…

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.550
It's nice to share a meal with someone you feel at ease with.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.760
Enjoying a hot meal helps cheer you up.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.920
Eat it while it's hot.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.090
Yeah… It's warm and tasty!

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.170
Told you so!

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.090
But…

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.800
If I'm really exceptional…

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.800
He wouldn't have died.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.380
I'm still so inexperienced.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.050
So why would someone like me…

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.090
I… Hmm?

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.470
Awakened the Sharingan…

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.260
I see…

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.510
Is that why…you lied?

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.260
"Lied"?

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.880
You said the same thing at the start of practice.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.510
You're good at fooling yourself.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.920
That's why you can't grasp your true feelings.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.550
You didn't want to stay at home, right?

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.260
That's the look you had on your face.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.010
That might be true…

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.420
Shisui picked up on how I felt from the very beginning…

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.470
I'll be happy to listen any time you want to talk.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.880
The final part of the training exercise is about to start.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.810
I'll assist you to the best of my abilities!

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.180
The pursuers are ANBU?!

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.640
Is this an exercise?

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.970
No… Put that out of your mind for now.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.930
Why are you attacking a fellow Leaf shinobi?

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.520
Would you consider forgetting that you saw this and leaving?

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.390
If you're going to kill a comrade,

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.060
I can't look the other way without hearing a reason!

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.350
The truth is…

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.350
We're going after those who betrayed the village.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.220
Where's the proof that he betrayed you?

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.270
What a waste of time.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.180
Let's just kill them all.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.180
Just wait…

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.390
It's not that he's a traitor.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.640
But he has evidence that proves who the traitor is in that scroll.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.680
If he hands it over, we will disappear.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.350
So she says…

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.850
You want the intel… but for what purpose?

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.640
Isn't it obvious?!

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.680
Anyone who threatens the village will be punished…

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.270
We maintain the order in Leaf Village with our code of darkness!

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.970
You don't have the right to judge!

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.600
I will hand this secret missive to Lord Hokage…

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.600
Lord Hokage will make a fair and just judgment!

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.020
"A fair and just judgment"?

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.220
How naïve.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.350
You betray the village, you die. That's that.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.600
Even a traitor has a reason behind their actions!

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.850
The Hokage's wish is to investigate that carefully.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.180
That's one way of thinking.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.640
However… This involves the entire village.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.180
The gravity of one traitor versus one village is far too great.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:34.720
What would Shisui…?

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.680
He took the opportunity to substitute himself out

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.180
while we were "advising" him… Don't worry.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.140
My wire is coated with poison.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.890
His body will go numb and he won't go far.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.220
Without words, they carry out their purpose with blades…

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.180
Leave it to the ANBU…

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.220
Or rather, Lord Danzo's Foundation, right?

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.640
Nameless individuals who maintain peace from the shadows…

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.060
I believe that is a true shinobi.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.060
Then you share our beliefs.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.220
No, you're wrong!

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.390
Order maintained through the power of the blade…

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.520
…is not peace!

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:18.640
I…

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.220
Itachi…stay out of this!

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.430
I am Itachi Uchiha!

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.310
I will fight alongside Shisui!

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:26.850
Itachi!

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.430
So this is the how the ANBU fight.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.770
The Uchiha would dare to push their luck and defy us?

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.600
We will not show mercy, even to children.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.310
At least make it fun for us!

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.680
The one your friend is fighting,

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.310
is a kunoichi who's unrivaled within the Foundation.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.430
If you don't stop him quickly, he will die.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.140
Retreat!

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.100
Don't underestimate the Uchiha!

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.850
Besides…he's exceptional!

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.930
Sharingan!

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.350
She keeps mixing it up with double and triple layers.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:49.720
But…!

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.560
I thought he was just a child, but he has the Sharingan already?

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.310
I can see it!

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.720
So this is the power of the Sharingan!

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.220
There's no right way or wrong way to fight in a battle.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.220
But… I've already seen through your attacks.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.100
I don't think so…

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.140
You have already fallen into my trap.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.970
You're pretty good, even though you're a child.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.770
What--? How?!

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.720
I told you…

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.890
I've seen through your attacks.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.640
That threaded ninja tool you threw…

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.220
I changed its trajectory just a little bit.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.310
You…damn Uchiha!

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.020
Itachi seems to be doing fine.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.180
So I'll end things on my end!

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.310
Teleportation Jutsu!

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.560
Shadow Clones…

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.140
No, they're just Afterimage Clones.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.310
If they're just afterimages, I'll sense out the real one…

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.770
What…? This is weird.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.350
I can't see the real one!

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.310
Get the hell outta here!

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.350
He didn't fly off!

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:56.060
Namely…he has no mass. But his attack is powerful…

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.600
What's going on?

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.100
My Teleportation Jutsu has no mass.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.350
But you could say everything has mass.

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.270
It seems the jonin observing our training exercise have noticed.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.470
We will be watching you from the shadows…

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.560
Shisui Uchiha… Itachi Uchiha!

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.180
This is…!

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.680
It's not a fatal wound. Don't worry about it.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.720
Back then…if I had observed the enemy more carefully…

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.220
Never mind that…

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.270
He wants us to forget this incident ever happened.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.770
His life was threatened! So why?

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.680
If this incident becomes known,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.100
it will sow the seeds for a new conflict.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.680
This is not what Lord Hokage wants.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.720
The ones who aid peace from the shadows are also…nameless.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.850
So there was fighting,

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.770
but you assumed it was part of the training exercise?

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.770
I'm sorry.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.850
They were extremely strong,

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.140
and I was doing my best to protect the genin,

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.140
so I didn't see their faces…

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.140
No, we're at fault for not catching their infiltration too.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.310
I'm glad neither of you are hurt.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.470
I'd like to talk to you more about this tomorrow.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.470
But this training exercise is over.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.350
Itachi, let's go home.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.350
What's the matter?

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.600
Ah… You sprained your ankle.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.180
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.850
When you first awaken the Sharingan,

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.970
sometimes there's a "slight gap"

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.140
between the image your brain foresees and your body's reaction time.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:00.140
And when you try too hard to compensate for that slight gap…

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.680
this happens.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.270
I said you're making a big deal out of nothing.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.770
Oww!

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.140
No matter how exceptional you are, Itachi…

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.270
don't overdo it.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.890
It's not funny!

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.350
I'm sorry!

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:21.930
I'm just happy.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.390
You're really like a kid brother to me.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.020
So being able to take you under my wing like this makes me happy.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.640
I want you to think of me as your older brother

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.310
and depend on me for anything.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.270
Shisui… Hmm?

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.930
About the ANBU…

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.970
Oh… Did I make the right decision?

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.310
I won't say yes.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.310
I don't even know if there is such a thing as justice

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.970
in the Shinobi World.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.220
But that's…!

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.970
We fight believing in our own justice.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.350
But if the enemy is doing the same thing, who's right?

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.930
You realized that during today's exercise, didn't you?

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.520
There's more than one side to an issue.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.310
You must consider things from various viewpoints.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.310
"Various…viewpoints"?

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.600
You must be tired from using your Sharingan.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.180
Go ahead and sleep.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.680
But there's one thing that's certain…

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.220
I will never, ever betray you.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.640
That's the one thing that's certain.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.770
So it's come to this.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:39.770
Shisui…

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.350
I'm…

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.390
I'm Itachi Uchiha. I'll be part of ANBU from today.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.270
I'm looking forward to working with you.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.850
I'm going to watch over the Hidden Leaf from within the shadows.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.020
Starting from today, you are an ANBU squad leader.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.270
You're not part of the Foundation,

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.520
but your missions will come from me.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.850
There's no need to tell Hiruzen about this.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:50.770
Yes, sir.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.310
I know it's sudden but, I have a mission for you.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.770
It's a simple assassination.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.390
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Moonlit Night"

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.180
I'm assigning the two behind you as your subordinates.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.850
Itachi's Story - Light and Darkness: Moonlit Night

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:17.640
Tune in again!
