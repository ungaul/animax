00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.170
Return...Sasuke...to us...!

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.570
He doesn't belong to you...

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.730
Don't talk about Sasuke in front of me,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.830
like he belongs to you!

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.700
Interesting...

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.170
The Top-Secret Mission Begins 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.570
With Chakra alone...

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.900
With Chakra alone, he caused this much damage...

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.670
Sakura!

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.070
What incredible Chakra...

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.370
Beyond that, it's going out of control, like it has a will of its own...

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.470
But this is the perfect opportunity...

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.030
Finally, the top-secret mission starts.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.130
Sakura! Answer me!

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.500
Did she hit her head when she fell just now?

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.130
Passing out at a time like this...!

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.830
Wood Style Ninjutsu!

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.500
I can't support it...!

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll!

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.200
Sai!

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.770
Sai! Help Sakura...

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.370
Damn!

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.530
I see...

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.300
You borrow the power of the Jinchuriki...

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.200
And yet, that's the best you can do...

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.300
You're still no match for Sasuke...

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.570
What is...this place...?

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.370
Sasuke...?

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.770
Sasuke!

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:03.800
Wait...

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.030
Wait for me...!

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.670
Sasuke...

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.670
Damn it...!

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:17.200
I don't have...the power to bring Sasuke back...

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:29.430
That time...back then... if only I had been stronger...

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:39.670
Sasuke! I won't let Orochimaru take you.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.730
I'll stop you even if ...

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:47.030
I have to break every bone in your arms and legs!

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.270
You can't even put a scratch on my forehead.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.200
That much has not changed.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.930
It's hopeless, I tell you...

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.500
Naruto...

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.730
you were a special one...

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.400
but...

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.530
I am even more special than you!

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.170
Chidori!

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.800
Rasengan!

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.330
- Chidori! - Rasengan!

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.530
I am weak, so my words don't reach him...

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.500
Because I am weak, I can't win his recognition...

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:05.870
So...whatever happens, I must become stronger...

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:19.170
So that the bond I've finally forged will not be severed...

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:31.430
So that Sasuke won't sever the connection between me...!

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:10.100
SEAL

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:45.000
This feeling...it's different from before, isn't it...?

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.370
Sakura, snap out of it! Hey, Sakura!

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.400
Are you all right?

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.670
Y-Yes...

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.330
Hey...!

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:16.830
Sorry...

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.830
I'm okay now...

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.770
What happened here...?

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.200
Naruto did it...

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.700
The Jinchuriki...

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.670
It only stands to reason that they'd want it too...

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.370
Where's Naruto now?!

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:58.230
On the other side of the bridge... with Orochimaru.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.100
Naruto is a real handful...

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.230
What's that smoke...?

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.500
I have a bad feeling about this...

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.670
Wood Clone Jutsu!

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.200
I'm counting on you!

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.330
Right.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.870
Wood Style: Doomed Wall!

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.500
Naruto...!

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.030
Simply unbelievable,

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.100
the things this child can do...

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:39.900
Oh shoot...

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.070
Damn it!

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.470
He unleashed a shock wave of that magnitude...

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.400
simply by swinging one of his arms down. Good grief!

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.400
Is that Naruto's Nine-Tailed power?

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.100
Yes, it is.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.230
Please tell me, Captain Yamato.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.270
You know something about Naruto, don't you?

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:55.700
Sakura... What on earth will become of Naruto?

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.770
He'll be fine. You don't have to worry.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.230
It was for just such times as this that I was chosen as Team Captain.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.270
Next time: "Orochimaru vs. Jinchuriki"
