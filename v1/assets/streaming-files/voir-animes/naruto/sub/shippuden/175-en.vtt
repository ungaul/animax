WEBVTT

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.400
Captain Mifune!

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.440
We received a message from Headquarters!

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.940
The enemy force is passing through directly under us, deep underground!

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.360
Our shinobi in the Sensory Unit couldn't detect them?

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.900
They must not be human.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.400
All right!

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.820
Considering our Fifth Company's elongated deployment,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.340
I'll send in several platoons

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.300
DARUI-FIRST COMPANY MIFUNE-FIFTH COMPANY GAARA-FOURTH COMPANY KANKURO-COMMANDO UNIT KAKASHI-THIRD COMPANY closest in proximity to Kitsuchi and his Second Company as reinforcements!

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.530
Make haste!

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.610
I'm going to keep releasing them!

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.610
Zaji, take care of the signal fire!

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.400
Right!

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.230
Red smoke, that's the Commando Unit.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.360
Hurry!
Right.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.610
Are you all right, Master Zabuza?

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.150
Looks like we wasted a jutsu, Haku.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.230
This Reanimation Jutsu revives the dead, but they can't be killed.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.110
I don't like this jutsu…

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.820
You did well to detect them, Haku.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.610
That species of giant bird generally fly in pairs.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.530
They work together to catch their prey.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.730
However, that's only during the winter

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.610
when they are raising their young…

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.030
And that looks like a beacon made to look like a cloud.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.190
No doubt, the enemy that attacked is over there.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.860
Leave this to me.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.690
Lightning?

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.480
A cold air?

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.860
Secret Jutsu Crystal Ice Mirrors!

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.230
Owww…

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.900
H-Hey… That thing…

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.190
What? They're just kids.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.280
We can't die. So we can just strike.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.030
They are Kekkei Genkai shinobi!

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.780
I'm different.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.690
We bear no grudge against you.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.570
We're just not in control of our actions.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.730
They're coming!

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.530
Kakashi?

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.070
An Old Nemesis Returns Kakashi! You're a lifesaver!

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.940
Don't start celebrating yet.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.900
These guys are all pesky shinobi.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.940
I knew we would have to fight,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.570
but I never imaged it would be against you, Kakashi.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.400
Lightning Blade!

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.610
That day on the bridge,

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.070
you were supposed to finish me off and send me to hell.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.070
When I came to, I was in the same place as Haku.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.980
It seems this is neither heaven nor hell.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.400
This is the world of the living.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.440
You are under the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.780
Reanimation Jutsu?

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.690
That's right.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.980
The Akatsuki brought you back from the world of the dead.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.780
What? He knows them?

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.530
Wait for Captain Kakashi's signal.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.400
Zabuza… Haku…

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.610
Oh… You've matured, Kakashi's kunoichi.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.980
How is that kid?

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.610
Huh?

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.530
Uh-huh…

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.690
Who're you?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.190
Hey! Hey! Is this the one I should pick?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.190
Uh-huh.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.070
This one is the medicinal herb?

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.480
Thank you for helping me.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.440
You've got a lot to do early in the morning, sis…

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.400
You too… What've you been doing here so early?

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.530
Training! I want to get stronger.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.190
Oh? But you already look strong enough.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.900
No, no! I want to get even stronger!

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.280
What for?

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.940
To become the best ninja in my village!

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.610
I'm going to get everyone to recognize my strength!

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.530
And I have to prove something to someone!

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.530
Is that all for someone's sake?

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.480
Or is it for your own sake?

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.690
What's so funny?!

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.320
Do you have somebody precious in your life?

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.940
When a person has something precious they want to protect…

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.730
that's when they can truly become strong.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.070
I know that well enough too!

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.980
You'll get strong.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.570
I hope we meet again somewhere.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.190
Yeah!

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.980
We lost because of him…

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.150
He must be all grown up.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.650
He's probably famous too.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.530
Yeah, that bridge is now called the Great Naruto Bridge.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.980
Everyone in the village calls him the miraculous hero now.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.940
Thanks to you both, Naruto was able to find his Ninja Way.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.570
And he made a pledge at your graves,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.730
and he's grown into a fine shinobi since then.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.440
Then he will become even stronger.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.570
Were you able to reminisce a little?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.360
Because it's time to get serious.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.530
Power is welling up!

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.980
The main act starts now!

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.900
Kakashi… Stop us…

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.980
Retreat!

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.400
Kakashi, these people…

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.480
I know! There's no doubt!

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.780
The Demon Zabuza Momochi!

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.480
And Haku of the Ice Style!

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.530
Kakashi Sensei!

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.440
I am your opponent!

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:43.610
Haku!

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.400
Sorry, but this is going to be over in an instant.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.480
Sharingan, eh? Something like that won't work on me!

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.440
Ninja Art! Hidden Mist Jutsu!

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.610
You're mine!

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.150
This is the Silent Killing,

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.980
which brings down a foe only with sound.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.650
Why?! You were known as the demon of the Hidden Mist, Zabuza!

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.730
How can you stoop so low and become a mercenary?

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.320
Don't kid yourself!

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:24.320
In the shinobi world, it's either use or be used.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.400
And we shinobi are merely tools!

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.820
Shinobi don't need ideals!

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.440
Our world has no use for weak ninja.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.530
Why do you have to serve a guy like that?

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.280
I want to protect someone special to me.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.360
I want to make his dreams come true.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.530
Naruto, do you know how it feels to be unwanted?

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.480
Master Zabuza needs me.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.440
When I was old enough to understand things,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.820
my father tried to kill me.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.610
People with Kekkei Genkai were hated and feared in my homeland.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.480
And at that moment, what I thought of myself was that…

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.110
my existence didn't matter to anyone else in the world.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.730
Same with me.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.320
Master Zabuza took me in.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.610
He wanted me, needed me.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.070
I was so happy…

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.400
I am your weapon, Master Zabuza.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.780
Keep me by you as a mere tool that will heed your every word.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.530
But I just don't get it!

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.530
The only reason you are allowed to live is because you're strong?

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.780
I'm losing…consciousness…

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.400
Damn…

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.440
The inside of my head… feels so hot…

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.230
That demonic aura… So this is the Demon Zabuza!

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.110
On top of that, the Ice Style child!

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.730
On guard! Stay alert, Guy!

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.480
No one comes close to him in Silent Killing!

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.230
Kakashi… Please…

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.440
Stop us once again…

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.690
My dream was always to be Master Zabuza's tool

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.480
and die protecting him…

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.320
The fact that Master Zabuza is under the power of this jutsu means…

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.570
that I was not able to protect him from you back then.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.530
Furthermore, not only am I incapable of protecting Master Zabuza,

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.440
I can't even serve as his tool now.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.110
No, you protected Zabuza.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.320
No, you protected Zabuza.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.400
He died for a different reason.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.690
And…Zabuza never thought of you as a tool.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:30.480
K-Kakashi, quit babbling nonsense.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.610
Naruto dug deep into Zabuza's heart.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.940
He talked big, and this is how he ends up?

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.440
What a weakling.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.690
Haku!

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.650
You…!

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.230
Naruto, don't be reckless.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.400
We're outnumbered!

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.360
But… But…!

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:57.980
Enough, kid!

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.400
He's right. Haku died because he was weak.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.480
What're you saying?!

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.480
He threw his life away for you!

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.860
As Gato used me, I was simply using Haku.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.400
I thought I'd told you…

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:23.530
In the shinobi world, it's either use or be used.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.070
We shinobi are merely tools.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:32.730
What I wanted was his skills and not Haku himself.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.610
Do you… Do you really mean that?

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.530
Stop, Naruto!

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.320
He… He really liked you!

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.110
Is there someone special in your life?

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.360
He liked you that much!

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.400
When a person feels he wants to protect a person special to him,

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.730
that person can truly become strong.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.320
Even so, don't you feel anything at all?!

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.940
You really…honestly… don't feel anything at all?

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.480
I'd like to make that person's dream come true.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.530
For that, I could completely become a shinobi.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.440
When a person becomes as strong as you,

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.940
does that person really behave like you?

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.480
He threw his life away for you!

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.570
He didn't even fulfill his own dreams and yet…

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.400
to die as a tool!

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.110
That's… That's too painful.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.530
Kid…

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.480
Don't say anything more.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.780
Haku was…

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.570
He was hurting inside for you while he battled you guys too.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.610
I know. He was too kind.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.360
I'm glad we could fight with you at the end.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:00.230
Yes, kid, it's as you say, after all.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.730
Shinobi are human too.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.190
Maybe it's impossible to become an emotionless tool.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:09.980
It's my loss.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.570
Zabuza…

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.320
You guys stay out of this.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.230
This is my fight!

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.820
Snow… At this time of year?

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.230
Haku, are you crying?

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.150
You were always at my side.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.860
At the very least, I can be at your side in the end.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:03.610
If it's possible, I'd like to go to the same place as you.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.570
You will, Zabuza…

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.610
The two of you together.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.320
Zabuza and Haku, huh.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.530
They're quite tenacious.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.150
I still haven't been able to bind them completely

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.730
I'll soon turn you into mere killing puppets!

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.480
You are my tools!

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.780
K-Kakashi, don't hesitate.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.570
Use whatever means it takes… to stop me.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.530
I died already.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.530
I died human…

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.320
Yes, I know.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.070
Master Zabuza… Thank you.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:19.400
Here they come!

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.570
Captain Kakashi! That Hidden Rock shinobi…

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.400
A user of the Explosion Style Kekkei Genkai.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.610
He's a former Demolitions Unit captain like Deidara… That's Gari!

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.280
And that woman is…

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.730
the Scorch Style Kekkei Genkai user from the Hidden Sand…

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.820
Pakura!

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.280
Please be careful!

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.230
Kekkei Genkai shinobi…all of them.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.610
Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.280
The fighting unit will comprise mainly of sensory-type shinobi!

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.940
The rest will take a Manji Formation

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.230
at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock and provide cover!

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.110
We will pinpoint Zabuza using only sound!

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.440
The mist is becoming thicker.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.730
Our field of vision isn't good enough.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.820
Sakura, you don't need to be afraid!

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.400
I will guard you with my life!

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.480
The last time, they attacked the dead spot in this formation, the center.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.070
Watch your backs!

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.530
Leave it to me!

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.690
Huh? O-Oh, right!

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.530
After the mist…cold air.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:21.480
It's begun!

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.110
It's different from the last time, after all.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.110
To be able to bind so strongly…

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.690
As one would expect from Lord Orochimaru's chakra.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.570
To be able to overwrite my own control tags…

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.480
However, I purposely kept their emotions intact

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.110
to psychologically torment the enemy.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.030
That results in a weaker binding

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.480
and the soul dies when the heart undergoes a change.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.530
This time, I will kill all feeling.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.280
Right now, I don't know who among the enemy pawns I can do this to.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.780
I'll just gather data from this war.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.730
As for the rest of the pawns,

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.360
I'll bind them to the point of obeying my orders,

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.400
and leave them to their own accord.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.230
Some will probably be more beneficial with their emotions left intact.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.030
He was mummified.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.480
This jutsu…

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.110
Here they come!

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.570
Scorch Style! Super Steam Kill!

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.440
My insides…!

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.440
Explosion Style! Land Mine Fist!

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.230
No way… Tajiki blew up!

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.230
You bastard!

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.400
– Leaf Hurricane Whirlwinds! – Leaf Hurricane Whirlwinds!

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.480
Guy!

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.110
Comrades die on the battlefield!

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.480
That is one thing you must learn to accept!

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.480
Losing your cool can cause even more comrades to die!

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.860
Place your comrade's death into the recesses of your mind!

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.400
Understand, newbie?

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.570
Y-Yes!

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.610
Hang in there. You're going to be all right.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:19.570
I'm beginning to understand how the enemy is coordinating this.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.530
Now it's my turn!

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.570
I'm not so naïve as to allow the enemy time to act.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.280
– Summoning Jutsu! – Summoning Jutsu!

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.190
No way. Don't tell me…

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.400
This is…

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.400
The past members of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist!

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.900
Haku once told me,

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.570
when a person has something precious they want to protect…

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.360
they can truly become strong.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.900
Oh really? So do you feel the same way?

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.690
Yeah, watching Haku and Zabuza made me feel that way.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.820
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The First and Last Opponent"

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.110
THE FIRST AND LAST OPPONENT I liked those guys.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.150
THE FIRST AND LAST OPPONENT

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.480
Tune in again!
