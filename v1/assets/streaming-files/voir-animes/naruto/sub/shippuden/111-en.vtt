WEBVTT

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.960
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.050
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.470
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.390
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.190
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.490
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.700
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.330
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:59.960
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.960
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.130
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:15.350
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.850

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.970
"Decryption" HIDDEN LEAF INTEL DIVISION

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.930
Initially, Jiraiya-boy's purpose was to gather intelligence.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.830
It appears he never intended to battle Pain.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.570
But Pain's abilities far exceeded his imagination.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.270
Unless we knew the scope of his powers,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.130
no one would ever be able to defeat Pain.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.100
Jiraiya-boy went beyond his own limits,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.330
and almost managed to uncover Pain's secrets.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.770
No one but Jiraiya-boy could have gotten as far.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.800
On top of that... He could have escaped if he chose to.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.070
Instead he sacrificed his life to leave this coded message.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.130
He entrusted the rest to you all.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.700
This frog supposedly contains a captured Hidden Rain Ninja.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.300
We received prior notice from Lord Jiraiya.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.070
Now, grow.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.900
Be as rough as you need to be.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.200
Get everything you can from him!

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.730
I intend to.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.500
AUTOPSY ROOM 3 SHIZUNE OYONE KUMADORI

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.900
This is one of the three crucial sources of data Lord Jiraiya left us.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.270
We must learn everything we can from it.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.030
- Yes, Ma'am! - Yes, Ma'am!

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.130
All right. Let's begin.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.100
You haven't said a word. You see something, right?

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.600
I talked to Lady Hokage and Kakashi Sensei,

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.870
but neither of them had any clue.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.270
That means Lord Jiraiya probably left this message with you in mind.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.600
No, I'm positive he did.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.830
There's got to be something there.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.670
If anything pops up in your mind, tell us.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.730
We're not asking you to instantly decode the message.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.000
There is one thing that's been bothering me since I first saw this.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.870
What is it?
Well...

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.230
There's all these numbers.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.230
So what's with this one katakana letter?

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.230
Huh?

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.330
Katakana?

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.030
Where do you see that?

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.030
Right here.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.630
What are you talking about? Isn't that the number "9"?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.300
That's what I thought at first...

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.530
But this is not the number "9."

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.230
It's the katakana letter "ta."

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.930
What?

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.870
Well, I guess you could look at it that way.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.300
But I think that's a big stretch.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.530
I wonder...

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.030
Uzumaki, what made you think this nine was the katakana letter "ta"?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.230
Well... Pervy Sage was writing books all the time...

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.370
He was an author, after all.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.570
And I traveled all over with him.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.570
He always made me read his handwritten drafts,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.730
and asked what I thought about them.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.370
They were really boring though...

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.030
What the heck?

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.370
What's "Nine-ctics"?

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.770
And whenever there was the letter "ta," it was hard to read

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.100
because it would look like the number nine.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.770
I see... A penmanship quirk!

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.470
That was his habit, huh?

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.970
So what you're saying is...

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.370
When writing the katakana "ta,"

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.370
Lord Jiraiya had a habit of shortening his first stroke.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.500
So the first and third strokes get connected.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.730
And since he rounds his second stroke,

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.000
it looks like the number nine.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.930
Found it.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.400
Let's see...

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.400
This is a sample of Lord Jiraiya's writing.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.500
It's the same!

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.170
Lord Jiraiya knew that Naruto would remember

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.370
his habit of writing the katakana "ta" like the number nine.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.100
Frankly, this was the common link between Lord Jiraiya and Naruto.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.970
Why didn't you mention such an important thing sooner?!

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.830
Well, what's the big deal about knowing that it's the letter "ta"?

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.100
That's it!

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.100
It's when you were reading Lord Jiraiya's manuscript

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.600
that you found out about his writing habit.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.470
Then the code refers to that book you were reading!

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.800
Book?

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.430
That's it, Shikamaru!

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.000
Right! Frankly, Lord Jiraiya's book must contain a hint.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.170
Those numbers must represent

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.030
character numbers, line numbers or page numbers.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.030
I'm certain they hold the key to the code.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.230
Naruto, which book is it?

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.330
Umm... Hmm... Make-Out... What was it?

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.000
Well then, how many of Lord Jiraiya's books have been published?

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.230
I'm not sure... Four? Five?

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.900
Then let's just check all of them!

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.270
It's probably this one.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.100
MAKE-OUT TACTICS Make-Out Tactics...

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.770
- "Ta"?! - "Ta"?!

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.300
Kakashi Sensei!

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.400
It's been on my mind,

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.630
so I decided to stop by when I overheard your voices.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.630
I think I caught most of it.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.970
This is the book you're looking for.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.100
"Make-Out Tactics."

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.800
That's right.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.230
That's the one Pervy Sage was working on during our training.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.270
I see... Only Naruto would've known that.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.800
So Lord Jiraiya did pass the key on to Naruto.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.370
Uh-huh!

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.900
This "ta" is the first character in the code.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.530
Of Lord Jiraiya's books, this is the only title that begins with "ta."

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.600
When a character is used in a code,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.430
it could signify word placement or line number,

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.670
but the established protocol is to check the page number first.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.270
So...the numbers separated by commas

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.970
are 31, 8, 106, 7, 207, and 15. Six sets.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.700
Meaning there are six pages worth of information.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.000
Let's start with page 31.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.830
Flip to that page, please.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.170
Page 31...

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.100
Okay, here it is.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.170
Where do we look next?

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.770
In situations like this,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.430
we look at the first character on the page.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.400
Please read the sentence out loud starting from the top.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.570
Wha-?

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.170
No... I mean...

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.670
What is it?! Hurry up and read!

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.070
Hurry it up!

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:55.170
"I-I-I...really... love you."

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.770
CIPHER DIVISION

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.100
There! We now have all six pages.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:09.530
Well?

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.130
If I read the first characters of the code in order...

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:19.770
The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them... That's what it says.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.130
What does that mean?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.130
I don't know.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.670
We ought to relay this to Lord Fukasaku.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.600
He fought with Pain, so he may know something.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.870
Then let's go right away to the Lady Hokage

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.000
to ask this Lord Fukasaku to come.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.900
May I come along?

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.030
Yeah, please do, Shiho.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.530
Yes, sir!

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.070
All right! Let's go let Granny know!

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.000
"The-Real-One's-Not-Among-Them."

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.600
Well, Geezer Sage?! Anything?

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.770
Of those six, not a single one reminds me of Nagato.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.570
Yet a completely unrelated Pain knew of a conversation

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.600
that the Rinnegan-bearing Nagato and I shared alone.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.670
The faces are different, but I definitely sense Nagato in them.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.970
I don't know... This alone is too vague.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.930
But there's something?

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.970
I've already told you what I know about Pain.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.430
Even if he dies, he can resurrect himself.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.430
So I can't say just from speculations.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.130
Under such conditions, taking Pain on is too dangerous.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.970
We must uncover all his secrets first.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.570
What about the other sources of information?

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.070
How are the autopsy and interrogation coming along?

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.300
It looks like they will take more time.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.130
Like how long?

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.870
I can't say.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.230
Oh, come on! We can't be wasting time right now!

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.070
Interrogation aside,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:05.630
an autopsy requires minute cell and tissue analyses!

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.570
These things take time!

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.370
It'll be a week at the soonest.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.830
That long...?

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.430
Now, Uzumaki... Don't be so disappointed.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.670
So what should we do, Lady Hokage?

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.230
Shizune is heading up the autopsy...

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.630
It should be quicker than usual.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.530
Still, we have no choice but to wait.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.000
I'll go and make them speed it up.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.330
Naruto! You get in Master Shizune's way,

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.670
and I'll give you a beating!

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.800
I will avenge Pervy Sage!

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.670
I can't just sit around doing nothing!

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.670
But Naruto-boy...

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.600
Even if we decoded the message, it has nothing to do with you.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.200
Just what do you mean by that?!

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.070
In any case, at this point, you couldn't beat Pain.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.300
What?!

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.500
Tell me. Even Jiraiya-boy couldn't beat this opponent.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.500
Are you saying you're confident you can?

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.230
Well...

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:17.000
If you were to fight him now, you'd die a senseless death.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.370
Then Geezer Sage, are you telling me

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.170
to forget about avenging the Pervy Sage?

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.170
No such thing.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.370
Being asked to come was quite opportune.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:32.630
I was planning on coming to get you, Naruto-boy.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.470
How about it, Naruto-boy?

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.900
Want to train in Sage Jutsu under my guidance?

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.900
Sage Jutsu training?

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.330
I see...

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.300
Naruto learning Sage Jutsu. That is a great plan.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.700
Is Sage Jutsu really that awesome?

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.830
Yes. Lord Jiraiya was the only one capable of using it in this village.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.600
Pain defeated Jiraiya

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.030
who had summoned Lord Fukasaku and Lady Shima.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.600
What that means is...

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.030
At this point, no one in the Leaf Village can defeat Pain.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.400
I am just as mortified...

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.370
I, too, want to avenge the death of my student Jiraiya-boy.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.900
I believe that the only one who can do that is you, Naruto-boy.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.570
Me...?

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.470
You want to avenge Jiraiya-boy, don't you?

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.230
Of course I do!

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.370
Then come with me.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.370
I'll train you in Sage Jutsu at Mount Myoboku.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.100
Everything that I drove into Jiraiya-boy,

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.500
I will do the same with you.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.600
Will it let me win against Pain?!

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.270
That I can't guarantee.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.900
It all depends on you, Naruto-boy.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.570
Is that fine with you, Tsunade?

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.700
Of course... Naruto, go.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.670
Sage Jutsu training is more rigorous than you can ever imagine.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.930
Are you up to it?

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.600
Pervy Sage did it, right?

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.370
Then I can't lose to him! I'll do it!

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.600
An entrusted student... The Child of Prophecy.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.330
Nicely said!

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.070
Then, let us go.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.430
Naruto-boy, say your goodbyes.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.900
I'm off.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.670
I'm counting on you with the code, Shikamaru.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.500
Don't worry about us.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.630
I will contact you

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.300
the moment the results of the autopsy and interrogation are in.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.400
I will leave the messenger frog behind.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.270
If there's anything, give it to him.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.200
Yes sir.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.730
Good luck, Naruto!

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.730
Right!

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.630
All right! Let's go!

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:48.130
By the way, which way is Mount Myoboku?

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.000
Can we really trust this guy?

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.800
It takes a month to get there on foot.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.930
It's also known as Maze Mountain.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.270
If you don't know the secret route, you won't be able to get there.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.030
It's hard just to get there, eh?

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.170
Naruto-boy...

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.230
You already signed a binding contract with us toads.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.330
There's no need to worry.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.900
Hey! That's the...

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.630
Well then, I'll be borrowing this boy.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.600
Please take care of him.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.670
But what do you mean, there's no need to worry?

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:26.800
He disappeared?

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.230
It's a Reverse Summoning.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:29.900
Wow...

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.300
Good luck on your end too.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.130
All right!

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.970
Let's concentrate on figuring out the data Jiraiya left us.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:42.930
Roger.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:51.630
The fact that the Great Lord Elder prophesied Jiraiya writing those books...

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.770
It may have been intended to enable him

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.230
to eventually leave the encrypted message.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.000
Meaning the prophecy may all be real.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.030
In which case, Naruto Uzumaki...

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.300
He truly is the Child of Prophecy...

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.300
Where...are we?

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.030
Geezer Sage... What is this place?

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.170
The Land of Toad.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.300
The Land of Toad?

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.770
Naruto!

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.130
Gamakichi!

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.830
I summoned you here, Naruto.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.730
I see... Is that how?

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.500
Before we train, we must eat. Come along.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.270
Food?!

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:53.330
Now, eat up! I went all out to prepare this meal!

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.470
Now, now... Don't be shy.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.200
Try these caterpillars.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.900
Th-Thank you...

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.200
Ma will have a fit if she sees you like this.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.700
I forced it all down, didn't I?!

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.430
When you're hungry, your belly isn't choosy.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.070
You'll get used to it in time.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.730
By that time... I'll no longer be a human being.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.500
Now let's begin your training.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.830
Yes sir!

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.630
First of all, I must explain that

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.400
what I'm about to teach you is not ninjutsu, but Sage Jutsu.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.570
Explain?

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.070
Listen well... As opposed to ninjutsu,

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.900
where you utilize your own internal energy,

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.270
Sage Jutsu involves taking in outside energy for your use.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.630
Outside? What do you mean?

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.670
As you're probably aware,

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:24.800
Ninjutsu utilizes chakra that is molded from one's Mental and Physical Energy.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.600
Sage Jutsu involves

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.470
NIN SAGE taking that internally generated chakra

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.700
MENTAL PHYSICAL and adding Nature Energy from the outside,

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.800
resulting in an even more powerful chakra.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.230
MENTAL PHYSICAL NATURE And that leads to all your ninjutsu, genjutsu,

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.900
and even your taijutsu getting a real power boost.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.870
Mental and Physical Energy within oneself,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.300
and Nature Energy from the outside.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.630
Jutsu and techniques born from the chakra

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.470
created by these three combined energies is what's known as Sage Jutsu.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.600
Hmm...

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.400
Look at it this way...

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.670
If you add mint flavor to chocolate-vanilla ice cream,

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.270
then it tastes even better.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.730
That makes it more confusing, Gamakichi!

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.570
Oh... I get it!

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.870
You understood that analogy?

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.400
That's the kind of guy Naruto is.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.900
So what's this Nature Energy really about?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.270
Energy that is external to you.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.700
The energy that exists in the atmosphere and the terrain.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.270
Atmosphere and terrain... Okay...

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.730
As in, the air and in the ground.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.170
Oh, is that what he meant?

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:42.030
Bah! Enough words. I will show you.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.970
This should be good enough.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.570
Wow! Lord Fukasaku is amazing!

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.070
Look at him gather all that Nature Energy!

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.170
Where? Where?!

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.500
Oh, wow...

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.300
H-He lifted it!

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.670
How about that?

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.670
This is the power of Nature Energy-enhanced Sage Jutsu.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.400
But I don't know what you did...

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.470
I only saw you weave a sign at the beginning.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.900
Well, naturally.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.600
Right now, you're not yet able to sense Nature Energy, Naruto-boy.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.670
So it's impossible for you to absorb it.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.100
Then how do I do it?

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.800
You must become one with nature!

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.570
Become one...?

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.870
As in, you have to die.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:04.400
What?

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.930
Naruto engages in Sage Jutsu training at Mount Myoboku.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.800
Being much different from ninjutsu,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.330
Naruto struggles with the training.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.170
Fukasaku then reveals what it takes to become a Sage.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.100
Encouraged by the path taken by his master,

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.470
Naruto shows he has the guts to never give up.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:59.230
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The First Challenge"

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.670
All right! I'll do this!

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.700
Tune in again!
