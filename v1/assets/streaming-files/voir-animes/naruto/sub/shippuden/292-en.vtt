WEBVTT

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.040
I won't let you get away…Gengo!

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.280
Dawn

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.920
To think, Shikamaru had this many reinforcements

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.300
waiting in the wings.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.930
As expected of a coward like him.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.800
I think you're misunderstanding something, so I'm going to set you right.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.720
We barged in on our own.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.890
Shikamaru is hiding something.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.480
Yes.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.940
It must be serious, for him to act alone.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.740
Will you look into it, Temari?

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.860
Use as much manpower as necessary.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.070
Are you sure?

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.910
Shikamaru is a Leaf shinobi.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.410
Sand or Leaf… The age of drawing lines is over.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.540
A man who is essential to the Alliance is worth it.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.130
Besides…

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.840
I doubt the Hokage would willingly give us intel.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.630
I'll drag it out of him.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.470
I know you understand, but do it as peacefully as possible.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.560
Sure, I'll do it as peacefully…

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.850
as I can.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.770
And…?

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.020
Is there something else you needed to ask me?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.230
Shikamaru is now…

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.080
Anyway, we rushed over

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.950
after hearing that Shikamaru was in trouble.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.910
Out of friendship, right?

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.620
That brings a tear to my eye.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.960
Well, wait.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.380
I'll make you cry so hard, you'll hate it.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.630
Leave Sai to me.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.380
He's strong, you know.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.640
Yeah, I know.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.850
Sorry, Ino, but you're no match for me.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.060
Let me take the old man!

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.810
Oh?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.860
Wind Scythe Jutsu!

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.660
Wow, that was a surprise.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.750
But you won't get me a second time!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.840
I shall show no mercy, even if you are just a brat!

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.460
Expansion Jutsu!

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.010
What?!

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.340
Who did you just call a brat?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.020
Your name is Soku, right?

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.270
You should be supporting Shikamaru.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.860
So, what the hell are you doing?!

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.440
Like, I simply chose my master

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.360
in order to realize my full potential.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.820
What?

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.030
Like, staying under a weakling like Shikamaru

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.870
is too tedious and futile!

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.040
Damn!

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.040
Aim more carefully next time.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.630
If you miss again… you'll lose.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.640
You will definitely accept my will, Shikamaru.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.440
Your head's nothing but a flower garden!

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.480
Resign yourself…

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.820
It's all too late.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.530
Too late?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.740
What the hell do you mean?!

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.620
Not bad!

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.620
But if you're already out of breath against one opponent,

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.710
you don't have a chance.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.130
Sai, wake up!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.460
Why don't you worry about yourself instead of me?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.920
"I don't even know myself anymore…"

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.930
That's what you supposedly wrote in the last missive you sent.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.810
I have the will that Lord Gengo bestowed upon me.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.100
So…I'm not lost anymore!

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.900
Oh…

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.160
Did I overdo it?

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.030
His chakra's not reacting…

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.870
No way… Did he die?

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:12.260
You could say that making my target misread chakra is my specialty.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.730
I have no idea what you're saying…

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.770
Shikamaru should be kneeling before Lord Gengo about now.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.780
Shikamaru would never… What brute strength!

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.280
…bow down to anyone!

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.490
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.040
Why you—!

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.010
Take this!

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.940
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.590
I'll never give up...

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.920
on a precious friend!

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:36.560
Around now, your precious friend should be receiving Lord Gengo's will.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.730
Even as you lay your life on the line.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.770
You don't understand, do you?

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.980
The precious friend I'm talking about…

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.020
is you!

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.860
You belong to the Hidden Leaf.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.400
Don't ever forget that!

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.530
Being friends is useless!

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.240
Then…

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.790
Then what's that on your cheek?

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.710
Mind Transmission Jutsu!

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.590
Let me take over your mind for a little while.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.320
I didn't lure you in here

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.860
just to prevent you from using your shadows.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.740
When a human loses the ability to see and smell,

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.660
his sense of hearing becomes much sharper.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.660
Giving you an even greater advantage, huh?

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:47.830
In the shinobi world, you're either the user or the used.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.550
What're you talking about?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.340
Words from a shinobi that I once believed in…

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.350
Surely, even you've heard the name Zabuza Momochi.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.890
Zabuza…

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.270
Wasn't he the instigator of the Mizukage assassination incident?

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.900
After the failed coup d'état, we deserted the village.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.730
We had faith in Zabuza's promise

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.860
to return some day to create the ideal society.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.910
But the hardships of wandering took its toll and changed him.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.990
And so, I used Zabuza instead.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.540
Just as he had taught.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.540
To put it bluntly, you sold out your friend.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.340
And I settled here with my comrades.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.420
In order to create the ideal society that Zabuza could not.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.220
And now, it's finally becoming a reality.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.850
Don't you want to usher in that moment with me?

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.270
No thanks!

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.980
The only society I'll sacrifice my life to protect

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.980
is the Hidden Leaf!

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.150
The same way that your father and mentor did?

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.700
You have no right to talk about my dad or Asuma!

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.740
I'll tear down your ideals!

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160
What has happened…to me?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.540
You are…?

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.840
Like, my head is throbbing…

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.630
That's guy's… the only one left.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.260
Sai...answer me!

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.770
Sai!

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.390
Sai!

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.980
Who are you?

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.270
I'm your friend.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.900
No… They are my only friends.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.490
That's just what that guy Gengo made you believe!

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.490
Don't come any closer! Go away!

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.100
Let's go back together, Sai.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.810
Everyone is waiting for you.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.020
Sai… Sai!

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.990
Ino?

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.950
You're back!

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.070
Where is Shikamaru?!

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.040
Shikamaru went after that Gengo guy.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.500
That's not good!

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.960
I have to let Shikamaru know right away!

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.040
No matter what happens… He can't turn around!

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.840
Is the Hidden Leaf that important to you?

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.220
Damned right it is!

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.470
Then I'll let you in on something good…

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.940
Do you think that I only isolated myself in this region

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.400
and did nothing else?

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.610
What would you think

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.900
if I've sent my initiates with the will I bestowed upon them,

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.400
into all of the Hidden Villages?

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.660
The people of the Five Great Nations aren't blind.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.660
Your people may have infiltrated the core,

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.500
but they'll get caught in time.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.540
I'm talking about the citizens…

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.840
The safety of those who are most dear to you…

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.550
What did you say?

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.340
One signal from me, and they will create an incident.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.800
You don't have the means to stop it.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.850
You're bluffing!

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.640
In time, you'll see if I'm lying or not.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.270
Stop! Don't you dare touch Mirai!

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.860
Big Brother Shika!

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.480
Mirai!

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.530
Y-You can't fool me…

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.570
I've already figured out that you infuse chakra into your voice

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.200
to manipulate people.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:56.250
The more you resist with your mind, the more the heart seeks it.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.460
Big Brother Shika!

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.710
Mirai!

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.880
You'll pay if you lay a hand on Mirai…

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.930
I'll make sure your breath is completely snuffed out.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:15.100
Kill… Kill… – Gengo, you're dangerous. – Kill… Kill…

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.400
I can't let you go on living.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.860
This is to protect the Hidden Leaf!

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.650
– It's for that reason that... – Kill… Kill…

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.990
I've come to carry out a mission that's not like me!

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.910
– In order to make Naruto the Hokage! – Kill… Kill…

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.710
Naruto…

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.350
Ramen!

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:54.930
Huh?

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.810
What the hell was that?

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.810
What's the matter, Shikamaru?

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.860
Now, confront the darkness that consumes your heart!

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:16.080
I-I have to get it right the next time.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:21.920
Look, you're just a brat, so it's okay if you ease up a little.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.840
But it's my fault that my friends…

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.760
Thinking about your friends is important.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.010
But you don't have to take on all that responsibility.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.850
'Cuz it's a drag.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.440
Why?

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.900
Why doesn't my jutsu work on you?

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.450
Your heart is full of cracks!

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.320
Yeah... My heart is full of cracks…

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.620
In fact, it's nothing but one big crack.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.290
I-Impossible!

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.210
Your words don't have any effect on me anymore.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.840
I finally understand.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.380
Earlier, you said you came to this land with your comrades.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.090
But why isn't there a single comrade standing beside you?

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.470
You probably killed them all, and hid them in this castle, right?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.020
You're all alone,

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.690
because you only believe in using others or being used.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.610
This place is like peering deep into your heart!

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.030
You and I are alike!

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.370
We're smart, we can't trust anyone!

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.870
Don't lump me in with you!

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.870
You—!

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.460
Looks like you're still conscious!

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.920
Yeah, but it was touch and go for a little while.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.880
Ro, Soku!

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.970
Let's go.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.100
Okay, let's clean this up quickly!

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.770
Why don't we leave it to them this time?

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.390
Yeah, you're right…

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.400
Shikamaru did just call on those two.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:19.240
A clone?!

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.370
That's right. With his chakra—!

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.710
Enveloping his shadow with chakra?!

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.670
Which one is real?

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.760
I can't...move!

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.350
If you stop me, the world of the shinobi will decline!

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.930
Don't you care if you're consigned

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.600
to a life of servitude under the Feudal Lords?

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:50.070
A place where even the easygoing can live in their own way…

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.990
That's the kind of world I want to protect!

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.450
How stupid!

00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:00.160
I will not let you interfere with my vision!

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.540
Like, the chakra flowing to your tongue's been cut off…

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.920
Mission…complete!

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.970
Good work.

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.510
We'll be taking Gengo and his revolutionaries

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.020
back to the Hidden Leaf Village now.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.020
Will you be joining us?

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.850
We…

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.110
You came to the rescue again.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.900
Sheesh...

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.820
You really are something, Naruto.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.200
You guys!

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.920
What? Did you forget something?

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.460
Like, we were told we're on a mission

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.800
until we get back to the village.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.710
We shall accompany you, Lord Shikamaru.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.880
Huh? Oh, yeah?

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.970
Senpai!

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.680
Yurito?!

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.810
You came too?

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.100
I finally got to handle a big assignment!

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.770
O-Oh…

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.610
Huh? Senpai, aren't you being too stiff and formal again?

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.740
Clouds! The clouds! Remember, the clouds!

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.660
Oh, yeah…

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.620
Anyways, I'm busy, so 'scuse me!

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.290
Lord Shikamaru?

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.920
You can reach out to try and grab the cloud…

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.300
but you can never grasp it.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.630
If there's wind, it'll blow away.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.590
Such a strange thing with no core.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.850
Temari… Huh? What is it?

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.810
Well… It's nothing important, but…

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.730
Um… What is it?

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:52.940
Spit it out.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.490
Go a bit easier when you slap people, will you?

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.360
If you space out again, I'll slap you as much as I want to!

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.200
Okay… I'm counting on you for that.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.870
Thanks…for what you did this time.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.750
Is this an awkward conversation or what?!

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.670
Just hurry and ask her on a date!

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800
There, there…

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.170
Ino…

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.880
Sai?

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.800
Thanks, beautiful.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.510
I really felt…your kindness.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.020
Beautiful? Oh…uh!

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.310
I want to thank you…

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.440
That's if you'd let me.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:38.860
Oh… Well then… Maybe a d-date…?

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.160
Ino, now you're being awkward.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.780
Maybe…next time…we can…

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.620
go get a bite to eat.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.700
You mean, a date?

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.660
Huh?

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.960
Are you asking me out on a date?

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.420
Well, yeah.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.960
I see. A date, huh.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.800
You don't want to?

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:03.930
That's not it.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.760
Huh? Uh?

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.560
Be prepared.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.730
A date with me can be quite a drag.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.770
Do you have a plan?

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.110
Huh?

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.860
Like, a date strategy.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.400
Like I'd have one!

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.030
Going on a first date without a strategy

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.870
is like fighting a Tailed Beast unarmed.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.250
You have zero chance of winning.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.790
What would you two know?!

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.330
What are you saying?!

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.090
I do know a thing or two about relationships.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.000
You must first find out everything you can

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.840
about Lady Temari's likes and dislikes…

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.130
and come up with a careful plan.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.220
And you need at least three contingency plans:

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.850
one for a sunny day, a cloudy day and a rainy day!

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.470
Prepare small talk that won't bore her.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.810
Have at least a hundred stories in your arsenal.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.440
Hey, hey!

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.990
That's even more of a drag than taking Gengo down!

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.900
"Shikamaru's Story, A Cloud Drifting in the Silent Dark" The End

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.670
The day of Naruto and Hinata's wedding draws near,

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.800
but I sent everyone out on secret missions!

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:51.010
It's to get them wedding presents,

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.810
but it seems it's turning out to be surprisingly difficult.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.310
The secret behind this mission is…

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.060
something I can't talk about!

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.600
Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:08.760
“Hidden Leaf Story, The Perfect Day for a Wedding, Part 1: Naruto's Wedding”

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:28.420
