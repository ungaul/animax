WEBVTT

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.330
That's…

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.870
He's…

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.780
Madara…!

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.830
It's just like you…to have defied the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.410
More importantly, what's taking so long?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.410
Why? Why is that Madara over here?

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.200
Madara? You mean that Madara?

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.200
He's a Shadow Clone too…

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.870
Where's the real one, Obito?

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.080
Hey, Naruto!

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.370
Him being here must mean…

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.950
What's happened to everyone over there?

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.580
Brother…

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.280
He's over there, eh?

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.780
I asked you what happened?!

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.200
I'm not sure, but I suspect…

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.450
…that none of them are doing too well.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.410
Obito and Madara

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.620
Summoning…Jutsu…!

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.410
Lady Tsunade!

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.990
Katsuyu… Do something for me…

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.330
Yes! I'll fuse your body right away… No…

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.200
My lower body can wait.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.200
First…

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.490
Bring the other Kage…to me…

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.990
I…can…still save them.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.910
Faster than the Curse Mark Chains can wrap around!

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.410
I'll return that to you. It's yours to begin with.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.370
Finally, I can move!

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.160
Thanks, Naruto!

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.030
Now, it's my turn!

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.780
Obito, did you launch the plan haphazardly

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.200
before you even took in the Eight and Nine Tails?

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.200
He knows about the plan…

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.410
What's their relationship?

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.200
You were hasty, Obito.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.370
Is that also why I was revived in this form?

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.870
Well, knowing you… I'm sure you have something in mind.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.240
What have you been up to all this time?

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.580
Where's Nagato?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.620
You were supposed to determine the appropriate moment

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.370
and bring me back to life with Rinne Rebirth.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.830
That was the agreement.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.030
Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.370
Nagato's Visual Prowess is the jutsu that controls life and death.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.030
He is the seventh Pain.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.660
You tried to take advantage of Nagato?!

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.030
He betrayed us.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.450
He used the jutsu to revive the Leaf villagers.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.490
I can't depend on any of you.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.620
Well, no matter… It's still not too late.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.990
I'll capture the Eight and Nine Tails!

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.830
Dead men shouldn't go around messing things up!

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.740
Huh?!

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.240
It didn't explode?!

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.330
Uchiha Reflection.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.660
I'll get the Eight and Nine Tails.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.280
Obito, you take down those two.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.330
Obito… What happened to you?

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.780
Why would you join up with him?

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.240
Am I…dead?

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.910
Where am I?

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.410
In between this life and the next… young Uchiha.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.200
Those eyes!

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.950
No way, Gramps… You're an Uchiha too?

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.160
Well, perhaps.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.200
He rescued me?

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.910
But wait…

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.830
You said we're between this life and the next.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.030
Where are we?

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.780
It's dark and I can't see so well.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.410
Anyways, who are you, Gramps?

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.240
Heh, Don't tell me you're Death!

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.280
The guy who escorts people to heaven or hell…

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.120
Nooo!

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.200
I don't want to die yet! Help!

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.120
I just saw a scythe or something!

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.030
You're Death for sure!

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.870
One especially for the Uchiha!

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.200
Wait! I lived my life under a creed of helping elderly people in need!

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.120
Sure, I caused a lot of mischief and broke a lot of rules….

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.530
But I'm sure my scale tips on the positive side!

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.200
Please don't take me to hell!

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.450
Oww…

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.490
The fact that you feel pain means you're still alive.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.410
However, it's a miracle that you survived.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.910
I'm amazed you weren't completely crushed under those boulders.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.450
It's almost as if you passed right through them.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.280
Where did you find me?

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.870
In an underground passageway I had created…

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.660
collapsed next to crumbled rock.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.580
Still, half your body had been crushed.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.120
I patched you up as best I could.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.200
So you saved me, Gramps.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.030
Thank you.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.740
It's too soon to thank me.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.870
I expect you to repay your debt to me.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.370
After all, helping the elderly is your motto, right?

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.910
Well, yeah.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.120
So what do you want me to do?

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.660
Help you with bathroom stuff?

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.030
That would be good.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.450
Sorry, but I can't stay here forever!

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.160
Now that I know I'm alive,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.830
I'm going back home to the Hidden Leaf Village!

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.200
There's a war going on.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.530
My Sharingan's finally awakened…

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.120
So now, I'll be able to protect my comrades even better!

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.240
Protect your comrades better, eh…?

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.950
What is it?

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.910
With that body… your life as a shinobi is over.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.030
No, no, no!

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.030
Finally… I finally got this eye!

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.660
I'm confident my attack combinations will be better now!

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.240
I thought so.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.990
The scent has been completely erased.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.200
We'll have to locate him

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.490
by the slightest movement and noise he makes.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.780
W-Where is he?

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.830
Obito, behind you!

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.580
Kakashi!
My eye…!

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.410
Hey, Kakashi! Are you all right?!

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.240
Even if he's just a kid, it doesn't hurt to be cautious.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.280
I'll take it nice and slow.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.450
Our enemy… He's good.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.990
He threw away the kunai knife stained with the smell of my blood.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.780
Don't tell me you got dust in your eye again?

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.830
A ninja shouldn't cry…

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.990
I'm not dead yet.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.490
If that was now…

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.950
I wouldn't have let that happen to Kakashi…

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.030
Die!

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.240
W-Why… There's no way you could see…

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.780
Obito… You…!

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.280
W-What is…that eye?

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.370
This time…I'll protect my comrade!

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.410
You're surprisingly stubborn.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.490
Hmm…. They're all so pathetic.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.030
The flow of Rin's chakra is disturbed…

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.370
It's different from your chakra or mine.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.330
She's probably under a genjutsu…

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.950
They didn't waste any time trying to get the information out of her.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.370
We fought him earlier. He's fast… Stay alert!

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.410
Right!

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.410
And…

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.910
At last, I'll be a shinobi who can protect his comrades.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.530
Wake up to reality.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.330
Nothing ever goes as planned in this world.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.330
The longer you live, the more you realize that

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:02.700
only pain, suffering, and futility exist in this reality.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.740
What's with this old man…?

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:11.330
Listen to me… In this world, wherever there is light,

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.370
there are always shadows.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.450
As long as there is a concept of victors,

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.370
the vanquished will also exist.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.410
The selfish desire for peace gives rise to war.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.410
And hatred is born in order to protect love.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.740
These are all nexuses,

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.160
causal relationships that cannot be separated.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:35.160
Normally, that is.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.370
The old man's on a roll…

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.120
Old people ramble forever once they start.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.530
So…where are we anyway?

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:47.620
Because you were hurt, someone else was saved.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:49.780
Isn't that so?

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.160
This is bad! Run for the exit!

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.660
Kakashi!

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.620
Are you all right? Rin…? Kakashi…?

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.330
Obito!

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.580
Don't…

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.700
It's okay, Kakashi.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.830
I don't think I can make it…

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.620
My right side is totally crushed.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.780
I can't even feel anything…

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.990
Dammit!

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:13.280
I'm giving you…my Sharingan.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:23.330
Whatever the village may say… you are…a great jonin.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.410
That's how I really feel…

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.700
So please accept it.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.910
Kakashi… Take care of Rin.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.950
Rin, hurry, take my hand!

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.280
Rin!

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.240
Obito!

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.080
Just when Kakashi and I were… starting to get along…

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:19.120
I couldn't tell Rin that I…loved her…

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:24.990
I wish…I could've spent more time… with everyone.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.160
Shut up already!

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.160
I don't want to stay here long!

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.330
I have to…

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.780
Leave if you really want to.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.830
If you can move, that is.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.530
Wait a minute…

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.490
There's something weird about this.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.740
What's an old man with the Sharingan doing here all by himself?

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.530
If I think about it,

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.240
I know all the geezers and grannies in the Hidden Leaf Village,

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.910
and if I've never seen him around…

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.830
It means this guy is currently not a Leaf Shinobi.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.660
Which means…

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.330
Gramps… I bet…

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.990
you're a Rogue Ninja, aren't you?

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.990
Just who are you?!

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.280
I am…an Uchiha ghost.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.080
I am Madara Uchiha.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.990
M-Madara…?!

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.450
By Madara…

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.990
You mean Madara Uchiha, as in my ancestor?!

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.080
That Madara's supposed to have died ages ago!

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.910
What era are we talking about?!

00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:00.200
So you're more likely to believe that I'm Death?

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.080
I guess I am Death, in a sense…

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:11.280
For this reality, truly is hell.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.160
I'm a cheater of death who would be dead in no time…

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.240
if I weren't continuously siphoning chakra

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.080
from that Gedo Statue behind me.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.160
I'm going home!

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.990
I wouldn't bother. There are no exits here.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:46.580
In any case, neither you nor I can leave this place.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.830
At least, not with our bodies.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.450
If you move, the synthetic tissue of Hashirama

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.990
that I went to the trouble of attaching to you will peel off.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.030
Do you want to die?

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.990
There are a lot of things I'd like you to do for me,

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.080
for the rest of our lives.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.200
I went to great pains to save you.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.910
Don't rush to your death.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.120
What do you want?

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.620
What does a geezer like you want from a brat like me?!

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.870
To sever the fate of this world.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.660
A world of only victors…

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:33.240
a world of only peace… a world of only love.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.700
I will create such a world.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.030
So what! Who cares!

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.780
I just want to go back to everyone!

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:50.280
I told you, things don't go as planned.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.200
You will realize that in time.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.490
If you really want to die so badly, then go ahead.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.490
But I'll be taking that Sharingan of yours.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.200
Why do you want my eye?!

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.410
You already have your own Sharingan!

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:17.990
Actually, my original eyes are on loan to another.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.870
This one is a spare I transplanted later.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.660
I'd like to have a few more in stock…

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.410
Since I don't have a right eye yet.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.200
And only with two together can the Sharingan's true power be unleashed.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.240
Then…that means…

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.330
If I team up with Kakashi, we'll both be even stronger.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.280
Then we'll be able to protect Rin properly, together!

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.620
I definitely can't stay here.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.330
Just you wait… Kakashi… Rin!

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.370
I'm…

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.490
alive!

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.330
Hey, I was just outside and

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.950
your friends Rin and Stupid Kakashi are in a real pinch!

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:43.080
What's going on?!

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.370
They're by themselves, completely surrounded by Hidden Mist Shinobi!

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:52.910
Kakashi, you promised me! Please protect Rin!

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.280
I'll be right there!

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.080
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "I'm In Hell"

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.700
Kakashi and I will protect Rin!

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:09.240
I'M IN HELL Tune in again!
