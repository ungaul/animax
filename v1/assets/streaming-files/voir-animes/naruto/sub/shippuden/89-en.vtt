WEBVTT

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.470
He's eating the Detonation Clay, which means...

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.600
I saved the best for last! I'll kill you with this!

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.930
Tobi, get away!

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.300
Whoa, yikes! It's the C4 Karura!

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.230
Hurry...!

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.930
This was supposed to be my trump card to kill Itachi, but...

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.370
Is this a bomb too? If so...

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.500
It's huge! If this goes off...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.500
What, you're just gonna run away?!

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.370
You really think you can escape from my C4 Karura?!

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.400
It misfired...?

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.470
No... That's not it.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.000
What?!

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.770
I win!

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.830
Art is an explosion!

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.670
Sublimate!

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.930
Damn!

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.830
This can't...be happening!

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.470
Art

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.230
Now this is my greatest masterpiece!

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.270
There we go!

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.500
The C4 Karura... Super tiny, nano-sized explosives.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.170
Using the blast created from rupturing the giant Deidara,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.830
explosives too small for the human eye to see

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.030
are dispersed into the atmosphere.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.130
Any living being that inhales them

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.600
will set off explosions internally in all parts of the body.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.100
And these little explosions will destroy the body

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.170
on the cellular level...

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.200
A frightening jutsu...

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.030
I have to thank Itachi...

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.830
I've won! I've won!

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.970
My art wo-!

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.400
It seems you've exhausted your chakra...

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.900
Your reaction was slow.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.670
Those eyes...

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.670
Explosives too small for the eye to see...

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.530
But my Sharingan can distinguish a chakra by its color.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.600
The mini-bombs molded with your chakra...

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.030
They were as clear to me as a cloud of smoke.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.200
I could also tell that you were hovering

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.900
just outside the mini-bombs' blast range.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.300
So as long as I could see the explosives, escape was easy.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.730
But I saw you die from my C4...

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.570
That was my genjutsu.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.300
So that was it, after all...

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.300
I avoided your vital spot.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.100
Now tell me where Itachi is.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.800
That's why I said... "I have to thank Itachi."

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.100
A clay...clone?!

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.930
I anticipated your genjutsu. You're just like Itachi!

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.300
I never fall for the same trick twice!

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.670
Yes... Ever since the day I fought Itachi...

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.570
Don't belittle...me...or my art!

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.530
My ninjutsu is nothing but noble, refined art!

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.070
Feel my art!

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.470
You talked big... but is that all you have?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.070
It's over...!

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.030
You should take a good look at yourself.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.100
Huh?

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.830
Wh-What?!

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.230
That was close.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.100
A little later and you would've blown yourself up.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.870
I told you he was the type to die young.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.070
A genjutsu! When?!

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.170
From the very beginning.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.730
From the moment you looked into Itachi's Sharingan eye,

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.100
you were under his Genjutsu.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.500
Beautiful...

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.570
This is...art!

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.530
Damn! I became fascinated by the abilities of another?

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:47.600
That's art? No way... I refuse to acknowledge it!

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.870
I trained my left eye to counter the Sharingan.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.600
As if I'd neglect training to counter genjutsu!

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.670
This time, it's over for real! Eat my C4!

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.830
It seems you're the one lacking chakra!

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.370
You don't even have the strength left to dodge! Huh?!

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.100
Just as I thought...

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.430
Inside are the same invisible C4 explosives.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.500
Tsk! My wound hurts...

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.700
On top of that, I used up my chakra with that last attack.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.770
What a poor piece of work...!

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.030
Now what'll you do?! Hmm?

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.430
He used what's left of his Lightning Blade...

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.700
Your Lightning Blades won't reach me at this distance!

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600
It's over.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.730
Ha!

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.130
I won. I'm the winner!

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.200
My art triumphed!

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.370
Why?!

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.330
Wh-What's going on?

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.770
This is no genjutsu... But then...

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.800
How... How did he disarm my C4?

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.870
You...

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.500
Don't tell me you figured it out?

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.300
Yeah... Quite a while back...

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:48.370
When facing the Sharingan, it's basic to hide and form your seal.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.770
No matter how fast you are, these eyes will read them.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.300
Every jutsu you've used has been with Earth Style seals.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.200
My Chidori is the Lighting Style... Get it now?

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.100
So you knew, after all...

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.670
Then that Lightning Blade you used was to...

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.400
The Earth Style is vulnerable to the Lightning Style.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.800
Your explosives won't detonate against my Lightning Style.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.600
Isn't that your weakness?

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.630
You...!

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.970
I see... The Lightning Blade earlier was to run it through yourself...

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.770
and you de-triggered the C4 that had entered your body.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.100
Yeah... Thanks to that, my body's in tatters.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.000
Although the correct name for my jutsu is Chidori...

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.570
He figured out the weakness of my art in such a short time,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.900
and so accurately...

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.130
When did you realize it?

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.870
After that blow from the land mine.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.430
Although, I've been analyzing it from the very beginning...

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.670
Since I countered your first attack with Chidori Senbon.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:05.670
Among the bombs you created, some exploded and some didn't.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.200
That's when I formulated a hypothesis.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.800
Hypothesis...?

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:18.000
That time, the only one that exploded was the one you threw

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.830
when you tried to evade my attack.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.230
All the explosives that I countered with my Chidori Senbon didn't detonate.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.430
However, it was possible that you purposely didn't trigger them...

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.630
because they fell close to your comrade.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.900
In other words, you weren't sure if they didn't detonate

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.500
because of your Chidori or because I didn't make them explode.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.670
I see... So that's why you tested those two alternatives on the land mine?

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:53.730
Exactly.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.630
The key element of the C2 coordinated assault is

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.900
using the land mines to slow you down

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.170
and finishing you off with a pinpoint missile attack.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.930
Land mines are planted all around you!

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.570
Step on one and you'll set them off!

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.730
If they were self-triggered, your will was not involved.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.430
So I could test if my Lightning Style Jutsu

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.300
could disarm your Earth Style bombs.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.870
That's right. That time I stuck my sword into the ground...

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.270
I wasn't verifying the location of land mines.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.400
I shot through them with my sword tinged with Chidori

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.370
in order to confirm my theory.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.130
But...how?! How could you pinpoint the position of the landmines?!

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.630
This eye distinguishes chakra by its color.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.970
Didn't I tell you that earlier?

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.630
You could see the position of the land mines...?!

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.600
He wasn't poking into the ground to test where they were

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.970
and where he could step?

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.270
He was checking whether he could disarm the Detonation Clay...

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:09.530
But what would you have done if the land mines exploded?!

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.900
It was one or the other. But I had another back-up plan.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.930
Although I didn't have a chance to demonstrate it...

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.970
This guy... He even had another jutsu...

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.200
Where is Itachi?

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.530
You may try to look good, but you're barely managing too.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.430
It seems your chakra got drastically low.

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:14.230
I win. I still have Detonation Clay to... Huh?!

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.400
Under these conditions, shouldn't you be panicking a little?

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.630
This time, my art will kill you for sure!

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.470
That's what pisses me off about you! Both of you brothers!

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.770
Don't pretend to be so cool!

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.800
Those eyes! That overconfident eye irritates me!

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.600
As if it denies my art! It's unforgivable!

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.170
Those eyes which show absolutely no respect for my art...

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.370
Those eyes that ignore my art... are unforgivable!

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.070
I couldn't care less about such a thing.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.100
Never mind that. Tell me where Itachi is.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.830
So you've drawn back your Sharingan...

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.330
You really take me lightly!

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.670
This is my ultimate art...!

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.570
Now I will detonate myself.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.270
He's...!

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.830
With death, I will become art.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.870
This never-before-seen explosion will leave

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.730
a never-before-seen scar on this land.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:41.130
And...! My art will win never-before-seen admiration!

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:44.530
Sorry, Tobi...

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.230
In the midst of my admiration, you will definitely die!

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.030
An explosion that will cover a ten-kilometer radius...

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.630
You won't be able to get away!

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.330
Now, tremble with fear!

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.530
Be in awe! Despair!

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.970
Scream!

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.400
My art is...

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.430
Ha!

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.630
An explosion!!

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.530
Naruto, there are signs that Sasuke was just here.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.230
- What?! - It's very vague, but his scent still lingers.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.730
I'd say there was a battle here.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.170
Then let's go after Sasuke immediately!

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.570
We can't.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.630
Why not?

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.430
The scent stops here.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.300
In a case like this,

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.300
either Sasuke was erased without a trace in the explosion, or...

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:04.770
Next time: "Disappearance"

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.530
Tune in again!
