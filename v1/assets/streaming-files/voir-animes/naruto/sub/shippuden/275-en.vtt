WEBVTT

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.420
- Please make it in time! - Please make it in time!

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.960
- Rin! - Rin!

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.920
Thank you, Rin.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.670
Obito and I will be joining you shortly.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.000
We can catch up then, the three of us together.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.460
Rin…

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.630
This time, let's spend...

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.210
some alone time together.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.710
Just you and me.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.290
Kakashi would just be in the way.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.000
I'll leave him here.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.990
YOU BETTER…

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.120
Why?

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.910
I thought we had both resolved to…

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.450
Your power is still needed here!

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.120
We need to rebuild chakra again.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.080
Mother, let's teleport to the Root Time-Space…

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.660
You'll recover faster there, too.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.030
Why would you do this for someone useless like me?

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.410
Never mind that.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.120
Kakashi, be wary of the enemy.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.120
Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura…

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.830
This is a crucial time for them.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.700
Kakashi, you must survive and support the next generation.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.370
It's too soon for you to die.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.160
It's totally useless, Naruto.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.910
He's a goner.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.410
He'll rot away like trash and die.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.080
Enough, Naruto.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.580
He's right.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.830
Don't waste your chakra.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.910
Why do you sympathize with him?

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.160
He was originally your enemy, right?

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.030
Then again, he's a traitor to us now.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.830
A loser on both sides.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.620
Hated and resented by friend and foe alike,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.950
with no one to call comrade or family…

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.370
He's alone, with nothing left.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.490
He's lost everyone precious to him,

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.200
and he can't realize his dreams.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.030
And after being used up, he's helpless at the end…

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.490
He's a fool, filled with nothing but mistakes…

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.990
You've done nothing but—!

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.200
You're right…

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.030
Rin…again…

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.120
I'll create a world where we can be together again.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.700
I shall…

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
sever the nexuses…

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.200
of this world.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.030
Now go on… Until I will be revived…

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.530
You shall be…

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.870
Who are you?

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.660
I am Madara Uchiha.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.620
But a world of just victors, peace, and love…

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.700
Such a world can be created too.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.160
If you allow us to collaborate, you can learn how.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.120
Let's go, Konan… Nagato.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.280
We can't trust these guys!

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.240
Don't ever approach us again!

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.410
You'll eventually realize it too.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.780
Who are you?

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.370
You are going to be very useful to me.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.200
RIN NOHARA

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.830
Summoning Jutsu!

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.870
Minato Sensei…

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.910
I hereby declare the start of the Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.450
They each have formidable strength.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.330
And I have even more up my sleeve.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.830
So be it. We will join forces with you.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.990
They will know despair thoroughly.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.120
You're right.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.620
It's an end worthy of the criminal that I am.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.370
My Visual Prowess is back!

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.950
We've been here before!

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.990
Did she change worlds again?!

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.870
Naruto!

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.120
Naruto, I'll handle the diversions this time.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.950
He's beyond help.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:34.830
Come with me.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.030
I'm going on ahead!

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.200
Damn it! Damn it!

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.530
Damn it!

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.160
That's enough.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.280
Thank you, Naruto

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:32.010
After fighting you, I feel like I've woken up.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.760
You and I are both powerless shinobi.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.640
You…

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.220
no, I should say everyone…

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.930
will eventually end up like me.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.720
I'll never end up like you!

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.930
How many times do I have to tell you?!

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.260
My dream is to become the Hokage!

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:08.180
There is no reason to keep on fighting for a world like this.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.220
In a few minutes, this world will be gone anyway.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.390
Why do you still fight?!

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:23.010
Because it's my Ninja Way.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.180
I never go back on my word.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.300
Don't overdo it. Let's call it a day.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.050
No, I'm not giving up.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.720
Didn't I make a promise?

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.010
That I'm gonna become the Hokage!

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.640
Really…

00:12:55.010 --> 00:13:00.090
It was as if I saw my past self when I looked at you.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.180
And I regret what I am now.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.220
But for some reason, it also made me happy.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.140
As a kid, I would imagine myself as Hokage so often.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.180
That indescribable feeling of exhilaration and anxiety…

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.890
I think you brought that all back for me.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.010
Don't cry, Obito. You'll get laughed at.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.010
I know.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.010
Besides, the world of shinobi is all about fighting.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.760
It's nowhere near a peaceful world.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.760
And I'll put an end to it, no matter what.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.430
Hey, you're not the only ones.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.680
Don't forget that we're here too.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.010
Yeah, that's right.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.090
Rin… I…

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.300
What's that?

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.300
The higher-ups have decided.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.220
Obito, you're going to be the next Hokage.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.930
But you're just as qualified…

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.340
A supportive role suits me better.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.090
I'm sure Rin would say the same thing.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.140
But if you screw up, I won't hesitate

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.180
to step up as a candidate to become the next Hokage.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.510
What?!

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.010
Do your best!

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.760
RIN NOHARA

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.890
This is driving me crazy!

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.090
All this paperwork day in and day out.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.970
That can't be helped… You're the Hokage now.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:37.010
Besides, something like this sure beats having to fight every day.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.180
That's for sure.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.430
It's the Hokage!

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.050
Lord Hokage! Hello!

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.090
Lord Hokage, are you on your rounds?

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.010
Well, yes.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.260
Yeah, right!

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.220
You're just goofing off, right?

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.220
Speak for yourself!

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.390
What?!

00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:59.260
Wanna make something of it?

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.680
Cut it out!

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.010
Why did you hit only me?

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.590
Because you were rude to Lord Hokage!

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.640
Seriously… It's so peaceful, thanks to you.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.140
Not just me.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.930
It's everyone who did their best to support the village.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.640
It would be nice to talk to Rin someday.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.010
Yeah.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.800
Imagining the village, friends, and me as the Hokage…

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.260
Even after all that's happened…

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:39.760
Just the thought of it seems to fill up the hole in my heart.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.220
Maybe it's because it's the end,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.340
I find myself rambling all of a sudden.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.010
Ouch!

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.260
Don't act tough and hide your wounds.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.090
I'm always watching you.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.260
You promised me that you would become Hokage, Obito.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.720
Listen, I want to stop this war too.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.680
I really want to save the world.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:23.590
So I've decided to stick by your side and watch over you.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.430
You told me saving you

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.890
was the same as saving the world, remember?

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.090
Yeah!

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.180
Since I'm keeping an eye on you,

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.050
you can't hide anything from me anymore.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.220
Okay! Okay!

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.140
Go for it, Obito!

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.010
Become Hokage and show me how you'll save the world.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.140
That's another promise!

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.300
Let's go!

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.220
A lot more suffering likely awaits you, Naruto.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:20.090
But don't ever change and hang on to your Ninja Way.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.140
You once told me that

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:30.010
never going back on your word is your Ninja Way, right?

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.140
Yeah…

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:43.800
Naruto…

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.800
You better...

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.930
become Hokage!

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.140
Yeah!

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.180
The vermin traitor has finally died, eh?

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.840
He was vermin and persistent as a cockroach.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.890
Don't laugh at Obito!

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.510
Naruto…

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.510
Naruto… If you keep resisting,

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:11.090
you'll end up pitifully crumbling to ash just like him!

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.550
As someone who tried to become Hokage,

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.430
Obito is nothing but…

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.720
awesome to me!

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:28.680
Rin!

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.220
I've been waiting.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.220
Really?

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.180
Sorry, I made you wait.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.890
Seems you got lost along the way.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.470
Yeah…

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.300
A lot of things happened before I could come here.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.970
Rin, you know...

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.800
that promise I made to you…

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.010
No, you did your best!

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.890
I've been watching you all along!

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:09.970
Let's go!

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.240
Come on, Obito.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:55.120
Rin, do you mind waiting just a little longer?

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.830
Obito?

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.990
Only a little bit before we move on…

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.870
I'd like to make one more detour along the way.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.160
Really… Who do you want to save this time?

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.080
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Sharingan Revived"
