WEBVTT

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.270
There's no mistake.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.100
It's a hideout that Orochimaru once used.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.670
Leave it to Kabuto to take advantage of an old nest.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.630
Hold it. They're on our side.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.930
Captain Mitarashi...

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.800
I'm here to relay an order from the village.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.700
Sai is to return home and you are to continue tracking Kabuto.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.270
We are here to assist you.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.670
Yamato rushed back in the midst of a mission.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.870
Did something happen?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.730
The Akatsuki attacked the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.330
The town has been destroyed,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.400
scores of citizens have been injured and Lady Tsunade is in a coma.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.100
What?!

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.900
As a result, Lord Danzo has taken over as the Sixth Hokage.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.530
I can't believe such a thing could happen so suddenly.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.330
I will give you a more detailed account later, Captain.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.300
Sai...

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.770
I'm on my way.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.200
Sai and I spent a lot of time working together on this mission.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.630
But he remained aloof up until the end.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.600
Lord Danzo is the Hokage?

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.070
The essence of a ninja is to operate behind the scenes.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.100
However, there are times when a man who works in the shadows

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.000
must step out into the open.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.670
For me, that time is now.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.470
I hope I have your continued loyalty.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.830
- Yes sir! - Yes sir!

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.600
The Sixth Hokage Danzo

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.030
What'll I do?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.370
Huh?!

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.400
Well, the Hidden Leaf Village has tons of pretty women.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.000
And what if all those women declared their love for me?

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.730
I was wondering what I'd do.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.470
Oh yes, I see.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.000
Well, why don't you go out with them?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.770
With as many as you can get your hands on!

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.630
But...when the time comes to leave the Hidden Leaf

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.470
and they say they can't bear to part with me, what'll I do?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.630
I'd be so scared if they suggest something like a lover's suicide.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.630
So are you happy or scared? What are you trying to say?!

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.470
We haven't even reached the Hidden Leaf Village yet.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.370
Don't get so carried away! It's creepy!

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.030
But maybe some handsome guy with a super-good looking face

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.870
might come on to you too.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.200
Why can't you just say handsome guy?

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.670
Although a rich, tall, famous ninja in addition to being super-handsome

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.970
wouldn't be farfetched.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.030
No, you're letting your imagination run wild.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.300
No way that would happen! Absolutely no way!

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.400
I didn't ask...

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.900
for your opinion!

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.770
What would we do if that stone hits a boulder and it crumbles

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.330
and the falling rocks hit another bigger boulder

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.900
that causes an even bigger rockslide that falls right over

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.100
the Hidden Leaf Village and destroys it?

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.130
Who's over-imagining things now?! Idiot!

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.300
N-No way...

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.930
It can't be! I didn't mean to do this! I mean, how could a rock that size...

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.730
K-Karui, what have you done?

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.030
There's no way.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.270
Anyway, let's look for someone.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.530
Who are you three?!

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.670
I'm Samui from the Hidden Cloud.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.070
I am a messenger for the Raikage, the leader of the Hidden Cloud.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.400
Lord Raikage?

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.070
Please pardon our run-in earlier.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.530
We're all on edge lately.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.800
There weren't any guards from the Leaf around

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.630
and finding the village in such a state...

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.730
We were shocked and wondered what had happened.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.970
- It was the work of the Akatsuki. - Here's your stone

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.730
- Precautionary measures - that destroyed the village.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.470
are being taken immediately and security will be tightened.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.100
- We would like an audience - That's got nothing to do with it!

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.600
with your Hokage.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.830
I am here to deliver a letter from the Raikage to Lady Hokage.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.230
Actually...

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.170
Is something the matter?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.600
Oww!

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.870
Don't tell me this lump on my head... Enough!

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.670
Talk about bad timing.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.970
A sealed tube never contains any good news.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.070
It's a letter calling for an emergency Five Kage Summit Conference.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.870
You see? A Five Kage Summit Conference?!

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.230
Lady Hokage is in a coma?

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.670
I am her aide, so I will accept the letter on her behalf.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.070
If it's uncertain when she will regain consciousness,

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.000
the interim Hokage will do.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.070
Someone must read the letter and give me a reply!

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.330
The Raikage cannot wait.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.030
But...

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.330
That woman is no longer the Hokage.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.170
I am the new Sixth Hokage.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.800
I will look at the letter.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.470
Don't tell me that Danzo has...

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.930
What is it?

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.930
Doesn't Lord Raikage want a reply?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.530
OFFICIAL TO THE HOKAGE FROM THE RAIKAGE

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.930
Sasuke... So it has come to this.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.170
And your reply?

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.400
Ow! Hey!

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.200
What's wrong, Kiba?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.430
Now stay calm and listen!

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.630
Lady Tsunade has been relieved as the Hokage!

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.000
- What?! -Huh?

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.570
It seems someone named Danzo is the Sixth Hokage!

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.200
I don't know too much,

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.900
but apparently he's been active behind the scenes!

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.300
Danzo?!

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.130
Danzo is...

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.770
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.670
And that's not the only shocking thing!

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.930
The Sixth Hokage declared Sasuke as a Rogue Ninja,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.470
and has given the approval to hunt him down!

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.500
What the hell's going on?!

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.800
Even I don't understand.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.800
They couldn't wait until Lady Tsunade recovered.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.230
It makes sense in a way.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.430
Kakashi Sensei...

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.930
Sasuke is indeed a Rogue Ninja.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.500
Normally, he would have been eliminated long ago.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.330
It's only because of Lady Tsunade that he's been allowed to live.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.000
I'm going to see this Danzo!

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.330
Wait, Sakura!

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.630
Storming into his office will solve nothing.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.460
Lady Tsunade isn't even conscious yet! How could they do this to her?!

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.160
And what about Sasuke?

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.660
You can't expect me to keep quiet!

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.700
I'm coming with you.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.600
Calm down, you two.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.100
At a time like this,

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.930
staying calm is crucial or things won't work out.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.130
How can I stay calm?!

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.230
I won't let them lay a hand on Sasuke!

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.000
I said wait!

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.930
Danzo has already figured out that this is how you'll react.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.930
So you'll go see him, then what?

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.730
I won't do anything violent!

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.500
I just want to talk to him and ask him to change his mind about Sasuke!

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.830
I hardly think that he'll go along with whatever you have to say. Jeez!

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.500
Danzo has been appointed by the Feudal Lord.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.600
While he has yet to win a vote of confidence from the jonin,

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.960
he is the Hokage.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.530
If you make a wrong move, you'll be thrown into jail.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.060
That's fine with me!

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.500
I'm going!

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.230
Me too!

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.700
H-Hey guys... Naruto, you possess the Nine-Tails.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.600
What about it?

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.560
Danzo would like nothing better than to confine you in this village.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.100
Do you want to be locked up in jail?

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.500
That's exactly what he wants.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.430
Then you won't be able to look for Sasuke.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.100
Don't make a scene right now.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.960
You wanted to see me?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.100
Keep an eye on Naruto.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.960
If you notice anything amiss, inform me immediately.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.000
Yes sir.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.130
Umm... May I ask you a question?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
What is it?

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.130
What do you plan to do with Naruto?

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.500
Do not worry.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.930
Naruto is the village hero right now.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.930
Everyone trusts him.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.160
Even more than they trust me, the Sixth Hokage.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.300
If I do anything to Naruto now,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.730
it will affect my appearance as the Hokage.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.760
This is a crucial time, right before the vote of confidence.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.160
Still, Naruto is a Jinchuriki.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.360
As the Hokage,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.830
I must keep the Jinchuriki under surveillance.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.060
I cannot be lax like Tsunade was.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.560
I understand.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.600
You're excused.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.860
Should I be relieved?

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.830
Sai!

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.400
We were just looking for you!

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.260
We need to talk to you.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.900
What is it?

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.160
Tell us what you know about Danzo.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.200
Sai!

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.630
That's impossible.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:56.930
Why?!

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.830
Don't tell me you're working for him again!

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.930
No... It's nothing like that.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.560
It's not possible for me to say a word about Lord Danzo.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.100
Due to this.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.530
What the hell is that?

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.660
Is it a Curse Mark?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.660
Yes, it's a Curse Mark placed by Lord Danzo.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.630
If I start to talk about Lord Danzo,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.560
my entire body will become numb and I won't be able to move or talk.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.130
This is true of all who belong to the Foundation.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.600
He's a cautious man.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.460
Lord Danzo and the Foundation engage in espionage.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.230
They've done a lot of dirty work behind the scenes

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.700
in order to protect the village.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.860
This cannot be revealed.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.400
So even if one is captured, not a word will be uttered.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.500
But what a thing to do...

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.300
Putting a Curse Mark on one's own subordinate?

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.560
I can't accept that.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.460
It's what has protected Hidden Leaf Village

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.800
from the bottom up.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.630
Their methods may have been unscrupulous,

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.660
but their love for the village is no different from yours.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.630
Then why did he overturn Lady Tsunade's decision about Sasuke?

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.260
Isn't he planning to dispatch Tracking Ninja to go after Sasuke?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.060
I-Is that so?

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.530
I haven't heard anything regarding Sasuke-

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.460
You can tell us all about this Sasuke fellow!

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.200
You seem to be his friends!

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.430
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.630
Don't kill him!

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.800
I know that!

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.660
Sakura!

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.200
Are you all right, Sakura?

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.130
Judging from their headbands, they're ninja from the Hidden Cloud.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.000
Why would they come here?

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.400
What the hell do you guys want?

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.600
You were just talking about Sasuke!

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.230
Tell us what you were saying!

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.730
It's got nothing to do with you Cloud Ninja!

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.330
It's got everything to do with us!

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.330
Sasuke Uchiha of the Hidden Leaf attacked our village!

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.000
Your Rogue Ninja abducted our master!

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.930
We don't even know if our master is dead or alive, you idiots!

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.800
Th-That's a lie!

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.500
Why would Sasuke do such a thing?!

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.160
Like we'd know what the Akatsuki's motives are!

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.700
The Akatsuki?! What do you mean?

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.100
Huh?! Don't kid around!

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.860
Sasuke is a member of the Akatsuki!

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.300
You guys let your Rogue Ninja roam free,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.500
so Lord Raikage ordered us to come here.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.130
And we've gotten your Hokage's permission to get rid of the Uchiha!

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.930
Sasuke... abducted their master?

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.760
We'll get our revenge!

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.030
The Uchiha is ours!

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.730
Sasuke...

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.860
What's...happened to you?

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.230
Hey, Sasuke.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.230
I suddenly sensed his chakra.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.160
What's going on?

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.860
Aw man... Bad timing.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.400
How did you know where to find me?

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.530
Don't underestimate me.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.400
I have considerable powers.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.430
So what do you want with me now?

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.560
Taka left the Akatsuki. We're done with you.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:01.230
As it stands, you reneged on your promise to me.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.030
What are you talking about?

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.130
I'm talking about hunting the Tailed Beast.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.930
We already caught the Eight-Tails and delivered it to you.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.200
That was just a substitution.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.830
In other words, you guys failed.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.430
The Eight-Tails pulled a fast one on you.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.760
I saw it all with my Sharingan.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.130
There's no way he had an opportunity to make a clone.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.430
The only part of his body that I cut off!

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.600
Frankly, I'm disappointed in you all.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.000
So what're you going to do?

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.260
It's none of our business now.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.700
Wrong.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.930
You will finish whatever work you started as members of the Akatsuki.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.100
Having said that, you can forget about the Eight-Tails.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.200
I've decided to give you a different task.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.300
And if I refuse?

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.860
We'll fight it out right here.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.800
And you won't be able to go to Hidden Leaf Village.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.300
We'll force our way through!

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.000
It's a little too late to go to the Hidden Leaf.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.900
I went right through him.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.700
Just like before. Is this his power?

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:24.000
Your purpose is fruitless. Too bad.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.360
What do you mean?

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.930
The Village Hidden in the Leaves is no more.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.200
What are you saying?!

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.530
I'll explain it to you.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.300
Who is he?!

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.560
Relax. He's my partner.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.830
So, who is the new Hokage?

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.300
Someone named Danzo.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.000
It's pretty much what we expected.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.100
Danzo...is the Hokage?

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.360
Yes, one of the high-ranking elders of the Hidden Leaf

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.660
who drove your elder brother into a corner.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.260
He is the new Hokage.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.200
What the hell happened in the Hidden Leaf Village?!

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.560
My subordinate, Pain, destroyed the Hidden Leaf.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.960
And because both you and Pain were a bit too overbearing,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.600
it seems the five Kage are going to take action.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.230
The five Kage?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
There will be a Five Kage Summit Conference.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.130
I'll explain from here.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.660
You will tell us everything you know about Sasuke.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.060
Of course, his ninjutsu style and powers,

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.700
but also any data you have gathered about

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:42.200
the Akatsuki and Sasuke's partners, as well as their past actions.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.230
No way! It's a lie!

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.630
Sasuke wouldn't join the Akatsuki!

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.760
Are you sure about this?

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.430
Yes! The Uchiha family crest was verified!

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.760
And his facial composite matched the list.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:57.900
That's... That's not poss...

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.160
Why are you crying?! We're the ones who want to cry!

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.960
Your tears won't bring back Lord Killer Bee or Lady Yugito!

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.500
If you have time to cry, then start talking about Sasuke!

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.000
Wait, guys.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.160
Huh?!

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.160
When the authorization to terminate Sasuke was given,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.330
all Hidden Leaf data relating to him should have been passed on to you.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.730
It's not necessary to press these two any further.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.800
Oh, you're right!

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.000
Our captain is now waiting for it.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:38.400
We were just trying to get whatever other information was available!

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.400
You can't expect us to stay still!

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.060
We don't even know how our master's doing!

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.460
I will avenge Pervy Sage!

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.600
I can't just sit around doing nothing!

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.000
You're not involved in this, so you wouldn't understand how we feel!

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.660
Is your master a Jinchuriki?

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.860
How did you know?

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.830
I'm a Jinchuriki too.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.460
The Akatsuki is after the Jinchuriki.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.560
So actually, I am involved.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.530
The Akatsuki will always capture a Jinchuriki alive.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.000
That means your master may not be dead.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.060
Are you serious?!

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.000
Never mind Sasuke. You need to save your master first.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.700
Are you really sure about this?!

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.230
Really, really sure?

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.060
Didn't I tell you?!

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.630
Our master wouldn't die so easily!

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.060
I'll help you rescue your master,

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.700
and I'll give you whatever information we have on the Akatsuki.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.930
Hey blondie, you're quick to understand!

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.430
Come with us and tell us about Sasuke!

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.630
Naruto...

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.200
Leave it to me, Sakura.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.600
What's your name?

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.960
Naruto Uzumaki.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.460
I can't do it.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.460
I can't sell Sasuke out.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.030
Quit playing around!

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.630
You can't take it back now, after all that's been done.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.300
I know I'm being selfish.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.430
But at this rate, the vicious cycle of an eye for an eye will start all over again!

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.460
Your Sasuke is the one who started it all!

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.800
So where do you suggest we take our hatred?

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.600
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Five Kage Summit's Eve"

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.530
Naruto, why go this far for him?

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.660
Tune in again!
