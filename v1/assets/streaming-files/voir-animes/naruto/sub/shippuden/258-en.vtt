WEBVTT

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.480
When one who possesses the power of Rinne,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.100
should draw near the moon…

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.600
the eye that can reflect off of the moon,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.020
and grant the infinite dream shall open.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.770
Shine upon the world… Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.430
Infinite Tsukuyomi

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.010
I've used up my chakra and can't release my jutsu!

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.430
Wha—?!

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.880
What is this?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.970
It's finally started…

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.300
I'm done with this!

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.430
Then we don't need these insides anymore either.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.340
Again?!

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.720
What's all this shaking?

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.680
Over at 4 o'clock! Meteorites!

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.090
There are so many!

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.930
Brace for impact!

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.300
What's happening over there?!

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.720
That's not normal!

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.300
The chakra Naruto gave everyone has disappeared…

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.130
And so has that giant tree.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.800
Something big is happening over there, that's for sure.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.430
Most likely, it's something bad.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.970
What?!

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.510
What's the matter, Kiba?!

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.260
Shino… The moon! Look at the moon!

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.430
This can't be!

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.380
What is happening?

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.470
This is really bad.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.590
I'll pulverize all the meteorites with these next, so don't worry.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.550
You two stick close to me and stay still!

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.300
Okay!

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.340
I have to make sure I don't hit Sasuke!

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.470
Go!

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.430
Sasuke, don't head down here so suddenly!

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.380
I could've hit you with a Rasen Shuriken—!

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.340
Hey! Land more softly too!

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.470
Just shut up and stay still!

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.550
Not again!

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.430
Now! Become one!

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.550
Those eyes…

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.430
Don't tell me Madara's launched his jutsu already!

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.510
My lord, this is terrible!

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.380
Please wake up! My lord!

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.760
What is it?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.090
We are much fatigued from playing mahjong all night.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.880
Up all night? Then why were you asleep?!

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.470
Oh, never mind!

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.470
Something terrible is happening outside!

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.430
It's night, yet it's bright as day—!

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.510
This light can penetrate and see through even shadows…

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.630
No one can hide from it.

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.260
And now…

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.090
Divine…Deep Forest Emergence!

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.430
Get ahold of yourself, Tsunade!

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.260
What is going on?

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.510
I can't move!

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.550
Naruto!

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.970
Naruto, don't do it right now!

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.260
The light can't penetrate that Susano'o?

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:02.470
His Rinnegan can counter even this jutsu?

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.300
Don't go outside right now.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.930
Without this Susano'o that my eye made,

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.180
you'd get bound up in his genjutsu as well!

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.180
Also his shadows are outside…

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.470
If you and I fall, it's all over!

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.380
We need to bide our time.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.800
This is the Deep Forest Emergence!

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.340
He's binding people using the Divine Tree's life energy!

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.630
Why am I not affected?!

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.630
Yamato!

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.590
Yamato…

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.090
H-Hey? Where am I?

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.680
What happened…to me?

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.220
Are you all right, Yamato?!

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.010
Lord Third?

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.720
Well…

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.010
Motoi! Get away from here!

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.220
Yamato!

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.260
That's right! Kabuto captured me…

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.130
What's happening in the war? What's going on?

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.760
And Naruto! Is Naruto all right?!

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.470
Get yourself together!

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.010
This is—!

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.510
Let the world of dreams now begin…

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.470
A world without abysmal chakra!

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.430
I was Orochimaru's guinea pig and I was all alone…

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.300
I had no family, nothing…

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.130
Tenzo…Tenzo!

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.760
Where am I?

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.510
Tenzo! Hurry! Hurry!

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.930
Yukimi?

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.300
Tadah!

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.680
How's does this look? Tenzo?

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.300
I met Yukimi and got to know Kakashi Senpai…

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.680
And then, the place where I belonged

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.340
became the ANBU Black Ops.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.340
Hey, Tenzo.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:01.380
Kakashi Senpai?

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.680
Hurry up and get ready.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.260
We have a mission.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.470
R-Right! I'm sorry!

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.130
If I stayed in the ANBU, I wouldn't be alone.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.550
All the missions were harsh…

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.470
I had no family, so for someone like me,

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.590
it was the best place.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.340
No, that's not right!

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.220
The place where I belong, changed.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.720
Where I belong is…

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.930
But that place belongs to Kakashi…

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.430
Tenzo, what's the matter?

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.340
Huh? Oh…Kakashi Senpai?

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.550
What's happening?

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.630
Did you finally realize?

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.680
That this is where you belong.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.680
What's going on? Why are you suddenly saying that?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.760
You're—!

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.510
It's been a while, Yamato.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.510
I'll be taking Kakashi's Sharingan.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.010
Wait!

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.720
Captain Yamato!

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.010
Let's go after him!

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.340
Only Team 7 can save Kakashi Sensei!

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:40.340
You guys!

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.340
Preparations are already set!

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.180
Let's hurry!

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.630
Captain!

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.880
Captain Yamato!

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.380
Captain!

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.260
Yes, we'll pursue them immediately!

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.300
Yes… This is where I…

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.680
Damn—!

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.680
Captain Yamato!

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.260
Captain Yamato…

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.840
You're—!

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.130
Sasuke!

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.470
Sasuke?!

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.220
Chidori Stream!

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.130
Why are you—?

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.180
It's none of your business.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.470
Watch out!

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.130
Damn it! I was careless.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.180
Are you all right?!

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.760
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800
Thanks.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.880
Kakashi Senpai!

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.300
Kakashi Sensei!

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.220
Are you okay?

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.590
Yeah…I'm fine.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.380
You saving me, imagine that.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.090
No, it wasn't just me.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.130
I had help from Naruto and Sasuke…

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.180
Now, I can rest assured and leave things to you.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.470
You are the only one among my juniors that I acknowledge…

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.380
From here on, you are officially the captain of Team 7.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.340
N-No way! Team 7 is your…

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.130
No, Kakashi is right.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.430
You performed admirably.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.220
There's no one else I can entrust Team 7 to…

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.720
Lady Fifth…

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.380
Way to go, Captain Yamato!

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.340
You give me peace of mind, Captain Yamato!

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.800
To me, you were my first friend, Captain Yamato.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.380
Anyone else just won't do!

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.300
Thank you…everyone!

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.760
On top of that, Sasuke is back.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.340
I'm so happy for you… Naruto…Sakura…

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:41.010
A team approved by Kakashi… Not bad.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.760
Sasuke…

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.010
That's right…

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.090
I can stay here.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.720
From now on, this is where I belong…

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.930
From now on, this is where I belong…

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.380
Is this the Infinite Tsukuyomi?

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.220
What in the world happened?

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.970
What's going on?!

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.230
Any way you look at it, this is my room.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.730
Why is the Leaf Village—?

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.020
Does this mean we were transported here

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.430
all the way from the battlefield?

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.850
But, what's this feeling I'm feeling?

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.890
Even if we are away from the battlefield,

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.600
this is just way too peaceful!

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.680
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The World of Dreams"

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.600
What?!

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.520
What is going on?!

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:17.520
THE WORLD OF DREAMS Tune in again!
