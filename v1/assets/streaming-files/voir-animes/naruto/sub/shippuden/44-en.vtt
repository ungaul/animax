00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.270
You really don't have any manners do you, child?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.500
When you address someone who's higher-ranking than you...

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.930
it's common courtesy to show your face.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.100
He's covered with wounds...

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.900
Looks like it's over...

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.530
Naruto!

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.970
The Secret of the Battle! 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.430
All right... I'll listen to you.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.730
To tell the truth,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.200
ever since the Destruction of the Leaf incident,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.630
Danzo has been yearning...

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.570
for an opportunity to come in contact with you, Lord Orochimaru.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.930
His wounds are slow to heal...

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.500
Up to now,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.270
Naruto has always been a fast healer using the Nine-Tailed Chakra...

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.500
Naruto, being in the Nine-Tail's state ...

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.970
At first glance, it appears that he is being protected

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.230
by the Nine-tail's Cloak created by the Chakra...

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.470
But in actuality,

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.830
his body is continuing to suffer damage from the Nine-tail's Cloak

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.900
After the fourth tail formed,

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.630
his body, wrapped in the Nine-Tail's Cloak, grew bloodied...

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.900
and he thrashed about despite suffering serious injuries.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.800
The fourth tail that Jiraiya was talking about...

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.630
I wouldn't have imagined that it would be as powerful as this...

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:49.800
Captain Yamato...

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.430
That Jutsu that stopped Naruto earlier on...

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.500
Would you teach me that Jutsu...?

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.900
That's not possible...

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.130
The only person in the Leaf Village who can use that Jutsu is me,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.600
since I inherited the First Hokage's cells.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.330
What that Jutsu does is forcibly suppress the Nine-Tail's Chakra...

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.930
It's impossible for someone without that special power to use it.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.870
My power, which is just an experimental copy,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.400
is certainly not on the same level as the First Hokage's original.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.130
What Naruto has hanging around his neck is something

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.300
that belonged to the First Hokage...

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.600
It's a Chakra crystal that only resonates

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.700
to the First Hokage's Chakra.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.270
With that necklace, one can control a Jinchuriki's Chakra.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.000
It is said that this power is the very reason

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.530
that the First Hokage became the Hokage.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.230
And it's also the reason that

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.800
I was chosen to be the Captain of this team...

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.100
It's always like this...

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.300
All I can ever do for Naruto...

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.330
are the smallest things.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.200
It's not important whether the things you do are large or small.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.230
What's important...

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.270
is the magnitude of the feelings you have for Naruto.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.000
Sakura... I can tell that when I look at you.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.330
You truly... S-Sakura...

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.500
Owww!

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.170
Naruto...!

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.130
What happened to me...?

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.430
I was chasing that jerk Orochimaru... and then...

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.330
And then, what did I do after that?

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.730
Hey, Sakura...

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:46.800
Huh?

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.470
Why are you crying, Sakura?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I just got something in my eyes...

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.270
That acid-tongued Sai said something abusive to you again, right?

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.470
Like, "You're ugly!"

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.870
Or, "You're Herculean!"

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.300
That jerk!

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.630
Sai hasn't called me Herculean...!

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.170
R-Really?

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.330
Don't make up stuff... You jerk!

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.670
By the way... Captain Yamato...

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.870
Where's Sai?

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.800
That's everything that Danzo asked me to convey.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.270
That's extremely interesting...

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.900
And...about that story...

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Why should I believe it?

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.630
What's going on here?

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.130
Just calm down...Kabuto.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.130
That child is going to be one of our subordinates starting today.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.570
Can you trust...this guy...?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.800
Look inside that envelope.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.300
It's for you, from Danzo.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.500
This is...

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.430
What does it say?

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.370
Kabuto, let go of that child

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.430
We're taking that child along with us.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.530
Sai...was it?

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.500
Shall we go then...?

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.470
Just as I thought...

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.130
Captain Yamato?

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.600
Sai is...

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.600
Wait a moment...

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.200
The bridge...

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.970
I did plant one on him back at the hot springs, just in case...

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.170
Oh well. I'll continue the pursuit as is.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.500
I might not look it,

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.670
but pursuit is actually one of my strong points.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.730
Captain Yamato...

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.730
Oh yeah...

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:22.670
Right now, Sai is...

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.630
traveling together with Orochimaru.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.430
Together with...?

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.030
What does that mean?

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.170
Both of you follow me.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.100
The earth is still soft.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.630
The bridge is busted...

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.200
and this place is in such an awful state...

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.530
What the heck...happened?

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:17.630
Don't you remember?

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.470
So it's just as Master Jiraiya said, huh...?

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.570
His anger becomes the trigger...

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.000
And as the number of Fox Spirit tails he grew increased,

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.000
he maintained consciousness up until the third tail.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.400
But by the fourth tail, he had lost all rationality...

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.400
and was controlled by destructive impulses.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.430
Come to think of it... why was I unconscious?

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.230
You were unconscious because you got creamed by Orochimaru.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.070
Are you serious?! Damn!

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.670
Sai's things are scattered all over the place...

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.700
But why is this here...?

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.770
A picture book... This looks interesting...

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.470
Hey, can I take a look at it along the way?

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.300
No, you can't... It's not finished yet...

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.300
and I never hand it over to anyone as a matter of policy.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.800
Because this belonged to my elder brother.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.030
Sai valued this picture book...

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.670
But despite that, here it is in a place like this.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.400
If he had to leave something so valuable behind,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.330
it demonstrates that he was in a tense state in front of Orochimaru.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.730
You seem to know that as if you witnessed it yourself.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.530
Until earlier on...

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:27.730
I placed my Wood Clone here, and was in communication with it,

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.400
using the wireless radio implanted here.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.630
What happened to Sai?

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.830
After Sai's...conversation with Orochimaru,

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.470
he went away with Orochimaru and Kabuto.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.500
What does that mean?!

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.200
What did they talk about?

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.870
They were talking a distance away...

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.170
so I couldn't make out the conversation.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.270
I wonder what they were talking about?

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.500
He might have been kidnapped and taken away.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.130
No, it seems that he approached Orochimaru of his own volition...

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.100
and handed him something.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.500
It was just like he was trying to cozy up to Orochimaru...

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.100
W-Wait a minute!

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.730
Even a disgusting guy like him wouldn't betray us, would he?

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.600
No, there is a possibility...

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.900
A long time ago,

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.630
he competed with the late Sarutobi Sensei...

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.500
over the position of the Third Hokage.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.970
Unlike the Third Hokage,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.130
he's the leader of a hard-line military faction...

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.130
based on rigid logic... and is Sai's superior.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.170
He hates me because...

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.030
I'm the granddaughter of the First Hokage...

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.670
as well as a student of the Third Hokage who was moderate...

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.130
Captain Yamato, do you know a person named Danzo...?

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.600
Yes, I know him.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.770
Who is...that guy?

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.800
A man from the Hawk Faction who in the past opposed the Third Hokage.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.370
He's Sai's boss...

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.230
And an old gramps who doesn't think well of the Third Hokage's will.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.430
Danzo may be using Sai to make some kind of move.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.370
It's possible that...

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.670
Sai may have been given a mission...

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.930
by Danzo that is separate from ours...

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.800
There is a possibility that he was charged...

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.030
with some kind of top-secret mission...

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.370
So he's just using our mission...

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.570
in order to make contact with Orochimaru?!

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.600
That's the gist of it.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.630
This may sound like an over-the-top theory...

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.930
but it is not outside the realm of possibility...so listen carefully.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.770
Danzo...

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.270
may be trying to destroy the Hidden Leaf Village!

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.430
Lord Orochimaru... I already know that, Kabuto.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.370
It looks like we're being followed.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.370
I wonder whether we're simply being followed...

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.700
or whether that guy, Sai, is a conspirator.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.370
Are you suspecting him?

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.500
After all, I don't trust him yet.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.670
Well, whatever the case, we can't split up right now.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:58.870
In other words...

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.570
we may need a corpse, right, Kabuto?

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.070
Next time: "The Consequences of Betrayal"
