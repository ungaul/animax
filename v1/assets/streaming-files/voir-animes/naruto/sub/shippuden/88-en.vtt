WEBVTT

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.000
Sasuke Uchiha...

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.170
I can't forgive him 'cuz he killed Orochimaru,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.070
whom I planned to kill!

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.030
Ha!

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.670
Tobi, look how he's glaring at us!

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.030
Clash!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.330
Where's Itachi Uchiha?

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.670
Huh?

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.470
Tell me, and I'll let you go.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.200
Sharingan...eh?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.470
He really is Itachi's little brother.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.730
You were only able to kill Orochimaru thanks to your Uchiha blood.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.870
You're nothing but a fool blessed with good genes!

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.030
He's fast!

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.970
Huh?!

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.270
One down.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.300
So I'll ask you, the one with the big mouth, about Itachi.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.830
What're you doing, Tobi?!

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.300
Don't let your guard down just because he's a kid!

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.630
His Teleportation Jutsu is too quick. We're no match for him!

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.430
That guy...!

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.300
First, I'll watch his movements with chakra level C1.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.670
Tobi! Stay back!

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.230
S-Senpai! Time out!

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.630
Don't do it!

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.200
Senpai! Behind you, behind you!

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.170
Ha!

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.830
Senpai!

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.000
He was strict, but a good partner...

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.500
I shall never forget about you, Deidara Senpai--!

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.700
Will you shut up?!

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.330
Oh, you're alive?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.800
The ability to produce an explosive with his palm, huh?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.230
I somehow managed to escape by hiding in the bomb blast...

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.200
Good thing I kept the chakra level at C1.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.830
He definitely moves swiftly...

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.000
How about this then?

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.830
I'll play with you a bit more!

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.830
Child's play?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.300
So stupid.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.730
It's not over yet!

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.730
I guess...it's about time.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.800
No way!

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.800
Huh?

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.130
Yeah, I thought so.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.500
Hey...!

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.370
How's that?!

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.070
Oh... He's not much, after all...

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.070
I knew it!

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.300
Hey, Tobi!

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.630
Whose side are you on anyway?!

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.830
A Substitution Jutsu, eh?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.800
Well, he's definitely quite skilled...

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.430
Then this calls for C2.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.770
Th-That's...!

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:08.800
Ta-daa! One of Senpai's signature art pieces, the C2 Dragon!

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.330
Tobi, you know what to do, right?!

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.930
Of course, Senpai! We're going with "that," right?!

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.030
Yeah! "That" is the plan...

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.670
That huge thing becomes an explosive too?

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.770
I'm counting on you, Tobi!

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.130
Right!

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.770
And judging from its looks, it'll be attacking from the sky...!

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.700
This is bad.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.270
Here he comes! Let's show him, Senpai...

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.370
The power of your pop art!

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.530
Pop art is dead! My art is...

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.630
Superflat!

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.000
Ha!

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.330
It's different from before... A guided missile?

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.800
Where's the other one?

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.330
Guess I'll start off with him!

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.970
Looks like it can only reach up to five meters, eh?

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.370
Tsk... He figured out my limit.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.300
That's Kakashi's trick right?!

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.270
I'll give you credit for the skill in changing chakra form to extend and throw.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.400
But the force of this one's different from earlier.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.700
Blow to bits!

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.530
He really is swift.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.400
Got him!

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.170
Did I get him...?

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.970
That's...Orochimaru's Curse Mark!

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.400
He can even grow wings?

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.670
He managed to dodge it by flying upwards...

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.270
Senpai! All the land mine clay is set and ready to go!

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.300
Good job, Tobi! You stay back.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.000
Yessir!

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.170
Guided missile attacks from above, and land mines from the ground!

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.400
The key element of the C2 coordinated assault

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.730
is using the land mines to slow you down

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.870
and finishing you off with a pinpoint missile attack.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.030
Land mines are planted all around you!

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.600
Step on one and you'll set them off!

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.800
He plans to ram the guided missile right into me.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.200
And it's flying just outside my attack perimeter...

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.800
With that wounded leg,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.170
I wonder if you can dodge my aerial attack...hmm?

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.770
The next one's gonna be big!

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.300
As if I'll let you fly away!

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.370
Ha!

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.900
That's what you get for trying to guard yourself with wings.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.030
You can't fly anymore, can you? Not with one wing...

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.230
You're awesome, Deidara Senpai!

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.530
Well, let's settle this!

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.000
As if that'll hit me!

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:15.130
No foothold! Fall on a land mine and you'll lose a limb for sure!

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.930
A-A foothold?!

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:25.670
What?!

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.830
He reached me?

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.030
Deidara's balance...!

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.330
He purposely stuck his sword in the ground?

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.130
He tested for the presence of land mines and created a foothold?!

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.200
The length of the sword, which he used as a foothold...

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.530
And that jump using his single wing...

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.330
This position?!

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.130
I see. With that attack, he lured me directly above the sword...

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.570
The shortest distance that a chakra sword would reach...

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:01.800
Senpai!

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.770
I can't move...!

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.670
This is bad! Below me are the land mines...!

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.230
Senpai!!

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.330
You did die by bombing, after all!

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.370
Deidara Senpai...you fool!

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.170
I keep telling you to shut up, Tobi!

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.300
Huh? Y-You're still alive...?

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.900
What a stubborn...

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.630
You...stupid brat!

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:56.830
Those eyes...

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.530
It's those same eyes...

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.870
Damn it!

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.870
"Akatsuki"?

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.430
Like I care! Don't interfere with my appreciation of art.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.300
And I'm supposed to take this kid as my partner...?

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.730
He's feisty, but looks like the type to die young.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.530
It's our leader's orders... We can use his powers.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.800
You know about my power? Just who the hell are...?

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.470
You're the bomb terrorist who's been supporting

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.070
the anti-government factions in various lands.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.900
What purpose would that serve a rogue ninja like you...?

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.000
Purpose? I have no purpose!

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.100
I get requests to set off explosions, so I do.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.900
With my creations!

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.700
Creations?

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:05.730
That's right.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.370
Look!

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.070
Well? Such refined lines,

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.670
and a form that pursues two-dimensional deform.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.330
This  is art!

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.800
But that's not all there is to my art!

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.430
My creations flow!

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.130
When it has shape, it's simply molded clay!

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.770
But this explodes!

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.630
And the explosion causes sublimation,

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.470
and for the first time, the essence of my creation appears!

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.800
That instant of sublimation is when I experience true art!

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.070
Art is an explosion!

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.200
How annoying...

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.900
Is he done?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.600
Who knows...

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.530
Never mind... I'll do it.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.030
What's with his eyes...?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.030
You wanna fight?

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.130
If I win, you will become a member of Akatsuki.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.630
Don't belittle...me...or my art!

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.600
My ninjutsu is nothing but noble, refined art!

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.400
Feel my art!

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.000
Ha!

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.400
You talked big... but is that all you have?

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.000
It's over!

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.000
You should take a good look at yourself.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.070
Huh?

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.030
Wh-What?!

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.330
That was close.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.170
A little later and you would've blown yourself up.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:04.000
I told you he was the type to die young.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.000
A Genjutsu! When?!

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.400
From the very beginning.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.870
From the moment you looked into Itachi's Sharingan eye,

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.400
you were under his Genjutsu.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.270
Beautiful...

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.430
This is...art!

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:05.470
Damn! I became fascinated by the abilities of another?

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:13.430
That's art? No way... I refuse to acknowledge it!

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.030
You lose.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.770
Don't mess with me! I'm better than you!

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:29.570
My ability is flawless... It's art that is unbeatable!

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.600
I'm better than you! I can't lose...!

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.130
Lose to such a...

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.630
Lose to such a...!

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.170
Huh?! He's eating the Detonation Clay, which means...

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.700
I saved the best for last! I'll kill you with this!

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.870
Tobi, get away!

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.230
Whoa, yikes!

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.300
It's the C4 Karura!

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.930
Hurry!!

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.400
This was supposed to be my trump card to kill Itachi, but...

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.300
What?!

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:42.630
Wow, the enemy is pretty strong. He's not Itachi's little brother for nothing.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.730
But boy, Senpai sure is fired up. Flying, exploding and falling.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.030
At this rate, he'll really have to apologize to Itachi later.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.430
Wow? W-Wait a minute, Senpai!

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.670
Could that possibly be the...?

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.230
Ayeee...! No no no!

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.000
Please don't say "Ha!" just yet!

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:05.430
Next time: "Art"

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:09.630
Tune in again!
