WEBVTT

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.130
Stabilize

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.270
How's it going?

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.630
Are you able to control the Nine-Tails Chakra okay, Tenzo?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.970
There are no problems so far.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.930
I mean, please call me Yamato, not Tenzo.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.600
Okay, okay.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.400
Yes! It cut quite a bit!

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.600
Damn it! And mine still hasn't cut at all!

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.330
I'm much better than you guys!

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.830
You're me, I'm telling you.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.730
Yes!

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.130
Damn it... That me over there's pretty good...

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.400
I've got to do something...

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.130
Say! Say!

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.300
I've got something I want to ask you, Kakashi Sensei...

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.530
What is it?

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.370
Is there anyone in the Leaf who has the wind property?

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.770
You going to ask about the trick to it?

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.770
Yeah!

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.670
Well, you could say there's a person...

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.970
Right about now he's probably playing shogi...

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.330
Check.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.030
Oh! I lost again!

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.430
Our next end-of-mission party's on you, Sensei.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.900
Right...

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.800
Hey!

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.570
Asuma Sensei!

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.130
Oh, it's Naruto.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.770
Is there something you need?

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.130
As it happens, there's something I want to ask you...

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.030
Writhe

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.370
The trick to the wind Change in Chakra Nature, huh...?

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.230
Right!

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.200
Don't tell me you're doing Chakra Change in Chakra Nature training?

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.430
Yeah!

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.930
You've got to have a sense for that kind of thing...

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.570
Can you handle it?

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.530
That's why I came here to ask Asuma Sensei.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.900
You've got the same wind Chakra property as me, right, Sensei?

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.730
I never thought you'd have the wind Chakra property, Naruto...

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.530
This is indeed a shock.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.630
Asuma Sensei, please teach me the trick to it...right away.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.700
Let me see...

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.200
I could think about it if you'd pay the barbeque bill

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.300
for Team Asuma's next end-of-mission party...

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.230
Oh! That's dirty!

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.330
What do you think?

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.000
If that's it... Just enough, huh?

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.570
I'll lose everything I've got, though...

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.470
I have no choice. It's for my training!

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.700
All right! It's a deal.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.570
This is my Chakra Blade...

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.470
This blade is made from a special metal

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.330
that absorbs the owner's Chakra property.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.000
That's awesome...

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.300
Here, take it.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.900
Try pouring your Chakra into the blade.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.900
Right.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.230
My Chakra...kind of comes out different than yours, Asuma Sensei.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.600
Listen up.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.200
The wind Change in Chakra Nature splits Chakra in two

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.830
and grinds them together.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.330
Grinds them together?

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.600
And then you build up the two Chakra as if steadily honing them.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.370
As if steadily ...honing them...

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.730
That's right...

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.630
The trick is steady ...and sharp.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.070
Say... um... I was thinking... What is it?

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.730
Even though we've got Ninja Tools to start with...

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.030
is there a point to this wind Change in Chakra Nature?

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.830
Wouldn't it be quicker just to cut with something that cuts right from the start?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.870
And is there a point...

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.600
to pouring cutting Chakra into a weapon that already cuts?

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.100
Okay. I'll show you whether or not there's a point to that...

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.670
Listen up.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.170
We'll try throwing these Chakra Blades toward that tree at the same time.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.570
What for?

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.670
Don't worry about that. Let's go.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.130
One, two--!

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.430
Th-That's awesome!

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.600
It went all the way through...

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.300
not just the tree but into that really hard rock and got lodged inside...

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.300
It's dangerous, so I held back just now.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.970
It would've gone right through the rock if I'd gone all out.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.030
The quality of the blade will determine the result

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.470
in the case of Ninja of the same level getting into a serious battle.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.530
The wind Property has the most attack power

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.670
in close to medium-range battles.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.730
There really aren't that many...wind types.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.400
Oh, really...?

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.770
Come on by if there's ever anything else you want to ask me...

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.430
But you'll have to pay for the barbeque.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.670
Right!

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.400
Thanks!

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.270
Oh, it was a Shadow Clone?

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.300
That Naruto...

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.200
He forgot that we've got Choji on our team.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.130
That's harsh...

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.800
Can he really create something like a new Jutsu

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.630
before the Akatsuki start moving into high gear?

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.330
We'll see...

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.900
Wouldn't it be best to keep Naruto hidden somewhere

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.000
before making contact with the Akatsuki?

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.730
That's up to the Fifth Hokage to decide...

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.630
I get it! So that's how to do it!

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.770
All right!

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.300
- Let's do it! - Let's do it!

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.770
It appears he found out the trick to it from Asuma.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.530
He's already doing a good job

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.530
of applying the attributes of his Shadow Clones, that Naruto...

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.000
Naruto...

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.670
When a friend is putting extra effort into work or a hobby,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.600
you should casually bring them some refreshment.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.300
He's got more problems... than extra effort...

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.570
We've received a report from someone in a village bordering the Land of Fire

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.470
that they were attacked...

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.100
Was it the Akatsuki...?

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.800
The possibility is undeniable.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.730
But it seems there's suspicion it might be someone

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.970
from the Village Hidden in the Rain.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.430
Why...? Why would a neighboring village...?

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.770
And if the worst were to happen, conflict could develop between fellow lands.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.600
Perhaps they learned that the Akatsuki are after Naruto

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.470
and took advantage of the opportunity...

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.370
They wouldn't be that short-sighted...

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.570
But either way, we must analyze the situation.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.270
Summon Asuma...

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.400
Yes, ma'am...

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.470
But then, there will be even less Jonin in the village.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.130
If the Akatsuki were to come for Naruto now,

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.430
it will be a lot of trouble to protect him...

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.830
Yes...

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.370
All right! We'll go ahead and have you accumulate experience.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.730
Ruminate in your head on the training and break the Jutsu!

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.230
- Right! - Right!

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.700
All right! Let's go!

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.530
I can manage this... I'll be able to do it soon...

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.770
The drawback is that

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.800
mental fatigue is accumulated along with the experience...

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.900
I knew that from the start...

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.030
But...I'm almost there...

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.630
Let's take a short break, Naruto.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.200
This isn't the time to be taking it easy!

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.530
I'm okay, Kakashi Sensei...

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.430
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.970
What...? Oh! Hey... Just a minute!

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.070
Stabilize

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.830
Whoa...That's incredible...

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.170
You're really working hard, Naruto...

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.070
Well, I guess with his stamina, he'll be fine.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.900
Here you go... Thanks...

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.100
Who're they for...?

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.600
Oh, nobody in particular...

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.400
See you later...

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.900
Say "Hi" to Kurenai Sensei for me!

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.100
Wha--?! How did... you know that?!

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.570
Oh, there he is...

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.800
Sorry to bother you while you're on your way to Kurenai Sensei's place...

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.570
Huh? You guys, too? How...?

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.670
Huh? Everybody knows... Shikamaru!

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.630
Oh...right...

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.700
We received orders from the Fifth Hokage

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.300
for everyone from Team Asuma

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.630
including myself, Choji and Ino to assemble immediately.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:26.870
What?!

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.470
What...? All members from... the old Team Ten...?

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:31.370
Yeah...

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.900
Let's go!

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.100
The four of you,

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.100
Asuma Sarutobi, Shikamaru Nara, Ino Yamanaka and Choji Akimichi,

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.870
are assigned the mission to investigate

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.970
a town near the border that was attacked.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.300
- Yes, ma'am! - Yes, ma'am!

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.230
This comes at a time when Akatsuki developments are of great concern!

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.000
Tackle this mission with great care!

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.600
What're we going to do about Naruto?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.570
A D-rank mission like this should be perfect...

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.330
Grave robbery, huh...?

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.400
- Yes! - Yes!

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:29.030
I did it! Am I awesome or what?!

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.370
At this rate, I'll master a new Jutsu just like that!

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.770
No...You're making fast progress because of this training approach.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.400
It's thanks to my amazing idea...

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:43.470
It's also thanks quite a bit to me, Kakashi Senpai...

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.370
More importantly, I'm ready to get right to my next training.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.370
Well! You can do it because it's you.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.100
Naruto!

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.730
Yamato, let's take a short break while we're at it.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.200
Understood...

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.900
Will Naruto be okay...?

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.200
He should be fine if he rests a bit...

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.430
Man, this kid's really something else...

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:15.930
Umm...

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.970
Hm...? What is it, Sakura...?

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.330
Lady Tsunade wants to see you...

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.430
Asuma Sensei!

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.370
All right, it looks like everyone's here...

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.770
Hey, hey, Sensei.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.270
What is it?

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.530
Come on... Don't you know, Sensei...?

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.470
Oh...!

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.970
It's the first time we've all gathered before you wearing these earrings...

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.670
Choji, Ino, you guys did well...

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.030
And now along with Shikamaru who passed last time,

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.170
all members of Team Ten are legitimate Chunin.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:33.030
And now, I will no longer be in charge of you guys.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:39.430
From here on, each of you will become a captain and lead new teams.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.200
These earrings are my congratulatory gifts to each of you.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.230
Don't forget that you were members of Team Ten!

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.800
I see...

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.130
It's the first time Team Ten...

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.800
has appeared together in a while, huh...?

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.470
Why do I have to go so far as to suspend my training

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.030
to head out on a mission?!

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.600
It's a mission, so we have no choice...

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.770
But it depends on the mission, doesn't it...?

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.470
Why did that Grandma Tsunade give us

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.670
some petty little mission like a grave robbery...?

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.330
Yo, Naruto... What about your training?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.900
It was suspended for a mission...

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.470
Ino, are you guys heading out now, too?

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.770
That's right... All of us for the first time in a while...

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.600
You're all together...

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.130
Konohamaru!

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.970
You've got a mission, Brother Naruto?

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.170
You could say that... What? Looking for cats again?

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.600
That's right...

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.930
This is already the seventh time... I'm a veteran now.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.770
I see! You're hanging in there, huh?!

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.800
Well, I'm off to give my report...

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.600
See you later, Konohamaru.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.130
Good luck, Uncle Asuma!

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.730
Uncle Asuma, huh...? Uncle...?

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:58.330
Why?

00:16:58.570 --> 00:16:59.830
What do you mean why?

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.470
He's Konohamaru's uncle, that's why.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.770
What?! Then, then...

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.900
Asuma Sensei is the Third Hokage's son...

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.470
I didn't know that!

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.170
N-Neither did I...

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.070
No kidding...?

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.970
Wh-What is it...?

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.530
I never thought you were the Old Man Third Hokage's son...

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.970
I have the same Chakra property...

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.300
And it's like...I feel more of a sense of affinity than before...

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.530
Well, you'll be able to continue your training,

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.130
no matter what mission you take part in.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.070
Make sure you don't forget, okay?

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.270
Steady...and sharp!

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.000
Got it!

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.100
All right, Team Yamato! Let's head out on our mission!

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.970
Hey, wait up!

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.430
N-Naruto...

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.900
Are you the team captain?

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.870
Yes. I hear Kakashi Senpai has a different mission, so...

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.370
I leave Naruto...to you.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:56.600
Right.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.570
Hey, Captain Yamato! What's keeping you?!

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.800
Excuse me.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.170
Sorry! Sorry!

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.670
Now, I guess we'll get going, too!

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:11.900
- Right! - Right!

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.700
He is learning at a phenomenal speed...

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.500
But he's still got a long way to go before he develops a new Jutsu.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.130
I expected that.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.500
I'm sorry about this at such a time,

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.000
but I want you to meet up with Jiraiya

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.870
and look into developments with the Akatsuki.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.030
I'd like to be able to give Naruto time to focus on his training, but...

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.930
Naruto wants to get it done as quickly as possible,

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.230
so he's pushing it quite a bit.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.770
At this rate, even with Yamato around,

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.370
there could be another explosion of power

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.970
if he continues to train...

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.400
I don't think I'm making a mistake in this judgment.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.570
Look...at the people's suffering.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.230
Their tears! Their anger!

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.570
The Land of Fire has no need for neighbors...

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.570
Words are not necessary for those who cannot understand one another...

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.100
The Land of Fire must rise now

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.200
and be the tallest mountain that unifies the world.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:38.930
For this reason...

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.000
the decayed and rotten Leaf must be gotten rid of...

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.330
We shall...awaken the Land of Fire!

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.300
I'll get this mission over with right away and get back to training!

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.600
Come on...

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.830
Don't get careless thinking this is just a D-rank mission!

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.900
I know!

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.730
Why does Grandma Tsunade have us chasing after grave robbers?!

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.670
We have no choice. Don't be complaining about it now.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.630
But...

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.630
Well, speaking of grave robbers, they're just one kind of thief, so...

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.470
We can't say that for sure in this particular incident.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.870
It seems they're not after money as would normally be the case.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.800
What do you mean?

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.930
I still don't know for sure,

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.970
but it looks like there's some kind of ulterior motive.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.900
Next time: "Deprived of Eternal Rest"
