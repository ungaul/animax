WEBVTT

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.700
Fire Style: Searing Migraine!

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.830
He can even use the Fire Style?

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.830
Choji! Ino! You guys okay?

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.930
Yes!

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.330
Yeah...!

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.800
You're pretty good, just as I thought...

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.030
Kakashi Sensei!

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.400
Are you okay?

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.470
Yeah...

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.470
That being said,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.270
I've used four Lighting Blade shots while using the Sharingan...

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.130
I can't be sitting idly by.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.270
They're using really good combos.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.870
And here Kakashi Sensei definitely nailed him with the Lightning Blade...

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.370
Why won't he die?

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.470
I'm sure I crushed his heart. He really should be dead.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.970
But what I killed was one of the monsters

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.870
that came out of his body.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.270
We can assume that it died in place of his real body.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.530
It was the same when he broke my Shadow Possession Shuriken Jutsu...

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.300
Something that looked like a heart was attached

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.430
to the arm that had been separated from his body

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.800
and it was moving on its own.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.870
What...does that mean?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.270
If you include his real body,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.500
each monster that came out of his body has a heart, and they are all his.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.130
In other words, it means he probably has five hearts.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.900
What?!

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.200
How can he...?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.070
However, he lost one of them to Sensei's Lightning Blade just now, though.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.100
Then that means we have to crush his other four hearts

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.000
in order to take him out completely?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.130
Yeah...

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.830
You're very perceptive. That's exactly right...

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.530
I took each of these hearts from Shinobi I once fought.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.370
I can always replenish my stock...

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.100
with your hearts.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.500
I get it...

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.430
By connecting his Chakra Network to the others' hearts,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.700
he incorporates their Chakra natures as well, huh?

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.630
No wonder he's able to use several different natures.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.930
By the way, does the Hidden Leaf Village bury their dead?

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.630
Burials are a pain in the neck, you see.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.500
I bet Kakuzu's going to say,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.570
"We're going to dig up the body and exchange him for money."

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.900
And here I thought I could have some fun with that bearded jerk...

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.770
He was nothing special, after all.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.070
You're one to talk, especially since you got your head chopped off...

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.130
Shut up. You keep quiet!

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.670
I'm sure you guys are intent on revenge.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.670
But you guys are too weak for that.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.300
You all look like kids. I guess you were his students, huh?

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.870
Well, with scum like him as your teacher, you won't amount to much.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.900
Don't insult Asuma Sensei!

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.070
Choji.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.870
Beautiful loving bonds between student and teacher, huh?

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.830
Heh, how stupid!

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.300
You jerk...!

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.130
Choji!

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.830
What's so great about an idiot like that?

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.000
Fatty?!

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.700
Choji!

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.930
You idiot!

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.470
What's the point of getting stirred up by such an obvious trick?!

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.970
I-I'm sorry...

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.830
Choji!

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.630
At this rate...

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.670
Die.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.700
Little girl...

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.100
Shikamaru!

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.870
You small fries.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.270
Die.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.830
It's over for you, too.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.370
WATER

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.370
Oh, boy.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.270
How pathetic...

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.870
You okay?

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:39.830
Y-Yeah...

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.230
Somehow.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.800
You're pathetic, man. What a disgrace.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.570
You, too. How could you not realize it was a Shadow Clone?

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.830
Uh-oh... You saw that?

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.700
Shikamaru... How shall we fight?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.330
Let's separate those two.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.300
Our best plan would be to attack them separately.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.200
Yeah.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.030
After we eliminate their ability to do combo attacks,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.970
we'll focus on destroying his four remaining hearts.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.770
If we're going to do that, we'll need someone to stall Hidan...

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.930
I'll do it!

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.270
I have the most Chakra stored up right now.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.730
And I won't be of much use in straight attacks...

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.400
I'll use my Mind Transfer Jutsu...

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.230
No! The Mind Transfer is primarily a Combo Jutsu

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.900
used after stopping an opponent's movements with my Shadow Possession.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.570
If you miss,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.670
you won't be able to return to your own body for several minutes.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.930
It's too risky!

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:48.930
I'll do it.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.930
- Huh? - What?!

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.300
We'll separate them after I restrain him with my Shadow Possession Jutsu.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.000
But how do you plan on restraining him?

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.570
We'll need a diversion, either way.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.330
Then I'll take care of that.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.570
That won't do, either!

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.070
You'll be finished if he attacks you and gets even a little of your blood.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.630
It'll be just like before.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.030
It'd be a bad move for us to approach him and attack!

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.300
Choji.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:22.570
You store up Chakra to take out the masked guy with Kakashi Sensei.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.900
Right!

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.730
I'll capture him by myself.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.600
And...

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.900
I'll fulfill that role!

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.070
I'll capture him by myself.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.930
And...

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.630
I'll fulfill that role!

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.930
Got it. I'll leave it to you, Shikamaru.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:07.270
Take this.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.470
Right...

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.270
That again?!

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.530
Are you that afraid of my powerful scythe?

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.400
I'm your opponent.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.230
Hey-hey-hey!

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.730
Sneaking around like that from a distance?

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.970
How pathetic!

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.830
Too slow!

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.000
What--?!

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.670
He picked it up... and threw it with his shadow?!

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.400
He can't move in midair!

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.370
He's ours!

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.030
You wish!

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.530
If I just focus on the shadow, a Jutsu like this is worthless!

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.170
What?

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.300
I'm not just sneaking around from a distance!

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.700
The Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.470
You...jerk!

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.230
Go, Shikamaru!

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.200
Leave this to us!

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.300
We're counting on you!

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:12.730
Right...

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.130
Let's take a nice little walk... just the two of us.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.570
Hey, where are we going?

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.070
Are you trying to separate me from Kakuzu?!

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.600
You...jerk!

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.700
Shouldn't someone go with him?

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.300
You're really underestimating Hidan.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.870
And here that kid called Shikamaru or whatever...

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:21.570
would've become a bounty of high value someday.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.330
Now...

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.200
he's dead.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.400
But your decision was the right one.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.230
I'm...powerful.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.800
There's a great difference in battle experience between you guys and myself.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.970
Seeing those headbands reminds me

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.230
of the first Hidden Leaf Shinobi I ever fought...

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.500
The First Hokage.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.270
What?

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.730
How old is this guy?!

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.770
Are you really immortal?

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.270
No. Something like that doesn't exist in this world...

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.470
It's just that I can keep on living...

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.870
I maintain a stock by taking the hearts of those I kill

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.900
before my own runs out of life...

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.870
So you won't let me get away, huh?

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.170
This shadow technique... only lasts about five minutes, right?

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.130
And it's just the two of us...

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.630
That works out well for me, too. You idiot!

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.900
The Fire Style and Wind Style masks?

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:20.670
I can stock five hearts including my own...

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.070
Kakashi...

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:29.070
I will take your heart... to replace the one you took from me!

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.170
Everything's ready...

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.570
I've waited for this...

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.700
Die!

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.330
It appears you had no doubt your partner would win.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.700
But you guys really underestimated Shikamaru.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.600
This is a battle he himself was determined to fight.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.800
No way would he let the information Asuma left behind,

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.770
at the cost of his own life, go to waste...

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:54.930
Everything's a Shogi match.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.030
The whole time, you guys were just being manipulated

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.100
according to our Shogi diagram!

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.300
