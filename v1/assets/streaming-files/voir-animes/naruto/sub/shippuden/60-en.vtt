WEBVTT

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.870
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.730
Damn it!

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.270
Hey, don't be so impatient.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.970
Your training is going well. Now it's only a matter of time.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.100
If it's just a matter of time,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.170
then you should let me train nonstop.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.870
I know you're tough, but...

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.400
I-I'm ready to go...anytime.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.300
I'm okay!

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.330
C-Captain Yamato... You're scaring me.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.270
Under the Starry Sky

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.700
You carry him for a while.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.800
Hey, hey, hey.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.030
You're the one always talking about money.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.430
You carry him all the way.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.730
He's your precious bounty, right?

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.300
What's with that look?

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.300
I'm definitely going to kill you someday.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.030
I told you, don't give me that...Kakuzu.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.170
Oh, he's doing fine. I guess he didn't need my food pills.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.600
I think he does.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.830
Hey! How long have you been there?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.500
Quite a while before you came.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.730
No way! I had no idea...

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.230
I didn't even sense your presence.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.300
I'm sorry.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.800
More importantly, that training is a lot tougher than it looks.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.800
Naruto isn't all that skillful from my viewpoint.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.630
He must sustain complete focus

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.900
while using Shadow Clones nearly to his limit.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.770
The degree of fatigue must be extraordinary

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.070
compared to that of normal training.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.730
Yes... That's right...

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.270
That's...

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.500
BASICS OF CHANGE IN CHAKRA NATURE what it said in this book...

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.830
You didn't have to hide anything.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.430
I thought you'd be appalled to learn...

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.230
I'm still relying on the knowledge of books.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.770
I knew it...

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.630
I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.570
It's perfectly fine.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.300
After all, you read up on it

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.670
because you're worried about your friends, right?

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.370
Books come in handy at times like that.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.200
You actually do have a nice side to you.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.670
What? I'm nice...?

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.600
Okay, let's go so we won't interfere with his training.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.830
I guess they shaped up into a good team while I was away.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.530
Well, that's good.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.430
Naruto!

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.900
Break the Shadow Clone Jutsu for a bit

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.270
and mull over the results of your current training.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.630
Accumulate your experience.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.730
Right!

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.830
So? Can you feel it?

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.200
I've still got a ways to go.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.930
I'm going to continue the training...

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.030
You're overdoing it, I tell you.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.570
What's that?

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.670
Sakura brought it for you.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.700
These are food pills... and there's a note inside.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.370
Eat one of my special food pills and keep up the training. - Sakura

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.570
Sakura...

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.300
Sakura's home-made food pills.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.870
Let's eat!

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.500
Sakura, these are totally inedible.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.430
Okay, time to continue training! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.300
I bet Naruto has been able to continue training

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.230
because of my food pills.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.370
W-Wow!

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.930
Naruto! Why don't you take a little break?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.900
I can't catch up to Sasuke if I throw in the towel now!

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.500
MEDICINAL HERBS Well, if it isn't Sakura.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.000
Oh, Iruka Sensei.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.070
Wow, Naruto sure is something else.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.130
He did a great job during the village's dilemma.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.230
I did, too!

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.870
Just kidding.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.070
Sorry, sorry.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.930
You've become Lady Tsunade's apprentice, after all.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.870
I'm so proud to have had such excellent students.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.700
My drop-out students are particularly lovable.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.600
Even now, Naruto's continuing with training that only he can do, right?

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.300
That's really something.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.470
I was excellent right from the start.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.870
Sorry I wasn't a lovable student.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.270
Oh, come on. You sure are giving me grief today.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.530
But he sure got stronger.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.170
Yeah. He's changed. Everyone's changing.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.330
My students are growing up strong and steadfast.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.930
What's that?

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.130
I see...

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.130
They even got Chiriku, huh...?

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.100
I was out on patrol...

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.830
and by the time I returned, it was too late.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.800
It was most likely the guys from the Akatsuki.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.000
They're probably going one by one to locations in the Land of Fire

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.970
where there might be a Jinchuriki.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.600
Finally they've come.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.030
We won't let them out of the Land of Fire.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.800
Contact the twenty newly formed platoons immediately!

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.700
That's all I have to say.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.200
Does anyone have any questions?

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:35.870
What is it?

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.370
Chiriku, a former member of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.930
should be there.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.600
What happened to him?

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.670
Lord Chiriku died by their hands.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.430
Chiriku was killed? It can't be...

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.670
For the pride of the Hidden Leaf, and most of all,

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.930
for the safety of the Land of Fire,

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:29.600
we must not let them rampage any further.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.430
I want to know what they're after, but they're very dangerous.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.530
Don't let them out of the Land of Fire, no matter what.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.930
Find them without fail and if you're unable to restrain them,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.070
kill them!

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.730
Go!

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:48.770
Dismissed!

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.830
I will do my best, and I won't bring shame to the former Team Asuma.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.500
We'll do our best, Shikamaru, Asuma Sensei!

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.270
Now then... Okay, we'll start with the Temple of Fire.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.800
Someone has to do it.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.130
Let's go.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.600
Asuma Sensei...

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:04.970
What is it?

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.700
It seems you were acquainted with Chiriku from the Temple of Fire.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.370
Yeah... Didn't I tell you?

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.170
We used to be brothers-in-arms.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.070
It was around the time when I left the Hidden Leaf

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.600
and was known as one of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.970
The Temple of Fire is close. Let's hurry!

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.670
The moon sure is beautiful.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.930
You're awesome, Sakura!

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.070
Just what I'd expect from the girl I knew you'd be!

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.530
Everyone's changing.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.370
That's right. Everyone's changed.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.670
Naruto is continuing with his training that nobody else can do...

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.270
all to pursue Sasuke.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.370
Oh, Naruto...

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.230
I can only do little things for him.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.670
It's not the size of the things you can do that matters.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.670
What's important is the strength of your feelings for Naruto.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.900
A shooting star, huh?

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.170
Sasuke...

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.030
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.570
Damn it!

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.070
Sasuke...

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.500
As long as I don't give in

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.170
and keep going without stopping to rest...

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.670
I'll arrive at the point where...

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.300
Here we go!

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:54.770
All right!

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.370
This training is something else, isn't it?

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.870
Naruto is progressing so quickly.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.630
No... It's not just because of this training approach.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.330
Sasuke has something to do with it, too.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.230
- We cut the waterfall! - We really cut it!

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.430
Well done.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.300
Now we can start development of your new original Jutsu.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.330
Right... I got it...

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.930
You okay, Naruto?!

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.570
I guess he overdid it a little.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.430
Wh-What is it?

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.670
I'm...hungry...

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.630
You really are...something else.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.030
Shizune, have we figured out what they're up to?

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.070
Using the twenty platoons,

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.970
we are currently laying out a search net

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.500
with a radius of 150 kilometers around the border and the Temple of Fire.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:53.270
And...it seems they have not yet encountered the Akatsuki.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.300
Why not?

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.900
We laid down a search net not even an ant could crawl through!

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:58.830
-Why haven't they been found yet?! -Well...

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.030
What about the report from Team Asuma

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.230
that was heading for the Temple of Fire?

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.770
Next time: "The Old Monk's Prayer"
