WEBVTT

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.070
In order to protect the Yamanaka and Nara Clan,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.730
and the Hidden Leaf Village, I, Choji Akimichi,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.070
swear to transform from a caterpillar into a butterfly…

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.780
and take flight!

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.900
I have nothing more to say to you three…

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.440
Because your Ino-Shika-Cho is complete.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.480
– Thank you… – Thank you…

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.320
I'm putting an end to the battle now!

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.570
So help me out, Shikamaru! Ino!

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.820
Choji, I've been with you for a long time…

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.320
But I've never seen you take charge like this!

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.190
A Message from the Heart

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440
You haven't been getting it for a while.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.070
Half-hearted attention, not enough preparation.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.360
Something's been bothering me for a while now.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.440
What is it?

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.530
Earlier… I thought I sensed the Nine Tails' chakra.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.820
But there's no way someone besides me

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.820
has the Nine Tails' chakra, right?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.480
You probably just imagined it.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.320
Chakra here is cut off, both inside and out.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.320
Nine Tails is only inside you. It's a bad joke, no doubt.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.650
Naruto's beginning to sense things.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.610
The only ones with Nine Tails' chakra besides Naruto,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.570
are the Gold and Silver Brothers.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.480
Which means, they've been resurrected with Orochimaru's jutsu.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.530
However, he has the power

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.860
to perceive the chakra more intensely in this room.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.280
We won't be able to fool him much longer.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.730
What'll we do, Bee?

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.690
Do what?

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.280
What do you mean, "do what"?

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.820
Weren't you paying attention to the plan?

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.730
We're not supposed to let Naruto out of this space!

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.190
That's what you're here for, Eight!

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.530
What a…! Damn it.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.820
Where's the bathroom?

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.860
Go outside. It's the door to your left.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.730
You idiot! Naruto's gonna escape!

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.820
Follow him!

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.030
Oh!

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.480
Don't panic. Contact HQ.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.480
What?

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.110
Nine Tails is attempting to go out?

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.360
What is Bee doing?!

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.900
Actually, Master Bee wasn't paying much attention

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.480
to the instructions…

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.650
However, we've taken measures.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.780
Lady Tsunade, please issue the order.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.570
Mmhmm.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.610
Stop…Naruto.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.820
Why are there are so many guards?!

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.440
Something's not right.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.400
Naruto, I'm sorry, but I cannot let you pass.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.570
Please go back to that room.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.320
Okay, but why is Shino's pop here?

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.610
Why are you watching me?!

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.360
Enough! Just go back inside, I'll tell you there.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.940
Why can't you tell me outside?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.610
Shibi, I'll talk to him.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.530
I-Iruka Sensei!

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.360
What're you doing on this island?!

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.730
We now have a secondary mission on this island.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.480
And we're here to back you up.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.280
We heard this place is dangerous.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.690
So why can't I go outside?

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.820
There's an unidentified creature

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.860
that we're trying to confirm.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.030
That's because… I sensed the Nine Tails' chakra.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.110
Is that related somehow?

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.110
He was able to perceive Kinkaku and Ginkaku's chakra even in here?

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.070
A place where all chakra is blocked out?

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.110
Letting him out would be dangerous.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.280
We must stop him.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.610
Do your best to convince him, Iruka.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.440
O-Oh, yeah.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.980
The creature seems to possess the Nine Tails' chakra.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.320
I guess there were others like the Nine Tails here.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.570
We can't afford to let you out

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.480
and rile up the Nine Tails inside you.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.980
That's why we want you to stay inside and lay low.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.980
Is that why Captain Yamato hasn't come back?

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.440
Yes. The Wood Style works best to suppress the Nine Tails' chakra.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.440
You know that.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.320
Come on, let's go back inside.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.860
Master Bee stands at the top of this island's hierarchy of beasts.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.230
That feeling I had when I exchanged punches

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.110
with old man Bee… That was for real.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.690
If those animals are running amuck, I'll suppress them.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.980
Let me check them out!

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.610
Do not let Naruto escape!

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.440
Right!

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.780
All right! I have him restrained with Shadow Possession!

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.150
W-What's going on?

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.650
He sensed it all with Sage Mode.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.610
Why is this happening?!

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.070
It's war…

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.690
Madara is waging war on us.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.820
Hey, Iruka! You…

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.650
Shibi, let's stop lying.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.480
Naruto isn't stupid.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.690
We should tell him the truth

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.650
and try to make him see where we're coming from.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.030
My comrades are fighting, and going through hell…

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.570
Why are you keeping all this from me?

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.400
This is a war to protect you.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.070
Madara launched a full-scale assault.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.360
In order to capture Nine Tails and Eight Tails

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.570
inside you and Lord Killer Bee.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.730
If he succeeds in getting both Tailed Beasts,

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.530
his jutsu will be complete, and this world will end!

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.070
Protecting you means protecting the future,

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.940
and protecting everyone.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.820
Everyone is putting their lives on the line.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.730
They are fighting to protect you.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.860
Naruto, your battle is with yourself.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.480
This is where you must endure it.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.690
There's no such thing as true peace!

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.820
As long as we live in this cursed world,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.900
peace is impossible!

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.400
Then…I'll break that curse.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.980
If there is such a thing as peace, I'll seize it!

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.900
I'll never give up!

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.110
No matter how great the pain, I'll continue walking.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.190
Because that's who Naruto is!

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:48.030
War inflicts death, injury, and pain to both sides.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.400
You may try to find meaning in death,

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.400
but there is only pain.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.400
An unbearable hatred…

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.820
Senseless deaths…

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.690
Eternal hatred… and pain that does not heal.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.360
That's what war is.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.480
Naruto… This is what you will be facing in time.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.940
My work ends here, Naruto.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.730
I believe you can bring true peace.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:32.530
Nagato… What you said to me… Is this what you meant?

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.400
Now, let's go back in.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.610
I'll stop this war by myself.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:50.280
I'll take on all the hatred and the pain.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.900
This is my duty!

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.480
Haven't you been listening?!

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.980
You have the Nine Tails inside you!

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.360
This isn't only about you, Naruto!

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.860
You were the very first teacher who recognized me,

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.530
yet you're only concerned about the Nine Tails!

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.360
Why can't you have faith in me?!

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.690
Don't act like a spoiled brat?!

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.530
To me, you are…

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.530
Taking on a parental tone like that won't work.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.530
There's no way that monster fox won't take advantage of his power.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.610
You just don't know how he…

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.110
That's true… if he's the monster fox.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.650
But Naruto is different.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.480
He's… He's someone I've recognized.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.440
He's an excellent pupil.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.860
He always gives a hundred percent and yet,

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.690
because he's clumsy, people don't acknowledge him.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.400
He already understands what human suffering is.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.980
He's not a monster fox anymore.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.280
He's the Village of the Hidden Leaf's…

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.480
Naruto Uzumaki!

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.570
To me, you are…

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.900
An important student.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.780
And…

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.440
I think of you as my little brother.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.690
The enemy leader is targeting you with everything he's got.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.570
How can we allow you to face such danger?

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.650
And besides, there is no reason for you to shoulder that burden alone.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.070
I'm different from before.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.530
I've become stronger!

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.940
And Sensei, you're the one who gave me that headband.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.610
Hey…Iruka…

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.230
No!

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.980
I still can't let you go!

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.820
Sensei, didn't I tell you I'm stronger now?

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.570
A barrier like this is…

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:12.610
He broke through!

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:13.610
I won't let him!

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.480
The Nine Tails' chakra is too strong.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.530
The Parasitic Insects are useless!

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.360
Temui!

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.360
Notify the Barrier Corps up ahead, that Naruto is heading their way.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.360
Right!

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.690
The rest of us will pursue Naruto!

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:35.610
Let's go!

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.820
Why, Iruka Sensei?

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.980
What's this?

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.730
Knowing you, you will rush to the battlefield.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.690
That's how determined you are.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.320
If you are reading this letter…

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.820
it means I wasn't able to stop you.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.190
Ever since Lady Tsunade ordered me

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.730
to detain you on the Cloud's secret hidden island,

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:27.400
I've had this letter ready, just for this purpose.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.360
I'm disappointed in myself for failing my mission.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.480
I don't know if I'll even be able to get you this note,

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.610
but there's something you need to hear from me.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.400
You've gone off, so this is the only thing left to say.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:50.190
Come back alive, no matter what.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.780
I'm sorry, Naruto. I'm weak.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.070
I act like your older brother,

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.400
but I've never been able to protect you…

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.610
So he's gone…fool, that fool.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.030
Killer…Bee, right?

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.780
I need to ask you a favor.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.400
I'm not sure, but I've seen you someplace

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.030
Every time, I can't remember the face.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.400
Please protect Naruto!

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.400
That's not the way to appeal, you see.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.070
You have to raise your fist at me.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.860
L-Like this?

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.900
Gotcha! Fool, ya fool!

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.940
It's you…

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.480
Should you be making a promise like that?!

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.980
You're Naruto's guard!

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.610
If he couldn't stop Naruto, no one can.

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.190
That's because…

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.690
You're always in Naruto's heart.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.940
You are his state of mind.

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.650
Me? In Naruto…?

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.030
I don't know what you did to Naruto…

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.610
But to him, you are something special

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.980
Even tho' my rap is scornful.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.360
Naruto listens to all you say.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.610
Naruto's kept it securely inside him, to this day.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.860
What has protected Naruto all this time…were your words to him.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.110
You really intend to leave this place to go after Naruto?

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.400
We're still in training, you fool, ya fool!

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.190
You're gonna get Raikage's Iron Claw afterwards,

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.360
that's for sure!

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.400
You learn faster in actual battle, you fool!

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.570
We're taking the shortcut, ya fool!

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.400
What is the meaning of this, Tsunade?!

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.900
The Nine Tails couldn't be stopped!

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.980
That Iruka…

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.480
We'll just have to use force.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.440
What's the status of the Barrier Corps?

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.400
They've put up a 36-layer Self-Regenerating Barrier

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.570
around the perimeter.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.230
Even a Jinchuriki will not be able to pierce through it.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.780
Please rest assured.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.320
It's Naruto! He's approaching!

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.440
It's time for us to show what we, the Barrier Corps, can do!

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.070
This is the reason why we went through all that hardship,

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.110
to put up this multi-layered barrier!

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.980
Do not let him pass!

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.320
The only message HQ will receive from us is…

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.190
"Mission accomplished!"

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.230
Do you understand?!

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.320
Wha—?!

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:07.360
What's this?!

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.480
There's a barrier beyond that.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.530
You and me are gonna break it, stat!

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:13.610
Octopops!

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.570
I'll break the barrier, fool!

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.900
Naruto, you get the Tailed Beast Bomb in, ya fool!

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.280
Right!

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.530
Not Bee the Eight Tails too?!

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.440
What?!

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.440
Here we go, ya fool!

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.070
It's no use!

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.530
The barrier isn't regenerating fast enough!

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.530
At this rate…

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.900
Chief… What do I tell HQ…?!

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.280
We couldn't stop him!

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.070
Yeah, I figured.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:45.570
– D-Damn it! – It's no use…

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.400
But there were two of them breaking it.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.030
No one mentioned there were two of them!

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.150
Incredible chakra!

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.530
An immense chakra field has appeared on the battlefield

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.480
near Darui's First Company!

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.730
What is it?

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.610
It appears to be some sort of humanoid monster!

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.320
It's ravaging our troops!

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.480
And it seems to be controlled by…

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.110
Who is it?!

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.190
We believe it's Madara Uchiha!

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.440
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Attack of the Gedo Statue"

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.230
Go! Gedo statue! ATTACK OF THE GEDO STATUE

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:07.860
ATTACK OF THE GEDO STATUE Tune in again!
