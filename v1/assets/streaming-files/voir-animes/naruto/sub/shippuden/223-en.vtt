WEBVTT

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.550
Dead men shouldn't go around messing things up!

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.400
Uchiha Reflection.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.470
I'll get the Eight and Nine Tails.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.260
Obito, you take down those two.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.520
- What?! - You're not getting away!

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.070
Obito... What happened to you?

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.150
Why would you join up with him?

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.620
Summoning Jutsu!

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.360
You're late, Obito!

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.240
You're finally here...

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.950
You must be Obito.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.040
We've been waiting for you.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.040
Barely made it... You're really late.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.630
We've already introduced ourselves.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.170
You're the only one left!

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.960
I'm going to be the Hokage!

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.760
My name's Obito Uchiha!

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.390
For my Great Stone Face,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.140
make sure my trademark goggles and Sharingan are nicely carved out!

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.270
So I can glare over the neighboring lands!

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.440
I'll scare the hell out of them with my Sharingan stare...

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.690
and no one will dare attack our village!

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.490
Rattle off your instructions after you become the Hokage

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.030
and activate your Sharingan.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.910
Besides, how can they carve the Sharingan

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.200
if you're wearing goggles?

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.040
They can carve it out over my goggles!

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.120
Then it will look like your eyeballs are popping out.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.550
Anyway...I'm happy that someone on this team

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.590
shares my dream.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.300
I'm Minato. From today, I'll be your superior.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.050
I'm glad to meet you!
Yeah!

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.600
Minato Sensei...

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.520
All of this...

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.810
This world...

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.570
- None of it matters anymore! - None of it matters anymore!

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.470
I'm not gonna let that happen, idiot!

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.980
I'm the son of the Fourth Hokage, you know!

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.980
I'm not gonna fall for your talk!

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.570
I see.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.110
I was going easy on you

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.400
because you were the actual Jinchuriki, not a clone.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.990
but if that's how you feel, I won't hold back on you!

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.410
This is Hashirama's wooden dragon,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.490
which he used to hold down my Nine Tails long ago.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.580
Madara really is crazy powerful.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.260
That's what makes him worth fighting.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.890
Your tough guy act is crazy solid.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.890
I'm not going to hold back against a zombie either!

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.970
Since you're already dead!

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.910
Why?!

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.580
Why ally yourself with someone like Madara?

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.510
I've got nothing to say to you.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.680
All that's left...

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.050
is this final battle!

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.570
Kakashi's Resolve

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.490
Earth Style... Mud Wall!

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.880
Why?

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.590
How about shutting up already?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.010
You're only talk. You're nothing but a piece of trash.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.090
I believe that the White Fang was a true hero.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.920
Sure, in the world of Ninja,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.340
one who breaks the rules and regulations

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.890
is regarded as trash.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.020
But those who abandon their comrades...

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.020
are worse than trash!

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.640
This is probably...

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.150
because you let Rin die.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.370
I am trash for sure...

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.540
But Obito, you've always...

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:21.960
Kamui...

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.050
...been my hero.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.300
So why?

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.310
Damn it!

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.660
That damned wooden thing!

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.490
It's absorbing the Nine Tails' chakra!

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.170
Damn it...

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.470
We have the same eyes...

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.470
So you made it out, huh?

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.510
Obito, how did you end up like this?

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.560
Does it have to do with Rin?

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.830
I'll protect my comrades!

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.870
Let's go rescue Rin right now!

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.420
Yeah!

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.690
I said, trash should keep their mouths shut!

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.240
Die.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.990
I...couldn't keep my promise to you.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.120
You're right. I'm trash.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.460
But you...

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.330
You're a hero of the Leaf.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.380
There's no reason for you to become trash too.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.520
This is reality.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.400
Those who bequeath and the bequeathed...both.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.190
All shinobi who survive in this world become trash.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.530
You and I are prime examples,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.030
Kakashi.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.120
Kakashi Sensei...

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160
I can't move...

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.970
These guys are a distraction for you too, right?

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.590
This world is about to come to an end.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.930
So in order to enjoy the little time we've got left...

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.180
Let's clear out this battlefield first.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.440
No one can escape the cycle that gives birth to trash in this world.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.660
That's why I intend to remake the world!

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.830
You guys make me so mad, I can't even think straight.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.540
So instead, let me tell you something about myself.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.600
I'm not trash!

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.150
I'm not planning on becoming trash either!

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:09.560
I will...

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.610
stop you!

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.370
- I'll never let my comrades die! - I'll never let my comrades die!

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.590
I'll never let my comrades die!

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.680
I'm sorry, Naruto.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.390
I'm the one who taught you Obito's words, and yet...

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.970
I was about to waver again.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.410
Hirudora!

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.370
Lightning Blade!

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.710
Guess it wasn't just a bluff.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.550
Obito...

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.680
Your once strong will is still alive today...

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.310
Right next to me!

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.940
What the current me can do is protect the current Naruto!

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.870
You'll protect the current Naruto?

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.880
Same here...

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.210
They're both at their limits!

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.380
These Hidden Leaf guys sure love to act tough!

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.020
The wood's constriction is weakening.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.150
Octopops!

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:25.780
Ow oww!

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.650
Be careful, Naruto!

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.240
The enemy's Wood Paralysis is identical to the First Hokage's!

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.660
It has the power to bind Tailed Beast Power!

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.580
Like Captain Yamato's technique...

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.670
A Lightning Blade that relies on the Sharingan...

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.010
You've mastered your left eye...

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.050
Even awakening the Mangekyo.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.430
But can you make it back from the other plane

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.810
in your current condition?

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.620
Go back to the trash heap, Kakashi!

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.240
Kakashi Sensei...

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.790
is just like...me!

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.340
Looks like we're gonna have to start worrying about Ten Tails.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.760
Let them handle Obito.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.690
Then we'll make our move!

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.480
Now I see it clearly...

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.750
your pained face.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.750
Save those lines for the one right next to you.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.180
I definitely have to help Kakashi Sensei somehow.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.890
He's completely drained from overusing the Sharingan.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.180
If he gets sucked in...

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.770
Naruto, switch with me...

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:23.810
Huh?

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.770
Let me handle this.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:26.860
But...

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.400
Don't argue. Just switch!

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.160
Hey, Kakashi brat, give me your hands...

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.660
You're...

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.290
Never mind that! Just stick out your hands!

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.310
Kurama! What the heck did you just do?

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.570
Now you don't have any distractions.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.030
I'm leaving the rest to you, Naruto.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:13.610
What?!

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.820
Damn!

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.890
Now that we know how your ability works, I can counter it.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.600
Here's another!

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.860
Oh yeah, that certainly is a pained face Obito.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.230
What's going on?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.610
Kakashi did that. Over there.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.740
The difference between you and me is...

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.580
I can give or take chakra voluntarily at will.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.960
I'll show you how it's done later.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.460
When did you pass it to him?

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.800
When I grabbed his hand to throw him.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.220
So then...!

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.380
Yeah, whenever he wants to,

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.680
he can use Kamui to come out.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.890
Kakashi Sensei!

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.640
Thank Nine Tails for me.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.150
Sure!

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.090
Let's blast him to bits before he revives!

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.260
Put in everything you've got!

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.050
Right!

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.440
It's ready to go, Octopops and Eight-o!

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.400
Okay!

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.480
Fire!

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.070
It's over now!

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.880
The Statue's chakra...is gone.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.680
We did it.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.760
We did it, fool! Ya fool!

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.770
All right then!

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:31.890
It's over?

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.400
Yeah...for this world.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.620
Now then...

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.250
Shall we get started?

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.060
Here comes a big one, you think we can really do this?

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.930
First, we keep our distance and see what move he makes.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.730
Then we'll counter the attack and hit him

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.650
with a big blow as close as we can get.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.860
Nine Tails, you're acting like a captain.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.070
So? You got a problem with that?

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.990
Nope. In fact I feel kinda happy!

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:57.700
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu"

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.830
Save that line for after we've won!

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:09.420
THE ALLIED SHINOBI FORCES JUTSU Tune in again!
