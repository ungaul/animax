WEBVTT

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.860
Red vapor…

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.110
The unique vapor of blood

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.860
from the opening of all eight gates.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.110
But actually seeing it with my own eyes,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.900
it's almost like the color of dead autumn leaves

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.650
that have fallen off their tree.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.110
You're right.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.900
But they're not falling without reason or purpose.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.150
They become the nutrients… for fresh green leaves!

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.480
And the period they bridge,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.610
until the new spring when fresh leaves bud…

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.440
is the climax of youth!

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.280
When it burns most crimson!

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.980
The Eight Inner Gates Formation

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.940
First Step!

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.570
Go for it, Guy Sensei!

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.900
I can…

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.440
no longer…

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.070
Guy, is that your—?!

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.070
That is Sensei's Sekizo, the Evening Elephant!

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.360
Second Step!

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.360
He stopped midway?!

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.650
The Evening Elephant is supposed to be a continuous attack

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.940
that can be shifted up in speed from one to five times…

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.110
I see, what unbelievable pain.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.190
But I've acclimated.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.820
Next time, I can keep it going without giving him any openings.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.110
Great stress is placed on the body even through

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.110
the Fifth Gate, the Gate of Closing…

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.110
I bet the Gate of Death's level of pain

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.030
is something that exceeds my imagination!

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.940
A taijutsu move that bombards with blows of punched air…

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.190
An air cannon, so to speak…

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.440
Taking four or five of those would be bad.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.570
I should definitely avoid getting hit by the fists creating them too.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.980
Did he succeed?!

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.820
One rarely gets to fight the Eight Inner Gates Formation!

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.070
I'm game! I'll play with you!

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.190
I figured as much… He didn't bring him down yet.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.820
What has Might Guy done?

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.440
The Eight Inner Gates Formation…

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.320
A technique that allows one to draw out their maximum power

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.820
by releasing the limiters placed on it.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.900
It's the final stage of the jutsu Lee used against you

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.900
in the Chunin Exams long ago.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.110
Releasing all eight limiters results in power tens of times greater

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.360
than that of the Five Kage.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.320
But it's only temporary.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.280
After using this technique, the user will…

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.940
inevitably die.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.440
He's coming towards me by kicking air!

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.480
He is… my precious student whom I love.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.610
Lee, are you—?

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.030
I am not sad!

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.030
Showing any pity or sorrow to someone

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.730
who has resolved himself would be an insult!

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.110
We must assist Guy.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.070
Listen up.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.780
Sensei… Those black weapons of his are troublesome…

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.190
They're not the activating-from -nothing type,

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.980
but an always-on-standby type that undergo Change in Form.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.900
Their impact points disappear,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.230
but there is clear sensation if they make contact with you.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.030
Also, he can only send them about 70 meters out.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.400
Any further than that, and he'll lose control over them.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.480
Since they actually exist and can be seen with the eye,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.030
your Kamui should work on them.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.940
By sending them away,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.030
we can prevent Madara from controlling them.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.530
To be honest, I'm beginning to lose sight in my left eye.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.480
I'll have to get pretty close to target my Kamui accurately.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.070
Gaara, can you prepare some sand?

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.900
You want me to transport Kakashi with my sand, right?

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.230
But my sand isn't fast enough to avoid his attacks.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.360
Don't worry.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.530
That's where I come in.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.230
I'll have Kakashi carry one of my kunai.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.230
Eight Inner Gates: The Six Gate of Joy!

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.150
Open!

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.400
Lee!

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.980
You've mastered the Eight Inner Gates too?!

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.610
I can only open up to the Sixth Gate…

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.230
I've never cursed my own lack of power as I do now!

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.280
No… That's enough, Lee.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.230
Because you're still…

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.730
…a fresh new leaf Guy wants to risk his life to protect!

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.030
Lee, I want you to stay here to support and guard Gaara.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.940
And one more thing… Take one of my kunai.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.900
First Step!
He is fast!

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.400
Second Step!

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.690
Third Step!

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.030
Fourth Step!

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.610
I can't move!

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.110
Fifth Step!

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.480
Just keep forging on, Guy! No matter what!

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.780
Here he comes!

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.940
Great timing, Lee!

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:19.690
Kamui!

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.900
You're the first since Hashirama to make me feel this excited!

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.940
Can you still dance?

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.070
Do you have any other techniques?

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.190
Give me some more fun!

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.230
He got up from a barrage of Sekizo?

00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:59.650
Where am I?

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.860
Did I die?

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.980
What makes thee think that thou art dead?

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.860
Thine ethical viewpoint on death differs much

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.150
from that which prevailed in my time…

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.980
To so easily replace oneself with the term "death"…

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.980
Thou must gain mettle, oh fledgling.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.320
Who are you?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.320
'Tis quite a precise query for this place, but…

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.480
I am quite uneasy over whether thou shalt be able

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.570
to connect my name with my actions as a herald…

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.400
I am he who shall achieve peace and order…

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.820
My name is Hagoromo.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.030
On the other hand…

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.940
I had foreseen

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.360
that thou wouldst end up in such a state as that.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.360
Uh…I don't understand what the hell he's saying.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.900
He seems to be one of those annoying geezers!

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.900
Hey, gramps, sorry. But, I…

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:09.940
Now then…

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.730
Hey! Those eyes!

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.440
Rinnegan!

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.400
Thou dost appear to possess observant eyes.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.070
All that remains is for thee

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.230
to pragmatically comprehend thy circumstances.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.400
Thou hast not died yet…

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.400
This place is thine inner mind.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:29.900
I understand thine haste,

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.440
– This geezer's not an enemy? – but at this moment,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.940
– This geezer's not an enemy? – rushing will accomplish naught.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.780
But…

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.360
Can't you speak a little more smoothly, using easy, normal words?

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.940
I am an anachronism.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.530
Over the passage of much time,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.030
cultural traditions and notions, and ethics

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.070
have brought about significant change.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.820
Each occurrence where I cross time and meet a reincarnate,

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.400
I have come to sense greatly the differences

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.030
between the other and myself…

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.030
I was also able to formalistically regulate and

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.610
learn new mores and words, however…

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.150
Shut up already!

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.730
I don't have the time to be sitting around

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.610
and listening to some weird geezer!

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.650
Not just searching for words…

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.940
But there is ambiguity in scholarship.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.690
If communication of wills cannot be achieved

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.030
in addition to difficulty of definition…

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.360
I see that I must speak simply…

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.900
taking into account current idealistic and materialistic thinking.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.940
Are you an alien or something?

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.690
I mean, you seem super dignified, but…

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.440
Uh, that's a bit much, doncha think?

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.940
An alien? Seriously?

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.980
Well, maybe that ain't too far off. So anyway…

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.820
Do you still fail to understand me?

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.110
To think that conversation would pose such a complex challenge…

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.190
No! Keep talking like just now. I finally get you!

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.360
I was just shocked because

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.280
your speaking style changed so drastically, ya know?

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.820
Oh, for real?

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.820
Then I'll keep going like this. Much pleased!

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.360
Uh, yeah.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.280
Oh but, those words don't match up with your face at all,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.980
so it's kind of super-scary…

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.230
And he loses all dignity too.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.190
You should be just a bit more formal.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.110
Otherwise, you come off kind of dumb.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.320
Now you're going too far, no?

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.070
What do you mean by dumb?!

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.860
Well, considering how I was talking before,

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.690
I guess I can't blame you for that.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.980
So how's this then?

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.980
That's it! All right! That's perfect!

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.110
Indeed. I'm getting the hang of it too.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.980
Finally, I can talk with you.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.480
So anyway, gramps, who are you?

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.690
If you know a lot about this place,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.030
tell me how to get out of here!

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.440
Don't ask so many questions all at once!

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.900
I am a person of the past, someone long dead.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.190
A monk who wanders through this world as chakra,

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.070
crossing generations, ascertaining the course of Ninshu, the Ninja Creed.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.900
My name is Hagoromo, the founder of the Ninja Creed.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.150
I'm also known as the Sage of Six Paths.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.110
What?! The Sage of Six Paths?!

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.360
The sage from the legends that Pervy Sage and Nagato talked about?

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.730
Oh, so you know about me?

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.230
Of course I do!

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.860
You're the one who created ninjutsu, right?

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.320
Not ninjutsu… Ninshu, the Ninja Creed.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.190
My Ninja Creed was something meant to birth hope.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.030
Do not confuse it with ninjutsu which breeds conflict!

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.360
In any case, if you're the sage,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.150
I've got tons of things I wanna ask you.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.480
But first, right now…

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.360
You are my son Ashura's…

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.360
Anyway, the conditions are all in place now.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.480
There are things I must entrust you with.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.150
Ashu…ra? Entrust?

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.480
Quit talking gibberish and let me out of here!

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.070
Forgive me... That is something I have no influence over.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.030
That depends on the actions of those outside.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.110
I can only relay things to you.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.110
I'm not getting what you're saying again!

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.940
It means right now,

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.150
trying to rush won't make any difference.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:49.690
So I want you to listen for a bit… No, you must listen…

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.940
First, about my mother and sons.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.440
My mother, Kaguya Otsutsuki,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.400
came to this land of yours from a faraway place.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.820
She came in search of the fruit of the Divine Tree.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.860
The chakra fruit of that same Divine Tree,

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.690
that you have seen in this war.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.860
Kaguya consumed the fruit, attained power,

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.280
and subdued this land.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.110
Where'd Kaguya come from?

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.110
Is she stronger than you, Sage of Six Paths?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.690
I guess all moms are scary when they're mad, huh?

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.030
It matters not where she came from.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.940
Mother was powerful… More powerful than any other.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.940
Some called my mother the Rabbit Goddess

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.940
and others considered her a demon…

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.820
They both worshipped her and feared her.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.820
Later, Kaguya would birth two sons.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.360
I was one of them.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:56.570
We brothers, to atone for the crimes mother left behind,

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.150
battled Ten Tails, an incarnation of the Divine Tree,

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.440
and sealed it inside me.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.230
The Divine Tree, robbed of its Chakra Fruit,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.230
went on a rampage in an attempt to recover it.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.360
Much, much later, I had two sons of my own.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.820
I named the elder, Indra, and the younger, Ashura,

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.610
and I taught them the Ninja Creed.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.860
But there was a huge difference between the two.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.610
One possessed genes containing my powerful chakra

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.900
and the other did not.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.530
And this difference manifested itself in an extreme manner.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.730
It's getting complicated again, ya know?

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.400
What does this all mean?

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:39.980
In short…

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.650
There was the exceptional older brother, Indra…

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.070
and the dunce younger brother, Ashura.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.820
A dunce, huh?

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.980
Even though his dad's the Sage of Six Paths?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.530
Perhaps there's no need to say this to you, but…

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.320
No matter how exceptional both parents may be,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.190
there's no guarantee one will inherit outright either of their abilities.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.610
Sound familiar?

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.480
Just as it seems to have been in your case, Naruto.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.530
For some reason, I understand that completely.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:21.360
And you are truly similar to Ashura, in your actions as well.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.150
Huh? My actions?

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.280
Indra and Ashura walked different paths in life.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.280
Elder brother, Indra, possessed strong Visual Prowess

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.940
and senses from birth, and was called a genius.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.320
He always did everything alone, leaning only on his own strength

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.070
and came to understand that his powers were different and special.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.860
He perceived that power could achieve everything.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.860
On the other hand, nothing ever went well for the younger brother, Ashura,

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.730
from the time he was young.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.030
And he couldn't do anything on his own.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.940
In order to attain the same power as his older brother,

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.730
he needed the cooperation of others in addition to his own effort.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.940
While struggling through training,

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.190
the power of bodily chakra awakened within Ashura

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.570
and he attained power rivaling his brother's.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.780
He came to understand that he was able to become strong,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.360
thanks to the cooperation and help of those around him.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.070
He learned of the love for others that arises from thinking about others…

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.900
And perceived that it was love that can achieve everything.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.150
In the way that the younger one chose to live his life…

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.780
I thought I caught a glimpse of new possibilities.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.320
I partitioned the power of the Ten Tails inside of me,

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.110
and named each of the pieces…

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:48.190
And believed that the bond known as "cooperation" was true power.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.070
I then named the younger brother, Ashura,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:59.070
the leader and guardian of the Ninja Creed,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.900
believing that his elder brother, Indra, would cooperate with his younger brother.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.230
However…

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.860
Indra did not accept my decision.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.110
And thus from that day on,

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.610
…interminable conflict began.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.690
Even after their flesh perished, the chakra the two honed

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.440
continued to reincarnate across time,

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.070
without vanishing… over and over.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.900
It kind of sounds like being haunted by a ghost. It's creepy.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.940
So, is it still possessing someone even know?

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.980
It's you, Naruto.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.980
The younger brother Ashura has reincarnated as you.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.260
If all chakra were to be reunited into one again,

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.380
a new Chakra Fruit would take shape.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.920
That must be prevented at all costs,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.670
or this world would come to an end.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.550
I would like you to stop Madara.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.670
In your unpredictability, I feel the possibility exists.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.840
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Sage of Six Paths."

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.840
Thanks for believing in us.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.800
THE SAGE OF THE SIX PATHS Tune in again!
