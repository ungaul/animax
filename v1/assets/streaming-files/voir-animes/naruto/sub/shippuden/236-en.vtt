WEBVTT

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.130
Wind Style: Massive Rasen Shuriken!

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.530
Inferno Style: Susano'o Flame Control!

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.190
No... That's not what I meant.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.440
Only "Wind" can assist and magnify "Fire..."

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.190
Burn away!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.190
You heard what Sasuke said earlier, didn't you?

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.280
What are his true intentions?

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.150
I have no idea.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.230
Though still incomplete,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.070
the Ten Tails has been revived and is battling the Allied Forces.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.320
So I think that it's become quite a complex situation.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.370
It's gotten that bad...

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.500
In that case, we need to hurry!

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.960
I'll carry everyone with my sand.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.120
Please save your chakra.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.670
We came in mid-story. I want more details!

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.000
Ask about them while we're en route.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.460
Let's go as fast as we can... to the battlefield!

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.850
Kakashi vs. Obito

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.970
Then why do you work with Sasuke?

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.770
Because I exist to protect him.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.350
Sasuke! There are other Tailed Beasts inside that huge one!

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.020
Once it's weakened, shut off your Black Flames!

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.270
Then Kurama and I will pull them out of it!

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.350
No.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.430
They all burn.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.470
Hey! Don't you get it?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.180
If we don't save them now,

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.680
we'll end up facing a lot of trouble later on!

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.350
I'm going to put an end to this failing system currently in place!

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.390
And then, a new...

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.850
It detached the piece of itself that was on fire!

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.350
Sakura... Can I ask you something?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.220
Since I don't know him very well, I can look at this objectively.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.890
Sasuke cannot be trusted as a true comrade.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.930
What are your true feelings on the matter, Sakura?

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.520
Don't worry, Sasuke has come back to us.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.850
I'm happy about that. And I do trust him.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.930
Your words may not be lies...

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.220
But...

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.720
I can already tell that your smile is fake.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.560
What's up, Shikamaru?

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.220
It's nothing...

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.390
Obito...

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.680
Enough of these tricks...

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.850
I'm over it.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.350
No more genjutsu.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.850
Looks like I can't find anything that will change you.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.850
Right now, all I can give you...

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.720
...is death.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.100
Then I shall do the same.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.890
Come!

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.100
All right!

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.430
Shinobi Hand-to-Hand Combat!

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.720
Begin!

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.430
I'm going to borrow this.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.100
Fire Style... Fireball Jutsu!

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.970
Earth Style... Mud Wall!

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.560
The real one is here!

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.600
Hand-to-hand combat is over. Kakashi wins.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.350
Now perform the Unison Sign.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.600
Obito...

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.430
Your once strong will is still alive today, right next to me!

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.720
What the current me can do is protect the current Naruto!

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.970
You will...

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:22.430
Actually, everyone will eventually end up just like me.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.270
Sasuke is a Rogue Ninja. Standard procedure is to erase him.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.640
I'll bring back Sasuke!

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.390
Someone who can't even save one of their friends

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.430
could never become Hokage!

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.640
I'm going to surpass every Hokage who came before me!

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.470
- I'd never kill any of my friends! - I'd never kill any of my friends!

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.520
Naruto... You never waver.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.680
You're stronger than me and

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.470
you have many things that are solely yours.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.720
This is all I can do right now.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.890
And that is...

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.140
to protect this world, my comrades...

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.600
and the Obito of the past...

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.430
by killing...

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.020
the current Obito!

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.800
It's over, Obito.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.170
I'll let you win...

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.010
this battle.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.340
But I'm not conceding the war!

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.800
I thought I told you. I have no intention of fighting a clone.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.300
You can come at me with them, but they offer no resistance at all.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.800
You're concentrating too much power in your actual body.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:13.260
Madara... All the time, you kept holding something back...

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.590
That's...

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.630
Looks like that's of no use to me anymore.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.670
I wanted to fight Hashirama before I became a Jinchuriki...

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.970
I guess I have no choice.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.170
M-My body!

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.630
It's time to make him bring me back with Rinne Rebirth!

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.260
That's...!

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.800
Obito...

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:40.010
You're just a backup that I had cultivated for my rebirth.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.920
You saved me, Gramps?

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.510
Thank you.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.720
It's too early to thank me.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.510
I intend to have you... ...repay your debt.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.970
That time is now.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.590
He's being controlled by Madara's chakra!

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.800
The Six Paths Forbidden... Rinne Rebirth Jutsu?

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.300
Madara... He must not be allowed to fully return to life!

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.630
Lads!

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.300
You're all closer!

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.170
Stop the jutsu of the one on top of the Ten Tails right now!

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.010
Okay! Got—

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.420
Sasuke!

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.670
I see...

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.470
So that's how it is.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.340
Is this the maximum amount I can make inside this barrier?

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.670
Tobirama!

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.630
Okay!

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.340
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.880
Only two.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.970
Is this also the best I can do?

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.130
We'll just have to make do with this!

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:07.090
They can't get to Obito in time, so they're going to attack me...

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.760
They should know by now that I can't be stopped with clones.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.470
That's enough, Aoda! You can get out of here!

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.170
Yes, Lord Sasuke!

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.090
You won't always be like this either, right?

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.840
Don't give up.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.300
You love Rin, don't you?

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.510
We'll both become Hokage.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.420
Right, Obito?

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.590
Sensei...

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.170
Obito!

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.720
That...was you?

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.420
Which one is he?

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:36.590
What a failure!

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.220
But...oh well!

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.300
Did they succeed?!

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.800
That's Lord Fourth Hokage!

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.800
He teleported a Shadow Clone.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.760
Had he marked him already?

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.380
A Flying Raijin marking never disappears.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.670
I didn't teach you that, did I, Obito?

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.720
If you were alive,

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.880
I would have wanted you to become Hokage...

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.760
Why did you...?

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.800
That was disappointing...

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.970
All that's left to do is to seal the un-reborn Madara...

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.130
and this war will be over.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.800
As well as this giant thing.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.670
What makes you think the war is over...

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.590
my fellow traitor?

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.550
Dad! Sasuke!

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.630
Gamakichi!

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.720
Okay!

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.670
What? What's happening?!

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.010
Is the Ten Tails changing form again?

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.090
No, that's not what's happening!

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.590
He shook off Madara's manipulation and

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:33.420
was weaving the signs to do this from the beginning!

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800
That's...

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.220
...the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki!

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.070
Oh! I really want to know what happens next!

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.940
But the next episode will be a little breather.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.070
It's an "Extra Edition!"

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.280
Pain and Itachi appear again!

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.780
Even more, Deidara and Pervy Sage appear

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.980
and cause a big ruckus in the Leaf Village!

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.360
What kind of a story is this?

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.260
Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.400
"Extra Edition: The Directive to Take the Nine Tails!"

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.650
Just what in the world are you?

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.780
Tune in again!
