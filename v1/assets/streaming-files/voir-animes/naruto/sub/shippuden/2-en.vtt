WEBVTT

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.370
It's been a long time, you two.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.070
I'm sure your training produced good results, right?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.970
Do you think we came back without making progress?

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.730
It went perfectly!

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.030
Then show me those results immediately.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.970
Show you...?

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.200
You will take on a particular man.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.870
I didn't send him on any missions for the past several days

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.500
and had him stand by for this very purpose.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.100
Your opponent will be...

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.970
Come in!

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.430
Hello.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.370
Shikamaru! Temari! Look who's here!

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.870
Naruto.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.400
Hey! That is you isn't it, Naruto!

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.430
Shikamaru!

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.170
This is...that little shrimp...?

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.930
So you're back?

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.900
Yeah, I got back this morning.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.500
You don't look as stupid as before...

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.800
I mean, hey, have you changed?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.500
No, he hasn't.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.070
Oh...I thought so.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.900
Sakura.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.600
Then, does this mean you're my opponent, Shikamaru?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.130
Opponent? What do you mean?

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.800
I just came to deliver some documents.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.170
Huh? You're not my opponent, Shikamaru?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.500
Then...?

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.470
Who're you again?

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.970
You don't remember me?

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.900
Naruto, that's not your opponent.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.100
He's out there.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.630
You sure got tall...Naruto.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.770
Yo!

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.330
Kakashi Sensei!

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.000
The Akatsuki Makes Its Move 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.530
Sensei, you haven't changed one bit!

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.830
Oh yeah.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.000
Listen, listen... I've got a present for you, Sensei.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.630
This is sure a nostalgic sight.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.600
Yes, it is...

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.900
What?!

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.130
You got me... Th-This is...

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.400
This is the first new title in the Make-Out series in three years!

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.770
I think it's totally boring,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.400
but you like this stuff, don't you, Sensei?!

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.630
That idiot...No way could a kid understand the appeal.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.330
And on top of that,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.430
it's a very rare item that hasn't even been released yet...

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.300
All right! That's enough fun for now, Kakashi.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.300
Don't tell me... Are you my opponent...?

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.670
Hmm, not quite...

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.000
Gee, it's been a while since I saw you too, Sakura.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.100
Yes, it has, Kakashi Sensei.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.570
My opponent will be...

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.070
Naruto...and Sakura, the both of you!

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.130
Kakashi Sensei's our opponent...

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.470
I want to see what you can do against Kakashi...

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.530
I will determine your status in the future based on the results.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.430
Status, eh?

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.430
Sakura, show me that

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.000
you weren't just wasting your time training under me.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.630
Yes, ma'am!

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.670
Then, shall we get right to it?

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.670
That's what I'd like  to say.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.570
But since you just got back Naruto, you must be tired.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.500
I'll give you a short rest.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.730
I'm not particularly tired or anything!

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.770
Let's meet up at the Third Training Grounds later.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.500
See ya.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.700
Why's he in such a hurry?

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.000
I have a pretty good idea...

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.000
He's going to read his book.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.930
Oh!

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.830
With that look he had, there's no doubt about it.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.300
That's the obvious reaction

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.430
after getting an unreleased copy of one of my books.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.000
That Kakashi Sensei.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.000
Is that stupid book more important to him

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.830
than the results of our training?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.730
Well, now we can discuss our strategy against Kakashi Sensei.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.600
So, are you guys on a date?

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.870
It's not like that.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.600
Heh! Cut out the jokes.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.130
Why would I be on a date with this guy?

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.530
It's almost time for the Chunin Exams.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.300
I've just been going back and forth between the Sand and the Leaf

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.100
for meetings concerning the Exams.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.470
And although it's a pain,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.600
I've been put in charge of the Exams...

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.430
I've just been told to act as a guide for the Sand messenger.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.570
Chunin Exams, huh...?

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.800
That sure takes me back...

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.030
Oh...

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.630
So what're you going to do, Naruto?

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.000
About what?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.030
About the Chunin Exams.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.100
You're the only one from our class who hasn't become a Chunin.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.700
What?!

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.800
Th-Then, you're also a Chunin, Sakura?

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.900
Heh-heh...That's right.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.870
And just for the record, Kankuro, this person here,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.500
and Neji who's one grade above us are already Jonin.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.070
Huh?!

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.200
Then what about Gaara?!

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.500
Lord Kazekage... The meeting is about to begin.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.000
Okay.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:50.970
I see...

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.530
So Gaara became the Kazekage, huh...?

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.000
That's awesome...

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.530
I won't be outdone!

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.270
I'll become the Hokage, no matter what!

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.370
Just you wait, Gaara!

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.400
I guess... he has matured a little, after all.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.870
What do you think?! Pretty good, huh...?

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.930
It is my finest work.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.230
I leave Naruto in your care as promised...

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.070
It'd be nice if he's grown at least a little.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.230
Heh... You'd think I've slipped up?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.630
You'll get beaten out if you get careless.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.330
Well, that's encouraging to hear.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.330
And their actions are gaining momentum.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.700
Over the past several years,

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.870
the strength of our village has stabilized,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.630
and relations with the Hidden Villages in each allied land have prospered.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.730
In particular, we have achieved good results

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.100
in our development of recruits with the curriculum incorporating...

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.030
the training program from the Leaf Village.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:38.130
The Chunin Exams are almost here. I look forward to the results.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.930
However... at this time, with the Chunin Exams upon us,

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.530
there is a nasty rumor going around...

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.500
What is it, Yura?

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.630
Have you heard of the organization called the "Akatsuki"?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.230
I see... So they're finally making their move.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.470
It's something we were expecting to a degree, though.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.370
The Akatsuki, huh...?

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:16.070
The Akatsuki is a mysterious organization composed of a dozen or so Shinobi.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.200
The members of the organization are vicious S-Rank criminals

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.470
all listed in the Bingo Book.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.270
Of those identified...

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.800
there is Itachi Uchiha from the Village Hidden in the Leaves

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.530
who drove his own clan to annihilation in one night.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.170
There is Kisame Hoshigaki

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.500
who was once a member of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.470
He was known as the phantom of the Mist.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.630
And there is Orochimaru

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.930
who once plotted the destruction of the Leaf...

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.100
and assassinated the previous Kazekage.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.870
It is said he used to be a member of this organization.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.730
Why have they started taking such dramatic action?

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.500
What's their goal?

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.730
That's beyond me at this point... What I do know...

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.170
is that they're after what's inside Naruto.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:17.330
And...that they've got something evil in mind.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.900
I passed on this information

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.930
to those in charge of security for each land.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.100
I sure hope they tighten up their security immediately.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.970
I see... I'd heard the rumors...

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.330
So the organization in question is finally taking action...

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.770
The source of the information is Lord Jiraiya,

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.330
one of the legendary Sannin.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.230
So prior to the meeting,

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.730
I took the liberty of issuing an order to increase Village security.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.170
Anbu Black Ops masters have already been stationed

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.570
at key points around the village.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.770
No matter how powerful the Shinobi may be,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.270
they will not be able to infiltrate by force.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.100
I hear the members of the Akatsuki wear black clothing

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.200
in addition to capes with a red cloud pattern on them.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.230
I ordered security to attack with full force

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.630
should they see someone fitting that description.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.070
Now then... the meeting is adjourned.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.900
Well done, Yura.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.330
I never thought you'd take action so quickly.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.230
I have also served as a superior for four years.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.300
It is my intention...

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.000
to always make decisions while considering...

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.170
what's in the best interest... of the...village.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.130
SEAL

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.670
What's the matter?

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.200
Nothing... It's nothing at all...

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.500
I just haven't slept much...

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.900
I see...You need to take care of yourself.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.270
Thank you for your concern.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.000
I see... That's right...

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.470
I see. So we have to deal with this one,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.600
then go after the guy we sent to Orochimaru, huh?

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:43.130
It seems he turned traitor and leaked information about us.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.870
It can't be helped.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.030
Even I don't know what happens after the Jutsu is cast.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.700
More importantly, will just that bag be enough?

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.130
Our opponent will be using the Jinchuriki.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.470
All of my Jutsu are works of art.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.600
And I made sure to bring my specialty.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.930
After all, our opponent is the One-Tailed.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.100
Third Training Grounds

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.970
Is Kakashi Sensei going to make us wait forever?!

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.500
Well, he's always been like this.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.930
Geez, it'd be nice if he'd show a little improvement.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.370
Oh, sorry about that.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.000
As it happens, I ran into an old woman in trouble on my way here and...

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.470
- Okay! That's a lie! - Okay! That's a lie!

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.600
This place... kind of takes me back.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.630
Your task for today is

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.930
to take these bells away from me by this afternoon.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.770
Those unable to get a bell will get no lunch.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.530
What?!

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.300
You'll be tied to those posts and

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.200
then I'll eat your lunch right in front of you.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.670
Oh, come to think of it,

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.970
this was your first Training Ground, wasn't it?

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.230
Squad Seven...

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.330
The Three-Man Squad, huh...?

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.070
We had Sasuke with us... back then, didn't we?

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.600
Don't go!

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.100
If you do, I'll scream...!

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.270
Sakura.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.330
Thanks.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.430
Sasuke.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.530
Sasuke!

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.330
Yo, goofball.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.430
Sasuke's name is off limits for these guys...

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.830
Well... Let's see how much you've grown.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.700
You haven't given up on Sasuke, have you?

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.100
Absolutely not!

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.070
That's why I continued my training!

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.130
The rules are the same as when we first met.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.200
I don't care how you do it. Just take a bell away from me.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.200
- If you don't... - "come at me with the intent to kill,"

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.800
"we won't be able to get the bells", right?

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.970
You can use Shuriken if you want.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.670
If you don't come at me with the intent to kill,

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.200
you won't be able to get the bells.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.370
Exactly.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.700
If you don't come at me with the intent to kill,

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.800
you won't be able to get the bells.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.530
You have until sunrise tomorrow.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.600
Now then, shall we begin?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.270
You're not going to do it

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.530
while reading your book this time around, Kakashi Sensei?

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.930
Or have you already finished reading?

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.670
Nope... I thought I'd save the fun for later...

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.870
Besides... Well, I kind of get the feeling...

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.800
I may have to...

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.800
get a bit serious this time around.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:33.830
What's that...?

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.500
Black clothing and a red cloud pattern.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.970
Don't tell me...

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.370
Is that...?

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.970
Contact Captain Yura immediately!

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.170
Captain Yura!

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.400
Some guys from the organization in question have shown up.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.730
I know.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.570
You don't need to worry... It'll be over soon.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.730
Good work, Yura.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.300
Do you remember me?

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.600
Yes, Lord Sasori!

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.530
Let's go!

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.030
The time to unveil my newest work has come.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.100
It's been three years since my previous masterpiece,

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.600
"Make-Out Violence."

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.770
You'll forget about time, forget to breathe, and forget yourself with this,

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.830
a masterpiece filled with soul.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.000
Pre-orders for "Make-Out Tactics"

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.270
are now being accepted at the Leaf Shuueidou.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.730
Buy it now, everyone! Okay?

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.770
Stop advertising your book here!

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.600
Next time: "The Results of Training"
