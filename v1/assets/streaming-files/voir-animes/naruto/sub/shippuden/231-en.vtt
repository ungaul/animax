00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.140
Sasuke's Answer

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.890
This time...

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.930
you're not going to reach the other side!

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.770
I'm the one still standing.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.560
Opposite from the last time.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.890
I just want to protect...

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.810
the dream I finally realized.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.350
I don't want anymore...

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.770
You look pretty depressed, Hashirama.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.980
Can't perk back up this time, eh?

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.480
Can't we show each other our guts?

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.310
The first steps are for us to not give up on our ideals

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.640
and to get a lot stronger.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.640
Let's build our settlement here!

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.730
They say where there's a will, there's a way...

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.810
And yet, I...

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.140
That dream is now becoming reality.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.100
A Wood Style Clone...

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.680
I can't believe my back was taken...

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.430
I will protect our...no, my village.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.850
No matter what.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.100
I still believe to this day that protecting the village

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.600
will lead to the protection of the people, shinobi, and children!

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.560
I will not forgive anyone who threatens the village.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.640
Be they a friend...sibling... or even my own child...

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.640
You've changed...Hashirama.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.730
I made up my mind right then...

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.680
to endure in order to watch over the present.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.140
You've got your priorities backwards.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.930
Ultimately... It shall someday lead the village to darkness.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.730
And thus...my battle with Madara came to an end.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.930
I don't know how Madara returned to life now.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.730
I definitely killed my friend...

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.730
For the sake of the village.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.350
That's right...

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.060
The village...

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.230
that Madara and I first envisioned...

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.640
is something that joined one clan to another.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.850
It was an invaluable cornerstone that created order out of chaos,

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.640
then maintained it.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.140
It protected the children and averted pointless conflict.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.390
It made peace a reality.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.640
However...it gave rise to despair,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.730
the kind that your brother Itachi was forced to bear.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.640
Perhaps what Madara said was correct, after all.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.270
Perhaps he foresaw this state of affairs.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.640
I am the shinobi who created these circumstances.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.600
Furthermore, I am also the one who considered them acceptable.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.430
I believe that shinobi are those who endure for a purpose.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.730
But depending on what that purpose is, a shinobi can change.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.270
Just as Madara...and I did.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.810
Shinobi...

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.680
Shinobi are those who endure...

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.140
in order to achieve their goals.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.480
For me, it was building a village.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.600
But it seems Madara found something else.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.520
This plan of Madara's that Orochimaru mentioned earlier...

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.600
To erase all the shinobi in this world...

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.930
I don't know what that means in literal terms, but...

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.770
It's the Infinite Tsukuyomi

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.520
where village, shinobi, and citizen are all irrelevant.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.680
He intends to put everyone under genjutsu

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.060
and manipulate them as he sees fit.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.060
To negate everything that my older brother, Madara's younger brother...

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.680
and all of you...

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.600
have tried to protect.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:23.480
My older brother inherited your will without even talking to you.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.180
My older brother...

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.640
Itachi... You also serve as the Uchiha Clan's pipeline

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.810
to the Village nerve center.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.140
You know that, don't you?

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.890
Even as he shouldered that heavy responsibility for the clan...

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.600
We cannot allow such a thing!

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.270
If they are going to start a revolution and usurp our power,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.600
we have no choice but to judge the Uchiha as traitors of the Leaf!

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.850
Wait, Koharu.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.520
Don't rush to such a decision.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:06.060
But Hiruzen, the Uchiha Clan will not be dissuaded.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.560
We must take measures to avoid mayhem.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.890
And that includes innocent children.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.430
Do not say such things before Itachi!

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.680
Besides, taking on the Uchiha will be no easy task.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.520
There's got be some sort of strategy we can use!

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.770
We have no time to waste.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.520
We must strike preemptively, before they have a chance to act.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.730
If we join forces with our respective ANBU Black Ops

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.600
and launch a surprise attack from behind,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.350
it will be over in no time.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.430
The Uchiha are old comrades in arms.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.520
I want to settle this with words first before force.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.390
I will come up with a strategy.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.640
Itachi...

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.430
Buy me some time, however little it may be.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.810
He stood between the village and the clan in their strife...

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.730
I see... So you've aligned with the other side?

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.430
Father, Mother...

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.770
I... I know, Itachi.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.890
Itachi, just promise me this.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.600
Take care of Sasuke.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:34.810
I will.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.270
Do not fear.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.020
This is the path you have chosen.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.850
Compared to you, our pain will be over in an instant.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.850
Even if our philosophies differ, I am proud of you.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.640
You are truly a kind child.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.850
He even killed his own parents...

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.560
We received intel that Itachi Uchiha of the Akatsuki is dead.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.810
Put a mark on his image and remove him from your Bingo Book.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.270
So that traitor is dead at last.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.600
But Captain, who was able to kill him?

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.640
Looks like it was his younger brother, Sasuke.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.520
How ironic...

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.520
His own brother killed the one who slaughtered their kin.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.770
Serves him right!

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.020
After that atrocious thing he did!

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.310
Not only that, he joined up with the Akatsuki

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.100
and came after the Leaf Village!

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.810
He's the most notorious villain in Hidden Leaf history!

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.600
I wish we got our hands on him first!

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.680
He was forced to kill his own clan and

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.850
endure the brand as a Rogue Ninja...

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.640
Yet, he continued to keep an eye on the organization

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.890
that wanted to harm the village.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.310
And even in death...

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.480
I'll have protected my village

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.100
as Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf once again.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.770
I have no more regrets.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.770
My older brother endured longer and harder than you.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:20.520
And died stating he was proud to be Leaf Shinobi.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.230
Isn't it ironic that the shinobi who understood you more than anyone else...

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.930
was from the Uchiha Clan?

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.850
Your brother was not the only one.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.680
I had a subordinate named Kagami Uchiha

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.770
who was much like your brother.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.520
Second Hokage... I thought you despised the Uchiha.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.640
That's not entirely true.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.850
I treated anyone who posed a danger to the village,

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.810
no matter what clan they belonged to, with extreme caution.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.930
And there's no doubt that the Uchiha Clan warranted my suspicions...

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.180
The Uchiha just happened to be a clan

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.640
particularly disposed to be considered as such.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.480
But, it is also because they could feel such deep love

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.270
that there were quite a few Uchiha over the years

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.640
like your brother and Kagami...

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.390
who could transcend the boundaries of the clan

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.980
and devote themselves to the village.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.680
My elder brother believed the village

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.930
was something that could eliminate the framework of clans.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.930
Well, the reality is... This wasn't so simple.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.430
The idealism of my elder brother Hashirama...

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.770
And the danger that Madara posed...

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.430
Mediating between these two things,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.810
and protecting and strengthening the village

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.140
were my duties as the Second Hokage.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.560
Shisui Uchiha was a descendant of Kagami Uchiha.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.680
He was a friend of your older brother Itachi.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.810
Many, including myself, embraced the First Hokage's Will of Fire.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.850
But perhaps, I was more naïve than any other shinobi.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.230
I wasn't able to continue the Second Hokage's task

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.980
of village-building skillfully enough.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.140
Which is how I ended up burdening Danzo with the village's darkness.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.520
I killed Danzo in vengeance.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.930
Until the end, he spoke that he would protect the village,

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.810
no matter how dirty the means.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.560
It seems I've failed miserably time after time as the Hokage.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:27.810
I guess I'm responsible for creating the situation that exists now.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.810
No... You're not to blame, Lord Third.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.980
You did everything you could for the sake of the village respectably.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.680
I'm the one who died during the Nine Tails' attack on the village!

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.980
You had such high hopes for me as the Hokage...

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.140
And I couldn't live up to them.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.730
I'll say... After he passed over me and picked you.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.390
Everyone was so disappointed.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.140
Lord Orochimaru... You sound like you're pouting.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.980
A little...since the Third Hokage is right here.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.560
Had I lived, perhaps I could have helped to foil

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.980
the Uchiha's plans for a coup d'état much sooner...

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.640
Now then... Sasuke...

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.020
What will you do?

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.770
Will you destroy the village?

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.730
Or...

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.770
Sorry, Sasuke...

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.560
Let's do it some other time.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.850
Sorry, Sasuke. Let's do it next time...

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.940
You probably hate me, huh?

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.350
But, we only have each other as siblings.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.730
I'm always going to be there for you,

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:58.440
even if it's only as an obstacle for you to overcome.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.480
Even if you do hate me...

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.640
That's what big brothers are for.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.850
You all suspect me?

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.600
There is no value in killing you now... my foolish little brother.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.140
If you wish to kill me, resent me, hate me,

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.560
and survive...in obscurity.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.770
I did what you said...

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.810
I resented you and hated you...

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.310
and I survived just so I...

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.730
so I could kill you!

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.230
I have no interest in someone like you...

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.480
You're weak, because you don't have enough...

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.100
hate.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.600
I always lied to you and asked you to forgive me.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.890
Deliberately keeping you at a distance by my own hand.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.270
All because I didn't want you to get caught up in any of this.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.350
But now, I believe...

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.640
That perhaps you could have changed

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.190
Father, Mother, and the rest of the Uchiha.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.770
If I had been open with you from the start...

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.690
And looked you straight in the eyes and told you the truth,

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.390
then I wouldn't have had to stand before you,

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.690
from above, as a failure, telling you all of this.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.940
So this time... I want to impart this truth to you...

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.270
You don't ever have to forgive me.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.100
And no matter what you do from here on out, know this...

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.980
I will love you always.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.270
I'm going to the battlefield!

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.560
I won't let the village, and Itachi become nothing!

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.520
It's been decided then!

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.640
Tobirama!

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.230
Prepare to fly us outside!

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.730
Even if I wanted to use Flying Raijin, I'm bound right now.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.770
Orochimaru, was it? What will you do?

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.810
You said earlier that you'd follow Sasuke.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.520
Of course... We will accompany him.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.690
What?!

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.690
J-Jugo, what about you?

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:06.770
I'm going too.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.690
It's my job to protect Sasuke.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:14.100
Four super-strong zombies... Three monsters...

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.560
If I tag along, I'm dead for sure!

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.690
I'm making a break for it when I see a chance!

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.690
This view brings back memories!

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:28.980
It's now or never!

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.690
What the hell?!

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.690
It's you after all, Sasuke!

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.890
I sensed your chakra and I couldn't believe it,

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.690
so I backtracked and look what I find!

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:40.600
Karin...

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:46.480
Oh my... So many of my best experiments gathered here in one place!

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.810
You bastard...!

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.980
I'll never forgive you!

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.850
I'm sorry, Karin.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:03.190
You bastard! As if a simple apology will get you off the hook...

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.060
you good for nothing...

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.890
I see you still have a weakness for Sasuke, Karin...

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.350
Listen, Lord Orochimaru!

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.440
Sasuke...had the gall... to stab me and...

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.100
What a coincidence. Me too.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.140
But I'm helping Sasuke now.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.640
This is perfect timing. You help too.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.850
What?!

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.600
I guess I have no choice... Who is she?

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.560
Judging from the chakra and that red hair...

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.440
She's from the Uzumaki Clan.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.890
One more idiot joins the pack.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.440
I bet Madara will be surprised.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.810
Orochimaru... Why did you decide to help Sasuke?

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.140
You were trying to destroy the village.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.600
After being inside Kabuto, I realized something...

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.270
He imitated the way I lived and tried to possess everything,

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.020
and failed.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.980
So now, I'm just curious about the different path Sasuke has chosen.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.350
Unlike Kabuto, Sasuke didn't copy me.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.190
Fellow Hokage!

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.940
As we stand atop the Great Stone Faces

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.600
that have watched over the Hidden Leaf...

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.640
Let us burn this sight of the village into our memory!

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.730
I'm finally going to see my son.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.980
Naruto, I wasn't able to do anything for you as a father...

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.390
I'll make it up to you by bringing you a huge present.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.600
All right! It's been a while since my last war!

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.310
I'd better be on my toes!

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.520
Madara... We'll defeat you this time for sure!

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.100
This may sound foolish,

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.690
but I'm kind of looking forward to seeing my old friend!

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.310
Just you wait, Madara!

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.940
There's always conflict, no matter what the era.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.190
But this shall be the end of wars!

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.020
Let's go!

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.660
Obito, you once dreamed of becoming Hokage.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.660
I can't see you not understanding Naruto's feelings!

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.700
You can still go back!

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.950
It's because I understand Naruto's mind...

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.520
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Hole"

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.630
...that I want to negate everything that he does!

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:08.530
HOLE Tune in again!
