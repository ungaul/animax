WEBVTT

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.270
Who're they?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.800
Oh, that's...

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.670
Granny Chiyo...and Ebizo.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.970
No way. I thought they were supposed to have long since been retired.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.600
Treatment Room 3

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.900
Oh, we have been expecting you.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.970
Please enter.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.570
I think you all know who these people are.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.400
This is Lady Chiyo and Lord Ebizo.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.530
- Hello. - Welcome.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.200
Hm? If I'm not mistaken, this is...

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.730
It's Kankuro.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.030
The current Kazekage's older brother.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.570
Oh, that's right.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.730
You checked his blood, right?

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.800
Y-Yes. Please look at this.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.400
I've never seen... composition like this before.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.170
Yes. We believe it might be a new type of poison.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.870
Have you tried an antidote?

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.030
For the time being, we tried using what we had.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.970
But none had any identifiable effects.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.930
I see...

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.500
Ordinarily, he would just finish the job...

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.770
It appears he's very confident about his poison.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.970
Leaving his prey as is on purpose is just like Sasori.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.530
Finally we're out of the Sand.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.400
I hate making people wait... Let's hurry.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.330
Good grief. Whose fault was it that it took this long?

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.670
That goes for both of us.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.900
Oh yeah.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.670
Sealing Jutsu: Nine Phantom Dragons 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.100
All right.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.000
This one didn't work, either.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.730
You haven't tried anything else?

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.270
For the time being,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.430
we have requested the Leaf for a specialist team to be dispatched.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.070
It would be best to wait for their arrival.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.730
Talk about depending on others.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.400
This happened because you depend on alliances with other lands

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.700
and conduct nothing but slipshod education.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.630
It is not...our intention to depend on others.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.500
I guess it can't be helped...

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.970
It's his fault for losing his cool and pursuing too far.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.830
A Shinobi is the last person who should do that ...

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.200
What's the point of trusting and being totally dependent

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.900
on the likes of the Leaf?

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.100
Improving the strength of your own village should be your top priority.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.600
They are them, we are us.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.200
Listen. An amicable alliance is nothing but a pipe dream.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.870
At times like this, the most we can expect

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.070
is for them to send us some useless underlings for form's sake.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.100
That would never happen... That's how it goes.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.830
Everyone looks out for themselves.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.400
Okay, break's over.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.130
Huh? Kakashi Sensei, where's Naruto?

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.800
Up there.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.130
One more day until we get to the Sand.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.800
We have to hurry.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.200
Okay, let's get going.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.200
This is not good.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.800
Poisons are my specialty, but even I can't figure this out.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.470
Even you, Lady Chiyo...?

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.700
At best, he has one day...

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.970
He may not even make it to dawn tomorrow, I'd say.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.570
That Sasori has sure grown considerably.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.470
What in the world should we do?

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.730
Well, the only one who might know more about antidotes than me

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.770
would be the Leaf's slug princess, Tsunade.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.670
I had a lot of trouble with her during the great war.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.330
She would decipher all the poisons I created and concoct antidotes.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.570
And now we're allies with the Leaf.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.870
All we can do is send for her and have her look at Kankuro.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.200
But she is now the Hokage

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.600
and would not be able to leave her village so easily.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.300
And even if she were to come,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.830
it takes three days to get here from the Leaf.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.370
I know. Nobody's seriously thinking of summoning her.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.100
I don't like that slug girl, anyway.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.000
Are you okay, Lady Tsunade?

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.430
Yeah.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.470
There's a cold going around, so please take care.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:42.900
Thanks.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.800
It's been two days since Team Kakashi left.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.600
They should be arriving tomorrow morning.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.700
This is a bad sign.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.230
Don't tell me...!

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:13.170
Group 3, 117037... I knew it.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.400
I won. And first prize at that.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.000
This is really a bad omen.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.530
Shizune. Are you there, Shizune?

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:25.730
All right!

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.630
It's the desert!

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.400
The Village Hidden in the Sand is up ahead.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.670
I'll take the lead from here.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.970
We're counting on you.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.670
We're here.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.800
Let's go.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.900
You're late. Prepare immediately.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.700
The Jinchuriki was unexpectedly strong.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.700
All right, gather.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.830
Now, let us begin.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.600
We will soon be done removing the traps and rocks from the road.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:30.830
Good work.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.030
We are currently working on gathering the bodies.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.930
But there is one thing that is a matter of concern.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.970
What is it?

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.570
We have not yet found Captain Yura.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.800
What?

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.030
It is clear that the Captain was heading for the road

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.330
before the incident.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.270
We have not even found a scrap of his clothing,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.270
let alone his body.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.070
That's strange.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.800
He's either slipped past the enemy and is in pursuit,

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.330
or perhaps nobody noticed that he was killed.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.930
I'd like to send backup for him if he's still alive.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.630
But if we don't know where he is...

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.970
Did you call me, Lady Tsunade?

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.370
Yes...

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.970
I want to send reinforcements to the Village Hidden in the Sand.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.530
Reinforcements?

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.870
They should be about done with their previous mission

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.330
and on their way back by now.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.400
Them?

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.470
Oh. Yes, ma'am. I'll make the preparations immediately.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.570
Can the worst-case scenario be considered?

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.330
From now, it will take three days and three nights.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.100
Keep your attention to your real body as well.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:55.070
And Zetsu, you keep watch on the outside with the body for the time being.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.730
Use the longest range.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.670
I know.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.370
Three days?

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.700
Shouldn't we consider that it might take a bit longer

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.100
since we don't have Orochimaru?

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.330
If that's what you think, then get right to it.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.530
That's true.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.300
Indeed.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.970
That sounds good.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.230
Spirit

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.930
Blue

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.230
White

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.570
Red

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.400
Boar

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.100
South

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.930
North

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.700
Three

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.700
Sphere

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.330
Sealing Jutsu: Nine Phantom Dragons.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.430
Lady Tsunade.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.800
They have returned from their mission!

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.330
All right.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.970
Oh, just a minute, Lady Tsunade.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.430
I'm giving you guys an S-rank mission!

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.730
- Huh? - No way.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.230
S-rank?

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.200
- Mission? - Don't tell me...

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.800
All right! We got an S-rank mission!

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.130
I can't believe it...

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.530
Our ability has finally been acknowledged!

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.500
I-It can't be!

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.830
Are you okay, Ebisu Sensei?

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.370
Well, I spent a bit too long soaking in the hot spring, you see.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.230
More like you were peeping.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.930
Here this is the first S-rank mission for us since we became Ninja.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.670
Don't be catching a cold, you closet pervert!

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.900
What's with these guys?

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.600
This is the wrong room, Lady Tsunade. They're over here.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.330
Geez, how confusing.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.370
What about our S-rank mission?

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.630
It was a misunderstanding... Thank goodness.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.000
I'm giving you guys the same mission as Team Kakashi.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.870
Head for the Sand and complete the mission

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.570
by providing backup for Kakashi and the others.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.530
Got it?!

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.570
Yes, ma'am!

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.130
Please leave it to us.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.200
Roger.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.170
Understood.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.400
All right!

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.770
Team Guy heading into action.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.000
You catch a cold?

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.130
No, my hay fever started acting up before...

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.000
All right, we'll make it to the Sand in one day.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.270
Sensei, let's make it in half a day.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.630
It'll take three days, no matter how you consider it.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.370
Please stop your conversations with that carried-away mood...

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.230
All right, we're leaving!

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.970
Together with me, everyone. The dash of youth!

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.600
Yes, Guy Sensei!

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.330
How embarrassing.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.370
Give it up, Tenten.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.530
They're as energetic as ever.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.700
It's sure been awhile since we've seen Naruto.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.400
I'm looking forward to seeing how much he's grown.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.800
Yeah.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.000
Here we're so close to the Village Hidden in the Sand...

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.830
I can't just sit around waiting!

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.270
Naruto, I told you not to lose your patience.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.700
But...!

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.970
Be patient. Right now, Temari is the one who's the most anxious.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.870
The ironclad rule is to stay put right there

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.770
if you encounter a sandstorm.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.370
You lose your sense of direction in a sandstorm.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:14.800
We often hear of people

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.530
dying of dehydration after getting lost in the desert.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.830
It'll be okay.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.400
A sandstorm around this time of year shouldn't last too long.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.370
Please let up soon.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.230
Kankuro...

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.170
Give him a sedative.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.970
Okay.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.130
All we can do now is ease his pain...

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.570
Our only ray of hope is the Leaf Shinobi who are scheduled to arrive tomorrow.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.330
If they have a poison specialist with them...

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.600
If Kankuro can hold on that long, of course.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.430
The road from the Leaf is currently impassable due to a sandstorm.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.970
In the worst case, they could arrive several days late.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.700
If that happens, then it's hopeless.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.170
This is pathetic...

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.930
I can't believe the day has come when we have to rely on the aid of the Leaf.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.570
Aren't you tired, Big Sister? Let's have a seat outside.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.470
You haven't had a wink of sleep since yesterday, right?

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.300
It's so sad, having to depend on the Leaf...

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.500
Big Sister.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.370
She fell asleep, huh?

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.870
If they're early, the help from the Leaf should be arriving pretty soon.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.100
But even a local wouldn't be able to get here quickly

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.770
with yesterday's sandstorm.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.730
Hey, what's that?

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.230
Oh!

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.900
We've been expecting you.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.900
So you were with them, Temari?

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.630
Please, come this way.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.170
What?! They got Kankuro, too?

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:31.100
Yes, Lord Kazekage was taken and Kankuro followed in pursuit.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:35.100
Kankuro was poisoned by the enemy and we don't know how to neutralize it.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.000
At this rate... he won't...

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.130
Damn it!

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.670
Let's hurry, Temari.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:44.770
I'll take a look at him.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.770
Treatment Room 3

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.230
Kankuro!

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.030
Kankuro!

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.170
He's...the White Fang of the Leaf!

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.300
You jerk!

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.000
Huh?

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.400
Prepare yourself!

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.900
Medical Emergency 24 hours.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.400
Today we're reporting live from the Hidden Sand Medical Facility.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.270
It appears that a new patient has been brought in just now.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.530
The patient is a 17-year-old Jonin, poisoned, and in critical condition.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.430
Oh, his Kumadori make up is being washed off!

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.100
The surgeon seems to be a girl.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.100
Can such a young doctor handle this?

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.830
It looks like the toxin is being sucked out...however!

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.030
Despite their medical efforts,

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.570
it appears they have just lost the patient.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.670
Hey, don't kill me off just like that!

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.470
Next time: "The Medical Ninja's Student"
