00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.630
Hagoromo and Hamura

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.250
Mother loved this world. She tried to love humans.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.960
But her wish was dashed

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.540
so she ate the fruit of the Divine Tree to try to protect her children.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.500
However…

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.960
Mother's real tale of despair begins from here…

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.290
Shortly afterwards, Mother gave birth to twins.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.040
They were…Hagoromo and Hamura.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.130
Mother looks up at the sky like that every day…

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.580
I wonder what she's looking for?

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.960
She never tells us anything. No one knows what's in her heart.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.420
Perhaps she has feelings that even we, her own sons, cannot fathom.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.960
Hey, Hagoromo and Hamura! Please come with me!

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.130
What's the matter, Haori?

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.710
If you use all the water at your place,

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.580
there won't be any water downstream for the rice paddies.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.500
That's not my fault!

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.830
Wait! What's going on?

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.830
I'll tell ya what's going on! This guy is taking all the water!

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.170
My paddy's upstream, so I can't help it!

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.670
But until now, wasn't there enough water for everyone?

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.830
Well, all of a sudden, the flow of the river's gotten weak.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.500
Did something happen upstream?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.500
I would go and check,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.330
but there's a huge bear roaming around this mountain.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.670
You gotta be really careful.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.130
Just recently, an old lady went foraging for edible wild plants,

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.710
and got hurt really bad.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.880
All right. We'll go check.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.210
Really? That'd be great!

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.460
Be careful, Hagoromo.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.040
We'll be fine.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.420
Let's go, Hamura.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.330
Right.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.330
See anything?

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.960
Hold on a minute.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.580
There's a huge boulder upstream.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.670
I see…

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.290
So this is what's blocking the flow of the river.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.330
But where did this boulder come from?

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.670
It wasn't there the last time we were up here.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.830
Either it fell from somewhere, or someone put it there.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.920
What do you bean by "someone"?

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.790
No one can move a boulder this big

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.960
other than Mother and you, Elder Brother.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.080
I put it there.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.500
Hey, don't brush me off like I'm some sort of bug…

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.210
‘Cuz I'm not a bug… I'm a toad.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.920
Hey, am I going crazy?

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.630
There's a toad trying to make bad jokes…

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.290
Well, Elder Brother, it must mean I'm going crazy too.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.960
No, you're not going crazy. I really am talking to you.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.500
But if you think my jokes aren't funny, then that's a little crazy.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.290
No one's hiding around here…

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.750
It's not some Ventriloquism Jutsu either.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.880
You're pretty wary for a human.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.290
You're pretty arrogant for a toad.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.920
We toads have lived here far longer than you.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.380
You just don't know it.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.500
A talking toad…

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.630
You think people will be happy if we captured it and took it home?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.080
Fool!

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.290
Do you really think you both can catch me?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.380
For a toad, you sure talk big…

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.330
It seems we have a guest.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.130
That's a huge bear!

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.500
Perfect timing. I'll show you just how strong I am.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.420
I placed this boulder here so I could meet you two.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.750
My name is Gamamaru.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.380
And you two are Hagoromo and Hamura, right?

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.670
A toad just addressed us by our first names…

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.170
Come with me, you two.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.790
Oops, I almost forgot.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.210
Oh… Not bad.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.460
Why did you bring us here?

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.170
Do you know what that is?

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.880
Of course.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.960
That's the Peak of Demise.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.420
Have you ever seen what's beyond that?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.580
No, never.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.250
Mother has warned us not to go near that peak.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.420
Everyone must follow that law.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.380
No one has ever seen what's on the other side.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.880
The truth behind the Divine Tree is beyond that peak.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.500
The truth behind the Divine Tree?

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.000
The Divine Tree has been absorbing the power of this land.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.790
As long as that tree exists, the land will continue to weaken.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.330
Is that true?

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.080
But I've heard that it's because of the power of the Divine Tree

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.250
that this land has thrived.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.000
You're wrong!

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.580
If you want to know the truth,

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.040
go see what's on the other side of that peak.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.880
Later!

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.540
"The truth"?

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.130
Is Lady Kaguya really not here?

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.330
How many times must I tell you? She's not here.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.500
Welcome home, Masters Hagoromo and Hamura.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.460
What's the matter?

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.250
This man is very persistent.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.790
Who are you?

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.250
I'm a traveling medicine peddler.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.670
I wanted to do some business here

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.380
and came to get Lady Kaguya's permission.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.290
Where is Mother?

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.830
She said she would be away tonight.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.880
I see, so she's gone out again.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.290
She's been away a lot lately.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.290
What do I do now?

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.330
Well now, what do you have here?

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.500
Let me take a look at your medicines.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.500
What are you doing to my products?!

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.040
These are just weeds and moldy nuts…

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.210
This one's a poisonous mushroom.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.380
If you take these, you'll get even sicker.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.750
You're just a snake oil salesman…

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.960
This village has our mother, my elder brother and me.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.250
We can cure any illness anywhere, at anytime.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.630
No one will buy stuff like this.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.670
Your power… Is it from the Divine Tree?

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.040
Just get out of here… or you'll be sorry.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.330
Damn it! How dare they belittle me!

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.210
They made me so mad, my back pain is flaring up again.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.040
The Divine Tree, huh?

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.380
If I take even just a small branch, I could sell it for a fortune…

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.170
Yes! While the devil is away… Just forget about it.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.080
Don't be foolish enough to go near the Divine Tree. You'll die.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.960
You are—!

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.170
I apologize for earlier.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.710
My younger brother is quite hot-tempered.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.540
What do you want?!

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.380
Oww!

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.330
I want to ask you something.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.960
Are you joking?!

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.670
You're not getting anything out of me!

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.460
If you answer me, I'll heal your back.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.250
Like doing that will cure anything.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.670
If it's that simple, no one would go through…

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.290
What? The pain's gone?!

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.250
Hey! You really did fix my back!

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.250
So, will you answer my questions?

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.750
Yes! Anything!

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.630
You've traveled to many different places, correct?

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.040
Oh, yes. That's how I make my living.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.250
Have you ever seen what's beyond that peak?

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.210
No, I haven't. But I've seen many other lands…

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.380
What do they say about my mother in other lands?

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.330
Well, that's…um…

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.540
Tell me even if it's something negative.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.290
Okay.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.130
There are rumors about people rebelling here and there,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.080
over Lady Kaguya's Ritual of the Divine Tree.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.250
And in order to suppress them,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.210
Lady Kaguya has annihilated the instigators.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.080
Lately, rumors are swirling that Lady Kaguya is just a tyrant…

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.290
"Annihilated"?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.460
No wonder Mother has been away a lot…

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.830
Leave, and never return. It's for your own good.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.920
Yes, sir!

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.790
Everything is going well.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.540
Elder Brother?

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.290
Hmm? Oh good, no news is good news.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.000
Elder Brother, are you still thinking about what that toad said?

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.130
No… It's not about that, but…

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.460
They're part of the Ritual of the Divine Tree…

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.250
No way!

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.380
Elder Brother!

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.290
Haori!

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.710
Hagoromo… Hamura… What's going on?

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.330
I've received notice to serve the Divine Tree.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.500
But—!

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.420
I have no choice.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.330
This is a ceremony that Lady Kaguya established eons ago…

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.830
Hagoromo, Hamura…

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.330
It was only for a short time, but I'm glad I got to meet you two.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.540
Please remember me.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.130
Haori!

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.420
Mother…

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.790
Please end the Ritual of the Divine Tree.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.580
That is not possible.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
But—!

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.170
I will not tolerate any defiance, even if you are my sons.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.790
Then please tell me…

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.580
What happens to those who go to the Divine Tree as part of this ritual?

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.290
Why does no one ever return?

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.130
This ritual is necessary… until the others arrive.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.500
"The others"?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.880
You don't need to know about them just yet.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.250
Hagoromo, Hamura… I am leaving once more.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.250
Take care of things in my absence.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.210
Yes.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.710
Elder Brother… You're not thinking of…

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.290
Yes, I intend to climb that peak.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.210
If Mother finds out, you'll get into a great deal of trouble.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.630
I'm prepared for the consequences.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.380
Okay, Elder Brother. I'm coming with you.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.420
What is this?!

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.380
Elder Brother!

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.790
Hamura!

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.130
What's wrong?

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.380
Elder Brother! Can you deal with this cocoon?

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.170
Haori!

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.460
Haori! Wake up, Haori!

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.710
Elder Brother…

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.500
It's no use…

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.290
She's dead.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.040
So this is…the truth behind the Ritual of the Divine Tree.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.630
Elder Brother! Your eyes!

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.380
Come out, Gamamaru!

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.380
It seems like you went beyond that peak…

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.460
Come with me.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.330
Where are we?

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.040
This is the Land of Toads.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.580
What is this…strange power I feel?

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.960
Oh… I'm impressed that a human can feel the power here.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.290
The natural power known as Sage Power flows freely here.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.250
And so, if you use this power…

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.250
Even I can do something like this.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.580
Wow…

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.580
Follow me!

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.830
This is known as the Memory Stone.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.380
"Memory Stone"?

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.250
Everything that occurs aboveground is recorded in this stone…

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.500
Look at what happened in the past…

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.170
Long ago, that tree fell from the sky…

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:05.290
And, as if in pursuit, your mother Kaguya appeared here.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.500
And when your mother arrived,

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.040
she fell in love with the emperor of this land

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.290
and she became pregnant with you.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.250
However,

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.080
Kaguya's destiny with humans was to be trifled by them

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.750
and in the end, she became their enemy.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.290
Kaguya acquired the power of the Divine Tree,

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.500
and your father, along with his people,

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.790
were sacrificed to it.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.460
But, to make sure mankind didn't perish,

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.500
she revived some of the humans,

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.710
erased their memories and put them back.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.580
Only Kaguya knows the truth.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.290
Where is Mother from anyway?

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.290
Why does she protect the Divine Tree?

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.790
I don't know.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:49.000
Perhaps it's related to the fact that she appeared from far up in the sky.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.670
One thing is clear…

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.330
Since the Divine Tree took root,

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.540
the Nature Energy of this land is being depleted.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.130
How could that happen?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.250
Not just from the land… but from humans too.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.750
As long as that Divine Tree exists…

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:12.250
this great land will wither, and we will suffer the same fate.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.250
We must speak with mother.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.670
Will she even listen to us?

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.330
Hagoromo, your mother's power is immense.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.290
I doubt that you can confront her directly.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.330
Even if you are her son.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.210
Gamamaru, will you teach me how to use Sage Power?

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.330
Elder Brother!

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.460
You're not planning to fight Mother, are you?!

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.880
It's just in case…

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.790
I see…

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.250
If you, who inherited Kaguya's power, acquire Sage Power…

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.000
you could definitely take her on.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.040
– However… – What is it?

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.920
Teaching you Sage Power is very risky.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.460
Why is that?

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.040
Is there any guarantee that after acquiring Sage Power,

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.630
you won't become the same as your mother?

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.250
Gamamaru… After coming this far, have you become scared?

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.420
What did you say?

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.330
You're contradicting yourself.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.170
Why did you lie in wait for us, then?

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:24.710
You planned to pit us against Mother and make us fight from the very start.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.210
You're pretty shrewd for a human, aren't you?

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.040
Yes, I had a revelation.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.040
Revelation?

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:37.000
Yes, a dream. Toads rarely, if ever, dream.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.000
But that dream was more like a prophecy…

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.330
I dreamed of you battling Kaguya.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.330
How did it end?

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.540
I don't think his dream went that far.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.540
If it did, he wouldn't be so nervous.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.710
Wha—?! How can you see so far into a toad's heart so clearly…

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.250
Just who are you?

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.170
Clear your mind…

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.960
Just feel the Nature Energy and take it into yourself.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.500
He's a surprise…

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.040
Hagoromo's acquired Sage Power in no time at all.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.170
Mother! You're back so soon…

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.210
Where is Hagoromo?

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.080
Elder Brother is still out patrolling the village…

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.420
Hamura!

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.380
Hiding things from me is useless.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:04.040
It's useless…even if you try to repel me with your Byakugan…

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.790
My Byakugan is far more superior to yours.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.150
You two broke the law, and went to the peak, didn't you?

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.400
Hiding things from me is useless.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.440
I can read your thoughts and feelings.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.730
Then why?

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.690
You must know why we're angry with you, Mother.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.360
It seems that you were in love with that young girl…

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.730
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "A Fabricated Past"

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.780
Mother, even you must have believed in that in the past!

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.860
A FABRICATED PAST

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.610
