WEBVTT

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.880
This time, I'll reach the other side for sure.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.080
Just aim it a little higher than you'd expect.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.660
That's the trick.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.910
I don't need you to tell me that.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.080
It will reach the other side if I put my all into it!

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.140
Who the hell are you anyway?

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.680
Right now, I'm just your rival at stone skipping.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.390
Though mine has already reached the other side.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.140
That was the first time I encountered Madara Uchiha.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.850
Hashirama and Madara I asked you who you are!

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.600
It's Hashirama.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.680
I can't tell you my last name due to reasons...

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.810
Hashirama, eh?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.930
Well, just watch. I'm gonna make it this time.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.520
The way he throws… I'm sure… It's the shuriken jutsu!

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.060
Hey! You stood behind me on purpose to distract me!

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.140
I'm the type that can't even pee when someone's standing behind me!

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.100
S-Sorry!

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.180
Hey… Don't take it so seriously…

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.310
Sorry, I was just making excuses… I…I didn't know…

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.270
That you had such an obnoxious self-diagnosed neurosis...

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.560
I can't tell if you're a nice guy or a nasty guy!

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.310
One thing for sure! I'm better than you at stone skipping!

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.060
Want me to skip you instead?

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.520
S-Sorry… I didn't mean to upset you.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.310
To make amends, I'll let you throw me into the river.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.100
Go ahead, throw me.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.140
Do you even notice your own obnoxious neurosis?

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.560
I just...hope I reach the opposite shore...

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.140
You're a real eyesore! Get lost!

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.020
Well then... Wait a second!

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.310
Which is it? Why don't you be more clear?

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.270
Th-That's…

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.930
That's…!

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.810
Are you…a shinobi?

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.180
This location will become a battlefield soon. Go home.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.730
This is a Hagoromo Clan crest…

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.390
Sorry, but I've got to go…

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.770
So long…

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.140
Uh…

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.890
It's Madara.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.180
Madara…

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.100
Not proffering one's family name to a stranger...

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.680
is shinobi law.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.020
I knew it… You're a shinobi too.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.060
Our personalities differed,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.930
and yet I sensed a mysterious kinship with him.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.230
I felt I knew why he'd come down to the river too.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.100
Kawarama...

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.140
Shinobi do not cry!

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.640
Shinobi are born into this world to fight and die in battle.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.100
Be grateful that we have even a piece of his corpse!

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.270
For our enemy this time includes

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.140
the Uchiha Clan in addition to the Hagoromo Clan!

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.770
They are particularly merciless!

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.230
Kawarama was just seven years old!

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.140
How long…will this kind of fighting continue?!

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.060
Until the very last foe has been vanquished.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.230
The path to a battle-free world is not easily made!

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.060
And children must be sacrificed?

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.140
I will not allow Kawarama to be disrespected!

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.310
He fought and died as a full-fledged shinobi!

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.860
He was not a child!

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.980
Older brother Hashirama, are you okay?

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.270
You know what happens when we defy Father.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.460
I…don't want…

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.890
either of you, Itama or Tobirama…

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.600
to die in vain!

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.940
The Senju, the clan of love? As if!

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.940
A full-fledged shinobi, my butt!

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.230
All of this is just grown-ups driving kids to their deaths!

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.270
We're doing exactly the same thing as the Uchiha!

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.770
That's how we honor our opponents.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.350
Even an infant wielding a weapon is deemed an enemy.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.310
And to raise one's child to become full-fledged is a parent's love!

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.430
So in order to become full-fledged, you have to die?!

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.390
We kill and are killed so much,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.230
you can't even keep track of all the grudges!

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.180
And it's too risky to even divulge our family names!

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.890
There's something totally wrong about a ninja world like this!

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.140
Children like you are called brats!

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.060
Father… Older Brother's feeling depressed today…

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.770
So please forgive him.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.890
Hashirama, go and cool your head.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.600
Grown-ups are stupid.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.100
If they want to stop the fighting, they should make a pact…

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.430
But…what about avenging our parents and brothers…

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.350
and all our friends who were killed?

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.730
Keeping saying stuff like that and you'll end up dead too.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.350
You and the adults are both hotheaded.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.600
Sorry…

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.520
Forthcoming shinobi must suppress their emotions,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.230
create suitable rules that they then follow

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.180
and avoid extraneous conflict.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.230
Can't a true pact...

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.890
an alliance be achieved?

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.180
What's a true pact?

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.100
During the Era of Warring States,

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.980
the average life expectance of both shinobi and citizens

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.770
was around 30 years old.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.520
And the reason the average was so low was...

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.270
Itama!

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.180
The deaths of many young children.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.270
Itama!

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.270
Hey, long time no see!

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.560
Umm…

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.480
It's Hashirama.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.140
So, Hashirama… You seem awfully down.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:04.930
What happened?

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.770
What's with you!

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.230
I'm fine!

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.230
Liar… You can talk to me, you know.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.810
It's nothing… Come on, tell me.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.680
I said it's nothing.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.310
Hey, stop dragging this out! I promise I'll listen!

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.560
It's really nothing…

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.560
Nothing at all.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.640
Out with it!

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.850
What's the matter?

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.730
My little brother…died.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.680
I come to the river

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.140
because I feel like all the haziness in my heart

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.350
gets washed away as I stare at the water.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.230
So that's what happened...

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.770
Your name's Madara, right…?

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.640
I wonder if you're like me…

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.020
Do you have siblings?

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.480
I'm one of five.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.020
Well, there used to be five of us.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.210
Used to?

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.440
We're shinobi.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.780
We never know when we're going to die.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.860
If there were a way where neither side had to die...

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.780
It would be where both sides revealed their insides,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.490
and hid nothing from each other...

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.490
And poured each other drinks and drank together like brothers.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.740
But that's impossible...

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:48.200
Because one can't look deep into another's insides down to their guts.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.530
In reality, they could be as mad as hell.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.360
Isn't it possible…

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.070
to really show how you feel without showing your guts?

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.780
I don't know… But every time I come here,

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.450
I pray for some way to make it happen.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.860
I finally got it to go in the right direction.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:18.990
You're not the only one…

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.530
Me too…

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.530
It reached.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.010
In all honesty, I was shocked…

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.510
That one person understood how I felt

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.640
despite all the people that didn't.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:39.810
So there was another foolish kid, who thought as I did,

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.470
to try to change this war-torn era.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.720
Maybe shocked isn't the right word…

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.430
To me, Madara was a gift from the divine.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.680
In your case…I can tell without looking into your insides that...

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.680
What?

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.350
That your hairdo and outfit are totally lame!

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.640
Not that we thought alike in every respect...

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.890
After that, we started meeting up every now and then,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.100
still without knowing each other's family names...

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.470
We'd spar and compare our shinobi moves

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.930
or talk about the future…

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.200
Taijutsu and kumite.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.990
Nice job pulling a draw against me!

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.330
It's not a draw...

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.080
I'm still standing.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.210
Huh?

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.960
Ouch!

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.120
What were you saying? How's this not a draw?

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.540
When did you…?

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.910
I threw it the instant you blew me away.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.750
I'm not gonna be beaten that easily.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.790
But the question is,

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.620
how do we change things concretely?

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.120
We've got to have a vision for the future.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.830
The first steps are for us to not give up on our ideals

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.960
and to get a lot stronger.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.360
Weak pups barking won't change a thing.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:14.770
Right. If we master all sorts of jutsu and get stronger,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.440
the adults won't be able to ignore our words anymore.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.650
We gotta master many jutsu and cover any weaknesses.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.940
Well… I am stronger than most adults around me already.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.360
No kidding? I'm impressed.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.060
You really can't, eh…?

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.770
Stop standing behind me!

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.230
I found your weakness…

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.230
I'm gonna throw you into the exact spot I pissed in!

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.810
Take this! It's my Water Style!

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.650
Disgusting! Don't whip it around!

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.770
Each time we met, we became closer friends.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.440
Madara… I came up with an amazing jutsu!

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.480
Let's master it together!

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.560
Really? Show me.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:18.940
A Secret Taijutsu Technique,

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.360
a Super Fire Style Genjutsu Slice Giant Shuriken Two-Step Drop Jutsu!

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.730
Nope… I can't visualize it at all.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.810
I mean, which is it? Taijutsu or genjutsu?

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.020
In the first place, the name is too long!

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.980
Who can remember such a long name?

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.150
Well, let me explain it...

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480
Never mind!

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.860
Today, I'm challenging you to cliff climbing!

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.060
Quit getting depressed all the time!

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.020
That's your weakness.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.060
And your weakness is to judge too quickly…

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:56.090
I'm just psyching you out… before cliff climbing!

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.510
Huh? Hey you!

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.840
See you later!

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.710
You were just pretending, huh?!

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.340
I win…

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.210
That's to be expected… You started before me!

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.590
What a sweeping view of the forest!

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.520
Yeah, you can see really far!

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.900
I know my eyesight's just as good as yours.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.360
Want to challenge me?

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.270
What makes you say that all of a sudden?

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.690
You sound really proud of your eyes.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.730
Well sure! I have Sha…

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.360
What's the matter?

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.110
No…never mind. I guess it's not all that.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.810
What is it? You're being awful candid for once.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.020
If I were better, my siblings wouldn't be dead.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.270
I couldn't even protect them.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.650
So I shouldn't...shouldn't...

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.900
Madara…

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.440
Sorry… I brought back some memories for you too, huh.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.510
So…you don't have any more siblings?

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.090
No… I have one younger brother left.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.130
And I'll protect him, no matter what!

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.840
What about you?

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.960
I have one brother left too.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.420
And I intend to protect him too, no matter what.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.940
I've decided! Let's build our settlement here!

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.980
Huh?

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.940
And make it so kids won't have to kill each other!

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:57.650
We'll create a school where kids can train and grow up stronger!

00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.360
Assign missions that fit

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.730
an individual's abilities and strengths!

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:06.230
Have superiors who can properly assign ranks to commissions!

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.520
It will be a place where kids

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.480
don't have to be sent into harsh battlefronts.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.980
You're pretty much the only one spouting nonsense.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.020
Well then, what about you?

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.760
It doesn't sound bad at all.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.460
Then it's decided!

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.370
Yeah… If that settlement gets built here,

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.270
then I could watch over my little brother,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.610
and protect him in this place where you can see to no end!

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.670
That was where the Leaf Village would eventually stand.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.760
I made a resolution that day.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.920
To endure for the sake of my vision.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.010
We both made it.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.900
That stone… is perfect for rock skipping.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.230
Hang on to it until we meet next time!

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.060
What is it, Tobirama?

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.310
Older Brother… Come with me.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.050
Hashirama, this boy you've been meeting up with...

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.310
How did you…?

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:41.110
Father ordered me to tail you… You?

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.980
I have better sensory skills than you.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.150
You've been going out quite often lately,

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.800
so I knew something was up.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.590
I checked up on that boy.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.760
He belongs to the Uchiha Clan.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.670
He has killed adults from our clan.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.710
It seems he was born with inherent shinobi talent.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.480
So I was right…

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.730
Given your lack of surprise...

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.650
Don't tell me the two of you already

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.520
knew each other's clan names.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.150
No… I didn't know.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.190
He probably doesn't know mine either.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.730
Hashirama.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.650
Do you know what this means?

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.690
The Senju and Uchiha Clans are bitter enemies.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.150
I haven't told anyone in our clan yet…

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:42.150
If we're not careful, you could be branded a traitor.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.360
If you don't want to be accused of being an enemy spy…

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.080
after you see that boy next time, follow him.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.840
And bring back intel about the Uchiha Clan.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.710
This is a mission.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.550
If he should notice you...

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.340
kill him!

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:42.720
Maybe it just isn't possible for us to reach that pipe dream of ours.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.120
Madara...you...

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.640
It may have been brief, but it was fun.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.560
Our next meeting will likely be on the battlefield.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.310
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Era of Warring States"

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:04.810
I truly wish it wasn't so... THE ERA OF WARRING STATES

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:09.930
Tune in again!
