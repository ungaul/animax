WEBVTT

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.180
You told me... "I'm no one... I don't want to be anyone..."

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.300
Stop! Don't come into my thoughts!

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.050
But the truth is... You wanted to become the Hokage, just like me.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.430
It could have even ended up

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.550
where I was chasing after your shadow...

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.840
since I've always wanted to become the Hokage.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.300
I threw away the past and my naïve self!

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.590
Then why am I able to see this?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.050
You can't hide behind a mask.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.380
You were Kakashi Sensei's friend...

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.470
my dad's subordinate...

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.840
an Uchiha like Sasuke...

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.680
and a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf who had the same dream as me.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.970
What...

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.220
What exactly do you want with me?!

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.010
To remind you that you are Obito Uchiha.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.180
I told you, didn't I?

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.590
I swore I'd tear that mask right off your face!

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.150
Obito Uchiha

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.940
Obito Uchiha?

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.610
What meaning is there in that name...

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.770
in that existence, now?

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.480
I have merged with Ten Tails.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.980
I have transcended and attained enlightenment.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.110
I am no longer human.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.480
I will guide mankind to the next stage.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.810
I possess the same will and body as the Sage of Six Paths.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.980
I am the Second Sage of the Six Paths!

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.770
Wrong! You are Obito Uchiha!

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.770
When our chakra touched earlier, I saw your past.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.730
Our personal histories and

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.610
our dream of becoming Hokage are the same.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.900
Almost exactly alike.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.270
Neither of us knew our parents.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.020
And we both lost people precious to us.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.230
Which is why you tried to scare me

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.940
by saying solitude is my worst nightmare.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.650
In the beginning,

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.770
you too wanted to be acknowledged and praised by others!

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.310
That's why you wanted to be Hokage...

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.730
If you're the same as me, that is!

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.400
But look at you now!

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.900
You've turned all shinobi into enemies

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.860
and you go spouting some nonsense

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.610
that you're doing it for the sake of the world...

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.110
when you're only doing it for yourself!

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.900
No one...

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.770
not even those precious to you

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.650
would ever acknowledge this current dream of yours.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.020
You used to have the same dream as me.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.690
But now you've become the exact opposite of a Hokage!

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.730
It's because you're just like me that...

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.150
No, it's because of that....

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.270
That I wanted to see you despair about this world.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.770
Or...I suppose I wanted to feel again for myself,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.020
that the path I have chosen for myself is not a mistake.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.020
When I was fighting you, you made me recall my youth.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.940
That's why I started wanting to test you.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.440
To see when you, someone who's just like me,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.150
would fall to despair...

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.110
and abandon your feelings, your past.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.230
It's because we were so alike that I'm pissed off!

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.940
You're just...abandoning everything and running away!

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.230
No...

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.150
What I'm doing is no different from a Hokage's actions.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.400
In fact, I'm doing even more...

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.230
I can make peace a reality.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.110
Are you really serious?

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.810
Do you really believe that?

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.770
You know, Rin, you saving me...

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.520
is really the same as you saving the world.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.810
Hmm?

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.560
I mean...

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.560
It's because I'm gonna become the Hokage and end this war!

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.810
For me to do that,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.730
I have to stay strong and healthy in this world.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.110
You get what I'm saying?

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.440
Yeah! Though you're not making much sense...

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.020
So...how do I put it...?

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.770
If you don't stay close and keep an eye on me...

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.690
I mean...

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.520
Well...

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.810
Y-You got so close all of a sudden!

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.020
Don't scare me like that!

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.150
You just said to stay close and keep an eye on you?

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.810
Yeah, I did.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.400
So watch over me.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.770
I'm going to wear the Uchiha crest...

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.560
And definitely become the Hokage!

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.940
Okay!

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.440
Yes... That's how I feel.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.520
There's no need to voluntarily tread a steep and rugged path,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.860
not knowing what's ahead.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.310
You'll have to step over the corpses of your comrades.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.440
Anyone would choose a shortcut with a fixed outcome.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.770
Yes.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.770
The goal a Hokage should seek is world peace.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.940
What the hell are you talking about?

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:42.730
What I want to know about isn't a shortcut...

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.810
but how to navigate the steep and rugged path!

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.360
Would you still say that if the final destination...

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.690
were the same?

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.810
Who can tell in the beginning which one is the dangerous one?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.230
You never know until someone starts walking.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.400
The Hokage is someone who endures the pain

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.020
and takes the lead in front of everyone...

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.520
So a Hokage never walks over his comrades' corpses.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.440
There is no shortcut to becoming the Hokage!

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.940
And there are no ways out for the one who becomes Hokage!

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.690
Isn't that right?

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.270
Oh man, oh man, oh man!

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.270
This is the one day I can't be late!

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.940
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.270
Where should we go?

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.940
I don't know, where should we go?

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.650
Where do you want to go?

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.770
It's the entrance ceremony and you're already late...

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.560
Someone like you has no business being in the Academy.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.110
You'll never make it.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.270
It's okay.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.810
NINJA ACADEMY ENTRANCE REGISTRATION

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.900
I got this for you.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.520
F-For me?

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.900
Yes! Just submit this and you'll be able to enroll.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.360
Thank you! You're a lifesaver!

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.810
Keep pampering him and he'll never be cured of his tardiness.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.360
Shut up! Do you wanna fight?

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.770
Say that again!

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.810
What?!

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.020
It's your fault!

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.940
What did you say, Kakashi?!

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.900
A perfect score of 10!

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.810
Wow, amazing!

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.480
Hey! Are you trying to kill me?!

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.770
S-Sorry!

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480
Begin!

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.190
Stop right there!

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.150
Y-Yes!

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.560
Um...um...

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.440
What is it, Obito? I didn't call on you.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.770
That was so funny!

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.110
He's so weird!

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.150
Kakashi's taking the graduation exam?

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:15.690
Yeah!

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.150
But he's the same age as us.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.770
He's brilliant, so he's skipping a level!

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.940
He should be taking the exam just about now.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.730
Damn it!

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.440
– Wow! – Wow!

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:58.980
It's amazing!

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.900
What's with that headband?

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.860
You passed!

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.230
Congratulations!

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.610
Yeah...

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.810
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.980
As if! I'll catch up to you in no time!

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:19.980
Just you wait!

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.020
Obito...

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.310
Class is starting. Let's go.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.900
Rin...

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.060
Keep...

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.360
Keep watching over me, okay?

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.940
Huh?

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.480
I...

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.360
I'll catch up to him!

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.150
Then I'll surpass him and...

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.020
I'll become the Hokage, no matter what!

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.110
Yes. Don't worry, I'll be watching.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:20.810
All right!

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.440
I'm gonna do my best!

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.900
No good...

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.860
It's no good. Of course I totally failed...

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.730
Damn it... I still can't catch up to him...

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.610
What do...I say to Rin?

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.940
So there you are!

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.230
You just dashed out of the classroom.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.060
I-I'm sorry.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.360
I looked all over you. Here you go!

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:05.940
Don't tell me I...?

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.900
Congratulations! From today, you are a full-fledged shinobi.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.730
I did it!

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:20.770
However...!

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.980
The difficult days as a Genin are just beginning!

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.690
Y-Yes!

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.730
Hereafter, you will be part of a three-man squad.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.730
Each cell has a Jonin in command

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.110
and you will fulfill your missions as a team.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.360
Excuse me.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.860
You wanted to see me?

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.980
I want to ask you a favor.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.440
The one who just left...

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.190
Isn't he Kakashi Hatake?

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.810
Yes... The White Fang of the Hidden Leaf...

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.900
Sakumo Hatake's orphaned son.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.230
Is there an issue with him?

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.650
Kakashi Hatake is an extremely talented shinobi.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.480
However, he fusses too much about sticking to the rules

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.730
and clashes with his superiors and teammates.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.610
He may excel in technique,

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.480
but as a human he has much to learn.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.810
His father broke the rules to protect his comrades,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.020
then took his own life...

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.650
His death has cast a shadow over Kakashi.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.190
And you want to place him under my supervision...

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.110
I know what you want to say.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.400
But our village has lost many Jonin and Chunin

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.690
due to the long war.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.270
I can make an allowance only so much,

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.060
and I must send the young ones to war.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.480
I understand.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.520
Goodness! How long will you keep me waiting?!

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.360
I beg your pardon! He'll be here shortly.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.900
As usual, he's late.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.560
Don't worry. He'll be here.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.730
You're too easy on him, Rin.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.270
Sorry I'm late!

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.730
Rin?

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.770
You're late!

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.770
Damn it... It's always like this.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.810
What did you say?!

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.560
Whoa...

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.560
Okay, cut it out.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.730
Mr. Genzo is tired of waiting! Hurry and line up.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.690
All right. Look this way!

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.190
It's a commemorative photo. Look at the lens!

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.680
You just couldn't throw away the memories of my dad,

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.560
or Kakashi Sensei, or this Rin person, could you?

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.600
You tried to run away from every single thing.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.810
I bet this Rin person would say this if she were still alive...

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.390
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "I'm Always Watching"

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.510
"I'm always watching," you know.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.430
I'M ALWAYS WATCHING Tune in again!
