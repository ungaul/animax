WEBVTT

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.240
What jutsu is this anyway?!

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.990
A jutsu that pulls… A jutsu that repels…

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.580
A Summoning Jutsu…

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.240
A jutsu that absorbs ninjutsu!

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.580
You have all of Pain's jutsu!

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.700
But I'm…not familiar with this one!

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.370
Oh, right!

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.950
I just confirmed that he can absorb ninjutsu a minute ago!

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.330
Stupid me!

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.830
Nagato! What the hell is that jutsu anyway?!

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.410
Tell me!

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.740
No good!

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.330
He's completely being controlled… Jigokudo!

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.660
Hey, wait… This is…

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.620
It's the reviver Pain's jutsu!

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.660
What are you after?!

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.990
Use Ningendo to extract their soul and kill them off.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.240
Hide their bodies and souls with Jigokudo…

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.780
and bring them back to me, so that I can revive them.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.490
I can make the Jinchuriki mine without Madara finding out.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.910
Now then, what else could he do?

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.280
Damn it! So you're not gonna give me any answers, after all?!

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.990
How does that reviving jutsu work again?

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.660
This stuff… It's like my soul's coming out!

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.530
And I'm losing strength…

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.450
I'm getting a bad feeling about this!

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.140
The Acknowledged One

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.380
Shurado!

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.930
What did he summon? A fancy armor?

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.180
Octopops!

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.050
He sure uses a lot of hands. To change tactics and his stance.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.430
Naruto, remember when you had that tug-of-war with the Nine Tails!

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.340
Susano'o!

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.220
Itachi!

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.590
So this is the Susano'o! Man, what a show!

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.220
You're a lifesaver! Thanks, Itachi!

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.010
What kind of ninja is he?!

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.680
Damn, he's strong! Fool, ya fool!

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.930
He's known as Pain,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.880
and has the strength of the Sage of Six Paths.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.380
So, of course he's strong!

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.180
And this time, we're facing him, not his corpse puppets!

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.010
So his power and moves are in a different league.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.800
Oh yeah…

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.680
We can still use that planet jutsu to capture them…

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.430
Planetary Devastation.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.840
Here it comes!

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.840
What is that?!

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.260
That black sphere looks like it has enormous gravitational pull!

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.470
He got me with this jutsu once!

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.760
It's super bad, it's super bad!

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.680
If you get caught in it, it's over!

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.970
Hey, Naruto… What?!

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.010
If it's a sure death, how come you're still alive?

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.430
Well then, no need to worry, about our victory.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.470
This is no time to be laughing!

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.260
How can you be so easygoing when we're in a bind like this?!

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.930
If we're caught, we'll never be able to get out!

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.800
Its gravitational power is awesome!

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.550
I got out only because of Nine Tails' rampage…

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.930
It's not about being easygoing.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.550
Analysis requires calm.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.970
It's safe to assume that the mass that Nagato threw earlier

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.840
is the central core of gravity.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.970
We need to destroy it.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.800
We'll attack the center simultaneously,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.430
each of us using our most powerful long-distance ninjutsu!

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.010
We can't aim properly under these conditions!

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.220
Our jutsu will make contact, even if we don't aim correctly.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.930
This tactic takes advantage of the core's powerful gravitational pull.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.380
Every jutsu has a weakness!

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.010
Okay.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.470
That was fast!

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.090
All right… Me too!

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.800
Yasaka Beads!

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.180
Tailed Beast Bomb!

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.930
Wind Style, Rasen Shuriken!

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.130
Forgive me…Itachi.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.340
You're back.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.550
This is the Totsuka Blade…

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:27.010
Do you think an attack like this is going to stop me?

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:31.930
This sword… This is the Totsuka Blade!

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.260
Itachi, you had this hidden with you all along!

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.680
What is that sword?

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:45.340
It's the Totsuka Blade. Also known as the Sakegari Blade.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:52.430
It seals away all it pierces, into a world of eternal genjutsu.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.840
The blade itself is imbued with a sealing jutsu

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.840
and is a variant of the Kusanagi Blade.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.050
It's a sword that possesses a sealing jutsu.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.880
You will be sealed away soon.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.880
Do you have any last words?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:22.840
Naruto, I will return to our master's side and watch your story unfold.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.930
If you ask me, you are the final volume of the trilogy.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.840
Jiraiya was the perfect first volume.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:42.590
But the second volume was a failure…me.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.340
One that our master would not acknowledge.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:02.630
The series will culminate with the third and final volume.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.720
You must make it a masterpiece…

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.880
One that will completely overshadow the failure of the middle volume, Naruto!

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.800
Farewell.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:26.260
Damn Nagato… He wasn't mobile enough!

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.760
I hoped to compensate his lack of mobility with the summoned Rinnegan,

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.550
which would give him the same field of vision.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.800
But Itachi was able to target it with his kunai even from his blind spots.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.300
That's his shuriken jutsu.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.430
Even Nagato couldn't dodge it.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.010
I have no choice, but to bring out my special reserve!

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.930
This Reanimation Jutsu or whatever they call it stinks!

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.300
Guys are forced to fight, even when they don't want to.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.840
This is happening at other battlegrounds too, right?

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.260
I will put a stop to the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.840
I leave Madara to you two.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.970
We fought with a Reanimated Ninja on the way here.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.970
The Sand shinobi sealed him…

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.880
But it seems he can't be killed, okay?

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.880
This is a perfect jutsu that has no weaknesses, okay?

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.050
I told you earlier.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.090
There is a weakness in every jutsu.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.880
I wonder about that…

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.720
No, I'll stop him!

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.970
Like I said… Leave the rest to me!

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.840
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.800
You've used Nine Tails Chakra Mode too much.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.550
No more clones right now, Naruto!

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.180
Don't try to do everything yourself.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.800
I am the best one to put an end to the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.760
I also have an idea.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:24.180
I'll put an end to this war… It's my responsibility!

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.590
I'll admit that you're stronger than before.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.260
But because of that,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.800
you seem to have lost sight of what's truly important.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.010
Now listen carefully.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.340
The people of the village, who once abhorred you,

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.800
have begun to admire you.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.300
They think of you as a comrade.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:58.800
It's because you fought hard for their acceptance.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.800
You once said it was everyone who cares about you

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.760
who helped you get where you are now.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.760
If you forget others because you now have power,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.470
and become arrogant and egotistical,

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.220
you'll eventually become just like Madara.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.800
No matter how powerful you become,

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.840
do not try to shoulder everything alone.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.840
If you do, you will surely fail.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:43.590
Your father, Minato, was able to fulfill his duty as the Hokage

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.260
because he had your mother, Kushina, and his comrades at his side.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.220
You share your father's dream, don't you?

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:56.800
Then don't ever forget…

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.970
Becoming the Hokage doesn't mean people will acknowledge you.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.380
But when the people acknowledge you,

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:05.800
you can become the Hokage.

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:08.930
Never forget your friends!

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:43.930
Naruto…

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.430
I swore to that Iruka fella. Simply put, that I'd protect ya.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.970
I won't let you go alone, bro! Cuz' I'm still alive, and rarin' to go.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.050
Don't act like a spoiled brat!

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.130
To me, you are…

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.970
To me, you are…

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.510
An important student.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.550
And…I think of you as my little brother.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.630
The enemy leader is targeting you with everything he's got.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.260
How can we allow you to face such danger?

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.930
And besides, there is no reason for you to shoulder that burden alone.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.090
You're right. I forgot.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.300
I thought I had to do it all alone.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.470
W-Why?!

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.880
Shisui's eye won't work for another decade or so.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.430
You won't be able to use it against Sasuke.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.840
But you possess something far greater than Shisui's eye.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.090
You have the same soul as Shisui.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.510
That is what Shisui really wanted to pass on.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.180
You don't need his eye anymore.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.800
As you are now,

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.880
you can stop Sasuke without something like this.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.300
You can stand before Sasuke now.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.260
This time, you can… No.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.380
I tried to do everything myself and I failed.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.430
This time, I will leave it to my comrades.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.930
I leave Sasuke to you.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:39.220
You're not just a powerful shinobi.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.880
Killer Bee… Take care of Naruto.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.880
For sure!

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.510
Itachi!

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.630
Let's go, Octopops!

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.340
Hey! Don't underestimate my jutsu!

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.800
You really should stand back!

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.840
Here are my weaknesses! For real!

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:51.800
I'm a Shadow Style user, and my summoning creature is…

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.430
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Mizukage, the Giant Clam, and the Mirage"

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.220
My summoning creature is… a giant clam!

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.550
THE MIZUKAGE, THE GIANT CLAM, AND THE MIRAGE

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.760
Tune in again!
