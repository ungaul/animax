WEBVTT

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.090
This time, we're going with my strategy.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.300
Help me out.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.550
Mother… These two are quite annoying.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
Why don't you split them up…

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.590
and take them on separately?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.260
Sasuke!

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.010
Now you won't be able to seal Mother away…

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.550
First, I'll suck out all of your chakra!

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.130
Damn it!

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.280
CONNECTING THOUGHTS It's hard to believe.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.860
So both your powers and Sasuke's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.110
are necessary in order to seal away this Kaguya?

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.740
Yeah! But like I said earlier, I can't sense Sasuke at all!

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.150
The ice…is moving.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.400
Over there!

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.860
She's merged with Nature!

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.320
Naruto!

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.780
She's finally showing herself.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.280
You said you suddenly stopped sensing Sasuke?

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.280
Yeah.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.940
Then I suspect he was taken to another dimension.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.860
If I resonate my Kamui the next time she connects

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.190
and opens a portal to another Time-Space,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.150
I'm positive I can enter it.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.070
If Sasuke is there, I can bring him back to this dimension.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.110
However…

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.320
I'll need an enormous amount of chakra to do it,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.740
since it's not my own Time-Space.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.030
If my chakra runs out while I'm there, I'm done.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.650
Then I'll go with you.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.150
The real me won't go down that quickly.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.440
Because I'm strong.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.150
Your Clone Chakra isn't enough.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.610
Would it still be inadequate with my 100 Healings Chakra?

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.240
That would give me the bare minimum.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.740
Both of you, come with me.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.820
All right!

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.190
I'm not going to waste time on a speech,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.110
because I'm almost out of time.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.320
But…

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.360
I just ask that you let me walk in front of you…

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.030
and die for you.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.820
Then it's true.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.320
This man can't be saved.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.320
That's why he intends to die…

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.120
We don't even know if Sasuke is in that Time-Space.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.160
But we'll start by getting into close range with her.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.970
I promise to find Sasuke, and deliver him to the real you.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.530
Obito.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.570
Thanks for rescuing me…

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.280
And Sasuke too.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.070
Don't thank someone like me.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.870
Just keep an eye on the enemy.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.120
So no more masks, huh?

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.070
I'm Kakashi's friend,

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.780
your father's subordinate,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.370
I'm an Uchiha just like Sasuke,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.950
and…

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.240
The Hokage is someone who endures pain

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.030
and takes the lead in front of everyone.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.280
The way he forges ahead draws others towards him.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.030
He makes you want to reach out when he's about to stumble.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.120
I was your senior who dreamt the same dream as you.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.990
Naruto!

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.870
And you said your name was Sakura?

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.200
Keep a hand on me,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.370
so we can teleport to a different Time-Space at any moment.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.570
Got it.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.120
She knows about us, after all.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.570
We have to keep in mind

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.320
that even if we jump into her dimension with Kamui,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.200
she'll perceive us.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.120
So we're not worth her attention, eh?

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.280
Yeah, come over here.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.160
What you want… is my chakra, right?!

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.240
Whatever jutsu I use, she's just going to absorb it.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.280
So what will work best on her is also…

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.990
a feint and taijutsu!

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.120
I can't use a pervy move to distract her anymore.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.070
So I gotta go back to the basics and corner her!

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.120
If she tries to escape through that weird window again,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.990
I'll enter it with her.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.490
That's where I'll look for Sasuke!

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.780
Even now, I can sense Sasuke's chakra clearly!

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.740
This is my Time-Space.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.280
You are powerless here.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.490
Are you ready, Naruto?

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.490
Yeah!

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.030
I'm going to boost your chakra to the boiling point!

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.490
Vapor Style: Unrivalled Strength!

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.410
All right!

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.780
A-Amazing…

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.740
I infused chakra for you, Naruto!

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.160
Thank you, Kurama!

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.030
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.070
Right now, this place is my Time-Space!

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.570
U...

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.990
zu...

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.120
ma...

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.990
ki!

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.030
Naruto

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.570
Uzumaki

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.070
Barrage!

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.160
It opened!

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.070
The real me will go!

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.200
He forced his way in?

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.450
Impossible!

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.910
He disappeared?

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.910
Looks like several managed to get in.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.740
The other two ran out of power and faded.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.740
Seems your clones didn't have enough chakra.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.120
Are you the original Naruto?

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.490
So what if I am?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.370
Mother, he's made it all the way into this Root Time-Space.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.240
It's not good that he's here in this place

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.660
that connects directly to the other five Time-Spaces.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.910
He might be able to get to where Sasuke is,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.570
using the resonance of the dual opposite powers.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.990
Take that weird jutsu earlier,

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.620
this shinobi Naruto has always been unpredictable.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.990
We ought to just… kill him right now!

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.160
We can't do that.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.990
I must absorb those children's chakra.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.070
You use a huge amount of chakra

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.410
whenever you change the Time-Space of the world, Mother.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.910
You need to preserve the chakra you've got for an emergency.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.120
It's better if you don't keep engaging him.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.740
If you get sealed away, all will be for naught.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.120
No doubt, you'll lose a lot of chakra.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.530
But you don't need his!

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.200
It's better than having our long- cherished plans turn to dust.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.160
You're right.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.280
We can kill him with this!

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.950
Murderous Bone Ash!

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.070
Die!

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.160
Now all of his clones in the Ice World

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.030
should be gone as well!

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.570
Thanks to Naruto,

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.280
we were able to successfully hide inside my Time-Space.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.410
But he's gone, even as a clone.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.120
You're the only one I can rely on, Sakura.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.120
I know!

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.700
There's a reason I put myself at the front!

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.120
And I'll do even more than Naruto!

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.120
He's the fool who fell in love with me…

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.070
I'm the one who made Naruto suffer the most.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.070
I was always wrong, I always made mistakes.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.990
I don't want to be wrong ever again.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.030
I don't want to make a mistake ever again.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.950
That's why… I'll never retreat!

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:37.030
Leave it to me, Sakura!

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.030
I'm the super elite ninja, and future Hokage, Naruto Uzumaki!

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.030
Remember my name!

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.870
I'm going to become Hokage

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.070
and surpass everyone who came before me!

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.450
Your previously ridiculous dreams no longer seem silly.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.660
I won't let you die!

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.280
I simply won't let you!

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.490
You're not going to die, no matter what!

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.480
Looks like we succeeded in getting in, Obito.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.350
Now that you've teleported over there,

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.810
please don't get crushed on the other side!

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.730
We killed the original!

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.350
So why aren't they gone?

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.230
The real me will go!

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.560
Damn it!

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.100
Are you okay, Naruto?

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.770
How is this okay?!

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.680
Never mind. Just be ready when Kaguya comes back.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.680
The Kamui worked.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:27.930
They're onto us!

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.430
I'll draw their attention,

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.180
so you two go hide in the meantime!

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.480
I've marked this spot,

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.430
so I can hide in my Time-Space for the time being.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.310
You too, Sakura!

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.680
The other two ran out of power and faded.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.680
Seems your clones didn't have enough chakra.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.390
Are you the original Naruto?

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.730
So what if I am?!

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.520
So they were just clones back there.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.390
You fooled us.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.230
You got me.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.310
I'm… the original.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.140
I've gotta fight smart and keep them busy

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.980
so they don't go back over there.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.770
This Time-Space should be connected to the others.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.810
We'll open them one by one and look for Sasuke.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:37.930
Right!

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.350
I'll give him all the chakra I've got!

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.980
What an incredibly vast Time-Space…

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.020
To be able to connect them in an instant.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.100
Just who is this Kaguya?!

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.060
Isn't that where we were before?

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.520
I can't sense Sasuke in there!

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.350
Are you all right?

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.560
On to the next!

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.430
Yes!

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.810
I thought it was around here…

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.730
What is…that?

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.480
He's not here either.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.020
You should rest a bit.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.350
What about chakra?

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:19.480
Oh… I still have reserves.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.480
Keep enough to get back.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.270
If worse comes to worst and we can't find Sasuke…

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.520
We'll find him!

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.180
Next!

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.770
Be careful about making a gateway, Mother.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.350
Naruto will get closer to Sasuke.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.350
Plus, I've figured out something.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.060
The original Naruto has Truthseeker Orbs around him!

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.100
A sea of acid!

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.430
Are you okay?

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.770
I'm fine!

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.310
This is nothing.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.310
You are a Medical Ninja, aren't you?

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.060
I'll wait until you heal your wound.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.810
That place wasn't the right one either.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.640
After we rest a little, we'll… Don't worry about it!

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.430
There's a limit to our chakra, right?

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.100
Why don't you tend to your wound?

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.560
Just a little will…

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.600
I don't want to waste this chance that Naruto gave us!

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.890
You want to help him if he starts to stumble, eh?

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.180
Huh?

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.520
It's nothing.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.430
Okay, next!

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.520
Yes!

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.520
He's here!

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.680
Sasuke!

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.390
Sasuke!

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.020
Over here! Hurry!

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.430
Damn it!

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.350
Sasuke!

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.190
Cha!

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.680
Sasuke!

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.430
No way…

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.230
How did you do it?

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.020
It's one of my abilities.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.430
I can shift myself between spaces,

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.480
although only over a finite distance.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.100
But I made it here, thanks to that.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:52.070
Am I powerless to do anything but watch?

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.740
Right about now, Sakura and Obito are battling…

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.740
I really couldn't do much for you as your teacher.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:04.740
Nor Obito and Rin, as your friend.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.820
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: “The Two of Them…Always”

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.530
I just put on airs… and kept making mistakes.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:21.070
THE TWO OF THEM…ALWAYS Tune in again!
