00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.170
Naruto…

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.290
Just disappear already…

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.630
and take our bond along with you!

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.500
Sasuke wins!

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.540
All right, you two… make the Unison Sign.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.250
You wanna piece of me, you loser?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.710
What is this?

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.170
Sasuke…

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.000
If you and I fight…

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.290
We'll both...

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.420
die.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.700
Am I dead?

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.120
This sensation…

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.660
It must be…

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.080
Probably.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.290
Pitiful, isn't it?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.290
You had the Nine Tails…

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.830
and I was an Uchiha.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.490
We were ostracized from the village and treated like outcasts.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.910
And we resented the village and its people.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.910
Right?

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.290
I won't let you say I'm wrong.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.870
You called me your brother… In that sense, perhaps we were.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.410
You're totally wrong!

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.120
Damn it, you don't understand, do you?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.790
Sorry, Grandma Tsunade…

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.160
I promised…I wouldn't die…

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.370
until I became the Hokage…

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.580
Oh yeah! The Infinite Tsukuyomi!

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.370
This is bad!

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.120
The Release Jutsu can't be activated without us being there, right?!

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.080
You're dead…and you're worried about what happens to the world?

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.580
Of course!

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.410
We can't leave it like that!

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.870
Sakura and Kakashi still remain.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.870
They'll figure something out.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.910
I hope so.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.040
Naruto!

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.160
The Hokage, huh…

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.330
Pretty soon, Big Brother, they might carve your Great Stone Face over there!

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.120
Big Brother?

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.610
Forgive me, Sasuke. This is it.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.990
And no matter what you do from here on out, know this…

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.790
I will love you always.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.910
Big Brother…

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.330
I'll be seeing you…soon.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.140
You've finally come to, eh?

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.930
As you can see…

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.970
if either of us moves too much, we'll bleed out and die.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.100
Why would you go that far?

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.220
Why do all that…

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.140
just to get in my way?

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.430
I gained the power to enter the darkness, and sever all bonds…

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.060
And naturally, everyone's tried to cut their ties to me as well, at some point.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.220
But you…

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.020
You've never attempted to cut me off.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.930
The only one who can handle all that hatred is me!

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.930
Why do you keep involving yourself with me?

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.270
You already know, don't you?

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.930
Now that your body can't move, your mouth sure is moving a lot.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.430
Just answer me!

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.310
'Cuz you're my friend.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.520
What is it with you anyway?

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.680
I'm your friend!

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.720
Just what the hell do you want? Why are you so fixated on me?

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.390
It's because I'm your friend!

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.600
I've heard that before.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.640
But what exactly does that mean to you anyway?

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.100
You ask me to explain it, but I really can't put it into words.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.600
It's just that…

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.180
when I see you take on stuff… and get all messed up…

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.180
It kinda…

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.890
hurts me.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.970
It hurts so much inside,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.970
that I can't just leave it alone, y'know?

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.390
Though right now, I'm in a lot of pain all over, and I can't do anything about it.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:02.680
Naruto… I knew you were always alone back then.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.600
The village shunned you, just like they did with me…

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.890
the lone Uchiha survivor.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.520
You intentionally did stupid things to get scolded,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.970
most likely to get people's attention.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.180
In the beginning, I thought you were good for nothing.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.930
A weakling who just constantly wanted to goof around.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.060
But the more I watched you being idiotic and getting scolded over and over…

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.810
For some reason, it started weighing on my mind.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:38.390
I thought back then, that your weakness was gradually rubbing off on me.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.470
Then, every time I'd see you, I'd think about you more and more.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.180
Seeing you desperately trying to bond with others…

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.720
made me remember my own family.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.270
And I don't know why, but I felt relief.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.770
But at the same time, I considered it a weakness.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.970
I trained hard as if to escape that weakness.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.890
In order to get my revenge on my brother

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.140
to become stronger than him.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.390
And yet… I ended up on the same team as you.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.390
And I began thinking about my family again.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.220
I went on missions with you

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.890
as you jabbered on and on about becoming Hokage…

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.930
I saw how both of us were getting stronger…

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:31.270
And one day, I started to feel the desire to fight you too.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.810
And I began to see a shadow of my own family in Squad 7…

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.180
That's why every time I saw you suffering…

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.470
That's right… I felt it…

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.430
I felt pain too.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.640
When I understood your hurt, I finally saw you as a comrade.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.600
But on the other hand…

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.600
I couldn't leave you alone. You were getting stronger and stronger.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.060
Watching you steadily get stronger…

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.850
I…

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.060
I knew that you were always alone.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.810
I wanted to walk over and start talking.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.470
I'd get sort of giddy.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.560
But I stopped myself.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.720
I was jealous because you were good at everything.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.060
So I made you my rival.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.100
You've been…

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.390
my goal.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.020
I had nothing, and I found a bond.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.100
I wanted to be strong and cool like you.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.270
That's why I kept chasing after you.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.850
It was the opposite.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.430
In reality, I was the one who was jealous of you.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.930
Because you had a strength that I didn't.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.520
You were always walking in front of me.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.520
Just like my late Big Brother.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.720
And…even today…

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.180
I'll let you deal with Sasuke.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.890
That was my plan from the start!

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.270
Entrusting it to you was the right thing to do, after all.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.720
These are—!

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.220
Naruto's memories.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.390
My dream… is to surpass the Hokage one day!

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.180
And that's why I'm going to

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.350
make everyone in the village acknowledge me!

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.390
I have to be ready…

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:41.020
I'm gonna be called the Hokage, someone that everyone acknowledges.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.520
There's no such thing as a shortcut!

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.390
Quit messin' around, I'll never run away!

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.720
I will make it!

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.100
Even if I stay a genin for the rest of my life,

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.970
I'll become the Hokage. So I don't care!

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.810
I never go back on my word. That's my Ninja Way!

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.100
I'm different from you.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.060
I'm absolutely gonna become the Hokage.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.100
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:21.310
I won't die… until I become the Hokage!

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.020
I'm gonna become the Hokage to surpass all the previous ones!

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.060
That's my dream, you idiot!

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.310
The Hokage is someone who endures the pain

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.140
and takes the lead in front of everyone.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.720
So a Hokage never walks over his comrades' corpses.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.180
There is no shortcut to becoming the Hokage!

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.020
And there are no ways out for the one who becomes Hokage!

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:51.930
No way can a guy who can't even save one friend become the Hokage.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.350
Isn't that right, Sasuke?

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.600
Naruto...

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.390
How far…have you—?

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.770
No matter how powerful you become,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.930
don't try to shoulder everything alone.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.100
You share your father's dream, don't you?

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.100
Then don't ever forget…

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.970
Becoming Hokage doesn't mean people will acknowledge you.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.930
But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.350
Never forget your friends!

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.220
Big Brother…

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.220
I see.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.350
Then…

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.020
show me…

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.140
Where are we?

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.100
Don't tell me this is really Heaven this time?

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.020
Looks like we fell asleep and slept until morning.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.140
We've failed to die again.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.850
Damn it! I still can't move!

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.930
I was hoping to punch you hard and make you finally open your eyes!

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.100
W-What is it?

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.180
We're messed up like this, and you still wanna fight?

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.310
Damn right! No matter how many times it takes—

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.600
I admit it.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:36.270
I've…

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.680
lost.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.390
You idiot!

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.220
This fight isn't about winning or losing!

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.220
It's about punching a sulking friend, to make him snap out of it!

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.520
That's what it's about!

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.890
The real match that I want, comes after that!

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.020
Hey, Naruto…

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.930
I just acknowledged you.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.020
If I die here, the long cycle of destiny the Sage of Six Paths mentioned

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.640
will probably end as well.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.020
This is…a kind of revolution too.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.640
You can release the Infinite Tsukuyomi after I'm dead,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.220
by transplanting my left eye into Kakashi or someone else.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:32.810
I'll put an end to myself.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.390
By dying? Don't think dying will settle this!

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.720
If you're willing to die, then live and help me instead.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.720
What I want to do is to make all shinobi cooperate with each other.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.970
And that definitely includes you!

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.520
Just because you want that doesn't mean others will agree to it.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.020
Damn it! If you keep whining and sulking, I'll slug you again!

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.970
There's no guarantee I won't stand against you again…

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.640
Then I'll stop you again!

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.890
Besides, I know you're not going to do that kinda thing anymore.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.430
How can you be so sure?

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.060
Don't make me repeat myself!

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.060
Haven't you figured it out yet?!

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.180
Now that I think about it…

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.970
You were always pretty stupid too…

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:32.110
THE UNISON SIGN

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.770
Shut up, you loser.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.150
I'll start knowing your pain and feelings too, Naruto.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.440
You never cut me off.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.030
You kept trying to get closer to my feelings.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.150
You never stopping calling me your friend.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.530
Even though I tried to sever those feelings myself.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.030
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Naruto Uzumaki!"

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.900
You stopped me, as a friend.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.820
NARUTO UZUMAKI!

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:28.150
Tune in again!
