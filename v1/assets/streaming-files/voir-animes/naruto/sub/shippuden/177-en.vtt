WEBVTT

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.650
Here they come…

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.860
Mu is not moving.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.940
There's no sign of him or his chakra.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.820
Seems the Second Tsuchikage has been detected.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.940
Even though he was known as the "Null Man."

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.820
It will soon be ripe for war.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.230
The real fight is just beginning.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.480
With that class of shinobi, I anticipate bigger results

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.650
by not killing off their thoughts and emotions.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.530
I'll let him do as he pleases after the Summoning Jutsu.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.530
The Brilliant Military Advisor of the Hidden Leaf

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.530
The Second Tsuchikage…

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.030
The Third Raikage…

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.280
The Second Mizukage…

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.530
The Fourth Kazekage…

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.400
Too bad we don't have a Hokage.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.570
Still, four Kage from history are here.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.280
I'll just let the Kage and their progeny kill each other off.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.320
Where am I?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.570
My, my… What a gathering of former enemies!

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.610
Well, well. I don't know this guy.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.230
This is a foul jutsu of the Second Hokage.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.440
The dead are summoned back from the afterlife and then bound.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.440
You were summoned here by force.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.280
The dead?! What do you mean?

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.820
Have you forgotten?

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.820
I killed you myself.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.230
You died ages ago, Second Mizukage.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.440
Oh…back then… Hey wait!

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.230
You also died that day! In fact, I killed you.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.570
Was that so?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.440
Well, no matter.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.780
Let me continue… Where was I?

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.610
Where is the Second Hokage?

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.030
He's the jutsu user who resurrected us?

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.480
I detect someone several kilometers ahead.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.530
One with the same chakra as this new face…

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.320
along with a huge army.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.980
No doubt you are…

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.650
I am the Fourth Kazekage.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.440
My predecessors have told me about your exploits.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.070
So this means the Sand has continued

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.900
through to the fourth, no, the fifth generation.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.480
It feels strange being in the future.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.860
Listen, this is not the future.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
We're just beings from the past.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.570
And don't interrupt me, or I'll kill you.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.570
But I was killed. And I killed you!

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.440
I was just telling you the story

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.530
of the Second Hokage who resurrected us…

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.360
The Second Hokage was long dead by my time.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.610
But there was a shinobi capable of using the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.860
A shinobi named Orochimaru.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.780
Four…and among them…

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.900
is Father.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.610
That's all.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.730
It's a message from Headquarters.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.440
Our Commando Unit has skirmished with the enemy's Commando Unit.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.070
Our predictions about the enemy were correct.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.480
But they are raising the dead with a jutsu

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.780
known as the Reanimation Jutsu and sending them onto the battlefield.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.530
Who knows what kind of shinobi we'll see on the battlefield.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.610
So everyone, be prepared.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.480
That's the signal.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.150
The enemy is near.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.650
But there's no word from Headquarters

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.190
that they detected the enemy.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.570
What's going on?

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.480
It probably means there are guys

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.150
that even Headquarters cannot sense.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.940
After all, the enemy will only revive the strong ones.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.110
We have to fight dead people?

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.730
What do I do? I'm getting scared.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.440
Hey Choji, now that you're here it's too late to whine.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.980
U-Uh-huh…

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.900
We just received word from Captain Gaara's Fourth Company.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.530
Four of the enemies have been spotted.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.820
They are the Second Mizukage, the Second Tsuchikage,

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.150
the Fourth Kazekage and…

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.320
And who's the other?!

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.780
The Third Raikage.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.280
What?!

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.400
My old man too?!

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.610
Damn the Akatsuki!

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.110
The numbers don't match up with our own sensory readings.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.480
Are you sure this data is accurate?

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.480
Princess Tsunade…

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.610
It's the Second Tsuchikage that has appeared.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.480
Huh?!

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.190
It's no wonder we could sense three,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.650
but couldn't detect one.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.280
The reason sensory detection was futile is the doing of Lord Mu.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.610
There's someone who can evade detection

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.610
from even the Headquarters' Sensory Radar Jutsu?!

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.780
What is he?

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.530
Captain Ao!

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.070
There are far too many of those white monsters.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.400
It's impossible for me to detect

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.230
the ones with special characteristics.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.440
Darui's First Company will soon encounter

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.980
several thousand enemy troops!

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.150
Please distinguish the white ones

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.940
from those under the Reanimation Jutsu!

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:53.860
All right!

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.480
You take charge of the broad-range scan!

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.570
Huh?!

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.940
This is not good!

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.980
Darui's First Company will be facing too many

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.650
who are under the Reanimation Jutsu!

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.780
Furthermore, they're all powerful shinobi!

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.440
They're coming.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.900
Give the signal to get into position for battle.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.730
Right.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.480
There are so many…

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.070
It's not just their numbers.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.530
Headquarters was right.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.570
I can distinguish the adept ones with my Byakugan.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.900
Lord Hiashi! Look towards 10 o'clock.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.980
Th-That's…

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.440
N-No way. That can't be…

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.610
What's wrong?

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.440
What about them?

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.030
That's…

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.570
They're…Lords Kinkaku and Ginkaku…

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.980
What?! These two are bathed in the Nine Tails' chakra!

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.780
Incredible chakra!

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.030
There's no doubt!

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.360
They are the Gold and Silver Brothers of the Hidden Cloud.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.610
What?

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.650
Even Dan is among them?

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.320
The Fourth Company is facing my old man.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.110
And the First Company is looking at Kinkaku and Ginkaku.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.440
Now that it's come to this,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.190
I have no choice but to go out there myself.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.690
Please wait…

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.780
Lord Raikage…

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.570
You are the Supreme Commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces!

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.480
The Supreme Commander must remain safe in order to give orders

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.730
to the troops until the final stages of the war.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.400
That is your duty towards your charges.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.110
But an enemy force of enormous strength

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.110
is converging on Darui's First Company!

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.690
The tide of battle is like a living thing.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.650
It changes second by second.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.980
To discern those changes is why I am here!

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.320
Bring me the map!

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.190
First, let us verify every company's status.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.710
At the forefront is Kankuro's Commando Unit.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.420
KANKURO COMMANDO UNIT At the forefront is Kankuro's Commando Unit.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.670
REANIMATED SASORI DEIDARA UNIT KANKURO COMMANDO UNIT At the forefront is Kankuro's Commando Unit.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.670
REANIMATED SASORI DEIDARA UNIT KANKURO COMMANDO UNIT It seems they have skirmished with

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.500
REANIMATED SASORI DEIDARA UNIT KANKURO COMMANDO UNIT a Commando Unit of reanimated shinobi.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.630
However, they defeated the enemy!

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.830
Presently, they are moving forward towards the Akatsuki hideout.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.750
Among the combat battalions,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.170
Kakashi's Third Company is leading the charge.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.210
KAKASHI THIRD COMPANY

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.210
SEVEN NINJA SWORDSMEN KAKASHI THIRD COMPANY Kakashi's Third Company is leading the charge.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.000
SEVEN NINJA SWORDSMEN KAKASHI THIRD COMPANY They are in the midst of battle now,

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.580
but they have taken the advantage.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.920
Right now, the main battle is being waged here

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.380
KITSUCHI SECOND COMPANY by Kitsuchi's Second Company.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:32.880
KITSUCHI SECOND COMPANY

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.790
WHITE ZETSU UNIT KITSUCHI SECOND COMPANY

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.580
And Mifune's Fifth Company is standing by

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.290
MIFUNE FIFTH COMPANY And Mifune's Fifth Company is standing by

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.170
MIFUNE FIFTH COMPANY to assist in any battle.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.500
Now then, it begins right here.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.420
The enemy unit that came by sea.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.500
COASTLINE WHITE ZETSU UNIT Darui's First Company will take them on.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.130
COASTLINE WHITE ZETSU UNIT DARUI FIRST COMPANY Darui's First Company will take them on.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.830
Let's call this Battlefield A.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.420
And facing the previous Kage who suddenly appeared…

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.710
REANIMATED FOUR KAGE And facing the previous Kage who suddenly appeared…

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.380
GAARA FOURTH COMPANY REANIMATED FOUR KAGE is Gaara's Fourth Company.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.540
We'll call this Battlefield B.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.460
When you look at it like this,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.500
we seem to be evenly matched in strength.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.580
It's unwise to think that.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.000
The ironclad rule of warfare is to take the advantage

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.630
by mobilizing troops!

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
ENEMY                         ENEMY

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.540
The enemy advances from two directions.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.500
You counter that by attacking from one direction with full force.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.670
We are dealing with two battlefields here.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.250
A and B…

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.080
First, we must deal with A.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.420
We will concentrate our troops with Darui's First Company.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.710
So, we will deploy Mifune's Fifth Company

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.330
in belt formation as support to reinforce the ranks from the rear.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.380
Then we will move Kitsuchi's Second Company to the side

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.920
and box the enemy in from the sea.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.790
Kitsuchi's Second Company may be stretched thin.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.460
But, the Fifth Company's deployment in belt formation

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.630
will serve as a barrier.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.250
Meanwhile, Gaara's Fourth Company will break up and

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.540
make a slow retreat to the opposite side of the village

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.460
as if to lure the enemy.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.500
From there, half of the company will join up

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.500
with Darui's First Company as reinforcements.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.580
And after the enemy is crushed in Battlefield A,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.290
Darui's First Company and Gaara's squads will turn back

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.960
towards Battlefield B…

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.880
and the enemy that Gaara's Fourth Company had kept occupied

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.750
will be crushed from the rear all at once.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.080
Why start with Battlefield A?

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.830
If you split Gaara's Fourth Company into two,

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.710
won't the enemy seize that opportunity to attack?

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.630
Don't underestimate those four.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.420
They are former Kage!

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.210
With Battlefield A, Companies Two and Five are in close proximity

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.330
to Battlefield A and can move quickly.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.880
Also, Kitsuchi's Second Company has engaged the white ones before

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.420
and is familiar with them.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.460
Attacking the white clones from the rear

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.130
will ensure a high rate of success.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.670
As for the enemy in Battlefield B…

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.880
The former Kage cannot launch an attack.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.500
If the troops suddenly break off into two,

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.290
the enemy will assume we're up to something and will not charge.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:17.380
The war-savvy former Kage will not be so foolish as to attack…

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.170
I see.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.380
And even if they were to attack,

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.290
Gaara's Fourth Company is a long-range battle unit.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.960
They specialize in fighting from a distance, which means

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.210
it would take longer to engage them in a short-distance battle.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.380
In other words, it is a company that could buy us time.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.710
What will you do, Supreme Commander?

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.790
No wonder we could not take down the Leaf.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.580
You are blessed with fine shinobi, Tsunade.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.710
Save the compliments for after the war.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.420
So? What will you do?

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.080
All right! Let's do it!

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.830
Inoichi, you've been listening, right?

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.790
I'm already on it. Also…

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.170
We've already sent word to Mifune about the Commando Unit.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.630
They are on their way.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.000
And Shizune is allocating her people evenly

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.540
to provide medical attention.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.630
A unit resurrected from the Reanimation Jutsu

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.670
is part of the army.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.330
War is finally beginning.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.630
Shikaku is thinking about strategy at Headquarters.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.670
That guy is an amazingly clear thinker.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.630
He comes up with brilliant tactics that I could never dream up.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.630
Oh… And Inoichi will pass that on to us without fail.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.420
I have faith in them and we will battle right here.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.830
Yes! Have faith in our comrades.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.630
You're right.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.710
We have to hold back the enemy, for our comrades' sake.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.540
Thank you, Choza.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.580
All companies have been notified!

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:58.130
All right, it's been a while since Ino-Shika-Cho went into action!

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.170
I have one question, Nara from the Hidden Leaf.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.960
What is it?

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.500
In order for your strategy to be foolproof,

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.250
you must add in one thing.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.130
Which is?

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.250
The Second Tsuchikage is no ordinary shinobi.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.540
The only one who can stop him is the old Fence-Sitter.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.040
His name has come up often in our discussions.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.040
What kind of shinobi is he?

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.380
From the time I heard that his chakra could not be detected,

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.630
I knew he would be a problem.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.670
He is known as a Kekkei Touta shinobi…

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.920
which is a considerably higher level than the Kekkei Genkai.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.790
Kekkei Touta?!

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.880
I thought you, Third Tsuchikage, were the only one…

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.420
The Second Tsuchikage too?

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.170
The ability to activate the three chakra natures

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.170
of wind, earth and fire, all at once.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.130
He was my teacher who taught me the Particle Style.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.790
To have to battle my master at this age…

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.080
It does not pay to live a long life.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.250
Will you go?

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.540
Yes.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.670
What choice do I have?

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.580
Nara… Yes?

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:22.960
I'm not going just because Lord Mu of the Particle Style is there.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.710
Your tactical plan is brilliant.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.290
And while all the resurrected Kage

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.630
who stand before the Fourth Company know war,

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.580
they will not make unnecessary moves.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.670
You are probably right in your battle assessment.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.000
But the opposite is also possible.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.080
The one who united the Allied Forces is Gaara.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.000
His youthful passion was the primary catalyst.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.670
And you are saying

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.330
this can have the opposite effect on the battlefield?

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.880
I appreciate your insight.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.750
Well then, I guess it's time to leap into the war

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.630
and show these young brats what fighting is all about.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.630
Especially that brazen young kid.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.580
A jutsu that controls the Second Hokage's corpse…

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.040
The user doesn't seem to be the Second Hokage,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.000
but this Reanimation Jutsu…

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.420
There are times when your body won't do what you want it to.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.380
Movement is restricted.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.830
Seems that way.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.500
I thought about killing you earlier,

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.420
but my body wouldn't let me.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.460
I would have enjoyed battling you all.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.830
Such a shame, such a shame…

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.000
Gaara, eh…

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.810
I'll show them why I'm the one guarding the coastline.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.020
I'll launch the opening shot, then you all engage! Continue!

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.770
I won't let you pass!

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.310
You didn't need to get up.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.020
Who's the one who lifted me up?

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.680
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Battleground!"

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.680
BATTLEGROUND! Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Battleground!"

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.140
BATTLEGROUND! I'm going to retrieve here, what I previously forsook!

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.430
BATTLEGROUND!

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.480
Tune in again!
