00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.410
Itachi's Story – Light and Darkness: Truth

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.290
DUMPLINGS

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.950
Kakashi.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.080
It's unusual that you're here first.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.040
Well, it happens once in a while.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.990
What's going on? Why did you summon us here?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.120
Sasuke!

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.990
You've grown up…

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.620
It's been a long time, Sasuke.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.740
Itachi Uchiha!

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.830
I will…

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.490
…kill you!

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.540
Ah…the Sharingan.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.080
I see a resemblance… Just who is he?

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.040
He's my younger brother.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.990
So you've awakened your Sharingan.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.870
Otherwise…

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.990
It's just as you've said.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.950
I've hated you, and resented you.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.240
I have lived my life…

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.370
How strong have you gotten?

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.120
…for the sole purpose of killing you… Chidori?!

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.120
I see…it was Kakashi, huh?

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.120
Sasuke!

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.040
Damn it!

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.040
Ninja Art: Summoning—!

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.910
Too slow!

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.540
Master Jiraiya!

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.330
So your target is Naruto, after all?

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.370
Taking Naruto is the overriding mission we have been assigned to,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.330
by the Akatsuki.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.370
I can't let you have Naruto.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.910
I wonder about that…

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.080
Perfect timing. I will get rid of both of you right here.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.370
Don't interfere…

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.540
If anyone is going to kill him… It will be me.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.080
I have no interest in you right now.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.240
Not yet, Sasuke.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.120
Sasuke!

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.910
Damn it!

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.490
Naruto!

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.620
I said not to interfere!

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.450
This is my fight!

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.160
That's right.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.240
Fine by me!

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.660
You still don't have enough…

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.290
Forgive me, Sasuke.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.410
Forgive me!

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.120
You are merciless.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.200
Hate me…

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.330
You are weak.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.120
From now, for 24 hours… Relive that day.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.160
Using Tsukuyomi on your younger brother?

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.870
That's enough…outta…you!

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.790
You are weak, because you don't have enough hatred.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.580
C'mon, Kisame!

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.910
Wait! Why you—!

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.240
Why did we have to retreat?

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.950
You could have—!

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.540
Sasuke…

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.040
Even though Lord Third is dead,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.450
you still have people who will protect you…

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.490
I'll be waiting, Sasuke.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.120
Why are you so obsessed with my brother?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.490
He's just a Rogue Ninja.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.370
That's because, unlike you…

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.450
He's more of a brother to me than you are to him…

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.160
You've been trying to take Sasuke back to the village.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.120
But what if it doesn't go the way you want it to?

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.540
I'll do anything to bring him back!

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.080
You just said you consider Sasuke to be like a brother…

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.450
What if Sasuke were to attack the Hidden Leaf Village?

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.080
What would you do then?

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.790
What? Why would Sasuke—?

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.910
There's no way he'd do something like that!

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.080
Sasuke is still a blank canvas.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.740
He can easily be dyed into any color.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.080
In that case, would you be able to stop him?

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.290
Even if you have to kill Sasuke?

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.950
Could you weigh Sasuke against the Hidden Leaf on a set of scales?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.160
I would defend the Leaf Village!

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.160
And I would find a way to stop Sasuke without killing him!

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.450
You're such a child…

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.450
What you speak of are all fantasies.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.790
A shinobi must be capable of making very harsh decisions.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.450
Someone else tried to tell me the same thing before.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.740
But for me, there is no choice.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.700
I never go back on my word…

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.200
That's my Ninja Way.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.120
I see.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:48.910
You've come…

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.040
That Sharingan… How much can you actually see?

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:01.080
What I'm seeing right now… Is your death, Itachi.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.790
My death, huh?

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.700
Well then…

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.580
…make it happen.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.990
Forgive me, Sasuke…

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.120
This is the end.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.490
You don't ever have to forgive me.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.790
I will love you always.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.120
I…

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.830
I've made up my mind, Big Brother…

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.620
All that's left…is them.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.410
So it really didn't let the light through…

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.080
Finally…

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.160
Looks like it didn't affect that black one.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.700
Sasuke!

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.490
What do we do to release everyone from the genjutsu?!

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.040
Rinnegan genjutsu can be dealt with using Rinnegan, probably.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.290
Which means we need Sasuke's left eye.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.290
I won't let that happen.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.910
All that's left to do is to get rid of you guys…

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.660
Which I, the savior of the world will do.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.540
Madara!

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.000
That eye on his forehead!

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.460
Be careful.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.540
We're surrounded in all directions by four of his Shadows.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.340
I know that!

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.090
I won't allow you to do anything further.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.500
I just severed the Karmic Cycle of this world.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.840
I have freed humankind

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.500
from their suffering, pain and their futility.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.920
But all this…is just a lie!

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.130
Naruto, you're the one who's interfering

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.170
with everyone's happiness.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.960
Just look at this world now.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
All fighting between shinobi has ceased.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.040
I've transformed hell into heaven.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.250
I've finally corrected Hashirama's mistake.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.250
What do you mean by the First Hokage's "mistake"?

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.090
You Hidden Leaf may not want to acknowledge it,

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:16.670
but Hashirama ultimately failed in reforming the Shinobi World.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.920
In the beginning, both Hashirama and I had the same goals.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.710
And we worked together.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.710
We tried to change the shinobi world

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.250
that sent out barely grown children out to war.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.790
The two of us created the shinobi village.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.750
However, that does not result in true peace.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.880
People cannot show each other their true feelings.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.040
Fear, suspicion, and resentment… …never subside.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.420
FIRE LIGHTNING WIND EARTH WATER My opinions were pushed aside

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.000
FIRE LIGHTNING WIND EARTH WATER and the Shinobi World moved forward

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and the Shinobi World moved forward

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.340
in accordance with Hashirama's vision.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.090
And what happened because of it?

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.880
The fighting between shinobi hasn't stopped.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.960
Rather than ceasing, establishing ninja villages led to

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.380
an increase in their military build-up,

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.840
which resulted in battles that turned into great wars…

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.130
with countless lives lost.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.420
The battling in what became the First Great Ninja War…

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.750
The Second Great Ninja War…

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.710
The Third Great Ninja War…

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.250
The fighting never stopped.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.750
That is Hashirama's legacy to the Shinobi World.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:42.960
Although I admit that I triggered this Fourth Great Ninja War…

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.210
That's right! Because of you, so many people died!

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.960
I did make a proposition

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.210
to peacefully hand over the Tailed Beasts.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.540
Right now, everyone is inside the Divine Tree.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.250
Each one of them, dreaming their own idyllic dreams.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.040
They are in their own ideal worlds.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.500
Is this your idea of a perfect world?

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.170
You're just deceiving people.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.090
I just want to be the savior

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.380
that ends the long history of fighting amongst shinobi.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.880
Just know this… It's all over.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.540
You're wrong, Madara.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.380
You are not the savior… Nor is this the end of things…

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.290
I can't…move…

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.790
What's going on?

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.920
How can you say that you, unlike Obito,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.340
are able to completely take advantage of others?

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:56.130
Isn't that presumptuous to think that you alone are different?

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.920
My dear Madara…

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:02.460
You have also been inside a phantom dream…

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.880
Inside a dream that I concocted.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.210
Black Zetsu… What are you saying?

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.590
I created you.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.170
You are my will incarnate!

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:25.880
Wrong again… My will is… Kaguya's!

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.130
What the hell is going on?

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.250
They're having a falling out, at this stage in the game?

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.340
No, that's not it.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.290
He just mentioned Kaguya.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.790
Huh? Kaguya?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.090
What is that?

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.420
The one the Sage of the Six Paths mentioned.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.340
The current Madara is a prime example of that…

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.630
He's become just like my mother, Kaguya.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.250
He's obtained Ten Tails' power and is getting close to me…

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.380
and is trying to attain even my mother Kaguya's power.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.880
In time, my mother's power eventually gave rise to hubris…

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.840
And the populace came to fear the existence of that power.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.340
No way…

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.460
What is it?!

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.290
Is their chakra being absorbed?

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.420
What's up with this guy?

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.170
This chakra is ridiculous!

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.500
All of Madara's shadows that were surrounding us have disappeared!

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.290
Something's about to happen!

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.040
It's chakra!

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.920
Is he absorbing all the chakra that's erupting from the ground?

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.090
Where is all this thick potent chakra coming from?

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.590
It's probably from everyone trapped in the Infinite Tsukuyomi!

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.420
This is really bad, Sasuke!

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.920
This chakra is much stronger than Ten Tails'!

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.290
Stop them before they move!

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.790
Go, Naruto!

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.130
You mean while they're still swelling up, right?

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.040
Like two moths flying into the flame…

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.710
I'm going to absorb all the chakra out of the two of you right now.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.000
Damn it!

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.290
Don't, Sakura!

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.960
But!

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.380
Action without a plan is meaningless.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:56.420
Damn it!

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.290
I can't move!

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.090
Sasuke! If we don't stop him now…

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.460
He'll drain everyone else's chakra before ours and they'll all die!

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.840
Don't worry, no one is going to die.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.460
Even when Kaguya previously cast

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.170
the Infinite Tsukuyomi upon the populace,

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.920
she kept them alive and preserved…

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.290
…in order to form them into her soldiers.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.920
"Form"? What do you mean?!

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.880
You seem to be denser than Itachi.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.590
How can one use ordinary people in combat?

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:38.790
You're not saying that—!

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.380
She converted them into White Zetsu.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:48.210
What's left of those who were under the previous Infinite Tsukuyomi…

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.420
That's what White Zetsu are.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.210
They've been transformed ever so slowly over time.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.920
Are you saying everyone's gonna turn into those white things?!

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.290
What are you saying, Black Zetsu?

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.420
The Infinite Tsukuyomi is an Uchiha Jutsu!

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.710
One that brings eternal peace to the shinobi world.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.540
And what do you base that on?

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:21.210
The Sage of the Six Paths… carved that into the stone tablet.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.380
My dear Madara…

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:34.210
I have been around for eons longer than you.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.130
Since finding the stone tablet left by Hagoromo,

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.500
I've had quite some time to make revisions.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.210
Did you say "revisions"?

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.250
The Infinite Tsukuyomi is not a jutsu

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.500
that confers peaceful dreams.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.880
It is a jutsu to amass enormous amounts of chakra

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.670
from individuals enslaved in it.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.380
For what purpose?

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:00.460
You acted merely for that purpose.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.250
According to my… rather, Kaguya's will.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.130
I wouldn't! For that?!

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:11.250
Just as you used Obito as a pawn…

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.750
You too, were merely a pawn.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.210
Hey! Look at how big he swelled up!

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.420
He's bloated because

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.590
his body can't tolerate the amount of chakra he absorbed!

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.460
At this rate, he's going to explode!

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.290
Why?

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.380
Why did this happen—?

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:38.000
Hashirama… Where…did I go wrong?

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.250
He's shrinking?!

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.170
Obito!

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.710
Isn't she the one Super Gramps talked about?

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.750
Otsutsuki…

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.130
Kaguya!

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.640
Who is she?

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.770
And why did Madara suddenly become her?

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.770
This chakra is far greater then Madara's!

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.230
I can't believe such a person ever existed!

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.190
Hagoromo knew she would appear, that's why he gave us…

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.060
Sakura, do not make any inadvertent moves right now.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.600
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: She of the Beginning

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.230
What are your intentions?!

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:28.770
SHE OF THE BEGINNING Tune in again!
