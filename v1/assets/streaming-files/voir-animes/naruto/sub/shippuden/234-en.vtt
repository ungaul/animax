WEBVTT

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.690
Sasuke!
Why?!

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.520
You're all still as noisy as ever!

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.310
Why the hell are you here, bastard?!

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.900
Why are you here, Sasuke?

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.060
A lot of things have happened.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.310
I've decided to protect the Leaf Village.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.270
And then, I'll...

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.190
become Hokage.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.600
What?!

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.350
Okay then!

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.810
Team 7 is... finally back!

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.730
Let's go, Sakura! Sasuke!

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.300
Team 7, Assemble!

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.970
That sight sure brings back memories, doesn't it, Shikamaru?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.260
Well, if he's willing to help us defeat the enemy,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.840
I won't turn him away.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.260
Even though I don't want to accept him...

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.430
It's been a long time since our class has been back together.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.090
I haven't felt like this since the Chunin Exam.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.720
I'm going to become Hokage!

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.010
Hey, are you guys even listening?!

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.760
Kiba, no one's paying attention right now and it's pitiful.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.510
Stop it.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.680
It's because the impact of Sasuke's sudden appearance

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.590
and his declaration to become Hokage are much too great.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.180
Kiba, I heard you!

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.260
We should all aspire to become Hokage!

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.550
Let's show them what we're made of, ya know!

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.590
Sasuke… What are you thinking right now?

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.840
Okay then!

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.090
Wait a minute!
Huh?!

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.340
It's that thing again!

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.970
It wants to break the barrier!

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.680
Fellow previous Hokage!

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.050
Please re-focus and prepare yourselves!

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.380
We know that!

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.090
Now then...

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.880
It held up!

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.720
What an amazing barrier…

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.090
To be able to keep that thing out…

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.970
Where's the Ten Tails?!

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.720
That Ten Tails, he hit himself!

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.470
It's not some simple barrier!

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.630
Wow… The previous Hokage were truly amazing people!

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.970
Looks like they weren't just all talk.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.180
Wood Style: Wood Clone Jutsu!

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.130
I'll make entry points on all four sides of the barrier,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.510
so shinobi can go in and out!

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.760
Follow me!

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.130
All right! Go!

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.840
Right!

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.050
It's not over yet!

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.260
Sage Arts: Gracious Deity Gates!

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.880
Head Seal!

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.930
Now then, time to deal with you.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.130
Sorry to keep you waiting, Madara…

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.050
No...

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.970
A clone is no fun.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.300
I'll wait for the real one to show up.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.510
Now!

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.550
Fission Beings?

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.430
It's trying to keep us away from its real body!

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.260
Don't waver!

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.680
Yes… I…

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.090
I…

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.970
Sasuke!

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.180
Demon Wind Shuriken, Windmill of Shadows!

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.050
Over here!

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.930
Quit joking around!

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.510
Summoning Jutsu!

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.050
Take that for now.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.220
Then eat this!

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.550
This kid...impossible!

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.470
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu!

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.720
That's right… Ever since I was a genin,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.430
I thought I was a full-fledged kunoichi.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.220
But I ended up hiding behind Sasuke and Naruto.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.720
The two of them risked everything to protect me.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.720
I hated the way I was.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.090
I swore then, that next time,

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.510
I would make them stare at my back!

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.300
Even I... Even I can…

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.260
Now it's your turn to gaze at my back!

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.470
That's what I vowed back then…

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.130
But Naruto and Sasuke kept progressing faster and faster…

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.590
So I gave up…

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.880
Thinking it was useless because they were just too strong!

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.590
I thought I'd never be able to catch up to them.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.050
But… Naruto!

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.180
Sasuke!

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.510
Stop!

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.590
Both of you, stop!

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.090
I didn't think about it…

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.260
and I put the entire burden on Naruto.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.220
I went crying to you.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.930
I held onto you, expecting you to make it all better.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.760
While I did nothing.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.340
I'm sorry, Naruto.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.550
You may have to wait for me a little bit.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.510
Next time I'm coming with you!

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.130
Please take me on as your apprentice!

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.680
Cha!

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.090
Your movements are getting better!

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.260
By the way, do you remember the first thing I taught you?

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.050
Of course.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.130
Medic Ninja must never get themselves killed.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.550
Thus they must never force their way forward.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.680
That is true…

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.630
However, that does not mean that

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.050
you don't have to learn jutsu necessary to fight on the frontline.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.930
First and foremost, you are my disciple.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.630
A kunoichi who will inherit the power of the Legendary Sannin.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.880
And…Sakura Haruno…

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.970
You are also the disciple of the Fifth Hokage!

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.380
And...

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.260
I just now reached full capacity. And I can finally unleash it!

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.800
Cha!

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.050
I am never, ever talking back to Sakura ever again.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.760
She'll destroy me.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.800
What monster strength!

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.220
It might just be greater than Tsuna's!

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.180
Amassing chakra at a continuous rate over three years…

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.590
requiring extremely delicate chakra control.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.260
The 100 Healings Mark that I couldn't even achieve.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.180
And I have no need to keep up a youthful appearance!

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.050
Wind Style…

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.340
Inferno Style…

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.930
- Rasen Shuriken! - Flame Control!

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.340
Sasuke!

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.090
Um…

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.260
I'm here too…Sakura!

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.590
Don't drag us down, Naruto.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.090
He's right! Keep complaining and

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.680
I'll just grab the title of Hokage away from you!

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.090
Huh?

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.130
Not you too, Sakura?!

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.130
This time, we fight with our backs to each other!

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.550
Lady Tsunade…

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.970
I've finally caught up with these two.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.040
So this is how Nine Tails Chakra looks under control...

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.340
A new Sharingan… with black flames…

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.750
That Naruto…

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.500
He's even mastered changing the Rasengan's nature...

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.250
Sakura's holding her own!

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.590
Hey, Team 8! Let's go too!

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.630
We can't let Team 7 show us up!

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.340
Right!

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.460
I've worked out a new jutsu too, Naruto!

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.250
Don't think you're the only one with this jutsu!

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.340
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.750
Did you just say Shadow Clone Jutsu?

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.460
All you did was make one clone!

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.040
Back in the day, I could make a lot more...

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.460
Just watch!

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.000
There may be just one, but he's three times stronger!

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.420
Come on, Akamaru!

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.840
We're gonna attack the enemy!

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.590
Inuzuka Style!

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.750
Man-Beast Team Transformation Combo!

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.630
Three-Headed Wolf!

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.460
Sasuke's joke was disgusting. But it's revving me up!

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.340
Tail Chasing…

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.500
Rotating Fang!

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.460
Parasitic Gigantic Beetle...

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.420
Infestation!

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.880
Gross! What are those?!

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.340
Parasitic Gigantic Beetles…

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.250
If you mistake the amount of chakra to give them,

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.790
they'll devour your flesh and undergo rapid growth.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.130
They are beetles that are difficult to nurture.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.250
Two Palms! Four Palms! Eight Palms!

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.460
Sixteen Palms!

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.750
Thirty-Two Palms!

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.750
I guess this is still my limit... No such thing.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.210
But I'm not like you, Neji…

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.710
If you set limits on yourself,

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.590
you'll never be able to catch up to him…

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:50.880
Overcome your limits, fearlessly take a giant leap forward.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.590
That's the…

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.630
Sixty-Four Palms!

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.540
...trick to achieve the Sixty-Four Palms.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.460
Naruto is always striving to get ahead.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.460
And I…

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.920
...want to keep standing by Naruto forever!

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.460
This time, I'll proceed to

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.340
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms like this!

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.460
So I'll continuously move forward as well!

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.630
Come on, Team 10!

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.090
Let's attack with the Ino-Shika-Cho Combination!

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.040
Formation E!

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.710
This isn't the Chunin Exam.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.090
We're not competing against the other teams.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.090
This is war…

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.630
But we want to show them what we're made of, right?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.500
Expansion Jutsu!

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.340
Shadow Grasping Jutsu!

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.710
Twenty-five enemy signatures picked up and locked on!

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.040
Sensory Relay!

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.250
Human Boulder Yo-Yo!

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.840
I'm going to expand even more.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.710
Can you handle more weight?

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.540
Yeah… You're still light.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.500
And besides, this isn't quite flashy enough to impress.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.210
What? Who's being super competitive now?

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.380
Actually, I'm technically on Team 7 too, you know...

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.920
I'll quickly attack the main body from the air!

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.090
Sai!

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.090
Sai!

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.500
Are you all right?!

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:29.880
Yes…

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:34.460
It's no good!

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.630
The enemy keeps increasing in numbers.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.920
Not only that… Some are huge!

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.210
These big ones...sure are heavy!

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.670
Naruto… Can you share your chakra with everyone again?

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.340
I can't right now!

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.590
Kurama hasn't finished amassing chakra yet!

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.210
In order to take down the main body,

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.130
we need to mow down the big ones and slip past them.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.250
The distance is too great to make a single leap for it.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.630
We also need time to weave signs and repel the enemy's attacks.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.750
Without your chakra, Naruto,

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.590
it's very likely we'll suffer heavy casualties.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.540
And the Medical Corps can't come up to the front.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.460
Mow down and slip past?

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.840
Easy.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.960
This guy has the power to clear the distance in a single leap

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.540
and repel enemy attacks.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.880
I can now stay nearby and

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.750
heal anyone who suffers serious injuries at all times.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.000
- Summoning Jutsu! - Summoning Jutsu!

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.320
See the gigantic guy way in the back?

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.820
Could you get me closer to it with a big leap?

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.780
I need you to just keep advancing forward.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.490
I'll get the real body in the back.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.820
Lady Katsuyu, please divide and

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.700
attend to each person in the Allied Shinobi Forces.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.240
Our role will be to heal everyone.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.740
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The New Three."

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.700
It is a new era!

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:09.530
THE NEW THREE Tune in again!
