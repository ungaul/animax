WEBVTT

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.320
How dare you…

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.400
How dare you!

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.780
What?!

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.820
Hey, he's exactly like the…

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.440
How dare you do that to Ginkaku!

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.400
He's just like the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki!

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.030
What is that?

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.530
There's more of them?!

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.530
It's been a while since I've seen that happen to Kinkaku.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.940
So I guess Ginkaku's a goner.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.440
The red and blue balance of your Tailed Beast chakra looks good!

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.070
Go, Naruto!

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.440
Here I go, Tailed Beast Rasengan…

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.400
Concentrate!

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.610
Didn't work, eh.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.690
You were close. That's a shame!

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.400
You lost your focus! And you have yourself to blame!

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.150
What was that feeling I just felt?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.580
Golden Bonds

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.540
This is really not good.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.630
I apologize!

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.080
It's too late for that!

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.170
After all, huh?!

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.040
What is that? A Jinchuriki?

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.540
I-I owe you one… But what the hell is that…?

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.250
Since we're now allies, I guess it's okay to tell you.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.750
Long before Madara Uchiha tamed the Nine Tails…

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.670
the Hidden Cloud tried to capture the natural calamity

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.500
known as the Nine Tails.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.880
During the attempt, the Nine Tails devoured Lords Kinkaku and Ginkaku…

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.000
and then they were expelled.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.460
Expelled? You mean from behind?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.710
Don't be ridiculous! Just go and report to Headquarters!

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.290
Request for instructions!

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.710
R-Right.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.210
Where are the reinforcements?!

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.750
What's the status of Darui's First Company?!

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.500
One of the enemy's strongmen, Ginkaku,

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.670
seems to have been captured.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.540
But Kinkaku is on a rampage, cloaked in the Nine Tails' Cloak!

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.130
Go, Mabui! Start preparations!

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.040
Yes sir!

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.920
A transformed Kinkaku will be uncontrollable.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.920
Transformed?

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.920
I get that he has the Nine Tails' chakra, but he's not a Jinchuriki…

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.540
They were inside the Nine Tails for two weeks.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.290
Apparently, they survived by eating the Nine Tails' entrails.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.170
No one else has ever eaten

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.420
the chakra-rich flesh of the Nine Tails.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.630
No, I take that back.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.500
There was a fellow in the Hidden Cloud

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.580
who ate the Eight Tails' legs.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.080
But he died without becoming a Jinchuriki.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.080
Those two brothers must be exceptional.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.880
They must be related to the Sage of the Six Paths.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.130
Then how can we subdue him?

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.540
There is just one way.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.710
Kinkaku has enormous chakra and power.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.630
In order to seal them, we will take advantage of

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.080
the last of their Treasured Tools and use it on him.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.830
Follow me.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.040
If I can just seal that one in this gourd too…

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.710
In order to do that though,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.750
I need the Kokinjo to squeeze out his spirit word.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.540
But that rope is on his left arm covered by the Nine Tails' Cloak.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.420
I can't get it.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.330
Captain Darui! We got word from HQ!

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.880
They are sending the Kohaku no Johei.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.630
I see…

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.500
That would be better than this gourd.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.750
This is the Kohaku no Johei, one of the five Treasured Tools,

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.710
that was used to seal the Eight Tails.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.290
It's more like a pot than a bottle.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.000
It differs from the gourd, Benihisago, in that…

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.040
if the target answers the call of whoever is holding the pot,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.920
his voice is immediately recorded and he becomes sealed.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.670
We managed to take this away from Kinkaku.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.580
We will send this to Darui!

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.130
But the situation is urgent.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.290
Won't it take long to deliver this?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.630
Lord Raikage…

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.960
It is done! We can send this to Darui anytime!

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.290
Mabui uses the Object Teleportation Jutsu

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.210
that transports matter at the speed of light.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.750
That is precisely why she is my personal assistant.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.670
But if it once belonged to them,

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.500
surely they know how to counter this tool?

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.500
Although it will depend on how you make him answer and seal him.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.460
Then, I have an idea.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.000
Any strategy you come with is sure to work.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.250
I leave it to you!

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.580
Do it, Mabui!

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.380
Ethereal Transmission Jutsu!

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.790
Make sure you get it, Darui.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.500
We are blessed with fine aides, aren't we, Tsunade?

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960
You are right.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.880
It's here!

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.580
That's the Kohaku no Johei that was once in our possession.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.500
I see…

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.710
You intend to seal me with that.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.040
I'm glad it's here…

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.380
But Kinkaku knows how this tool works.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.880
How am I supposed to seal him?

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.000
Well, HQ came up with this strategy.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.380
Until I know what that is, I'll guard it!

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.500
Sorry, I can't afford to let you catch me.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.040
Protect Captain Darui with your lives!

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.790
Fire Style Squad! Go!

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.580
Water Style Squad!

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.960
Weaklings!

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.330
Earth Style Squad!

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.210
Sorry about this…

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.920
Double Black Panthers!

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:10.670
Did he do it?

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.880
Why you—!

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.540
I'll tear you all apart!

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.460
They've all been defeated…

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.380
by just one man.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:54.000
A barrage of Fire, Water, Earth and Lightning Styles had no effect.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.630
Forgive me, everyone…

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.680
Shikaku, this jutsu won't last long.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.730
I know, please do it.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:21.600
Darui…

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.560
It's Shikaku from Headquarters! Listen to me.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.390
I've been waiting to hear from you…

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.730
You have the Kohaku no Johei, don't you?

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.350
For this plan to be successful,

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.230
the Ino-Shika-Cho Formation is absolutely critical.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.930
Please hold on until they get there.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.980
Ino-Shika-Cho… That's…

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.980
But Shikaku and Inoichi are still at HQ…

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.770
We've lost so many men already.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.890
To hold on is a really tall order.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.640
Where did he go?

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.310
Kikuchi!

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.680
Sorry I'm late!

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:15.810
Look! Reinforcements!

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.350
Over here!

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.680
Now, we can keep on fighting!

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:27.980
It's a strategy from HQ!

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.980
We'll strike Kinkaku with the Ino-Shika-Cho Formation.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.310
Until they get here, we'll have to hold this location!

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.980
They're coming? Then we can't give up yet…

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.770
Listen! Shikamaru, Choji, Ino…

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.640
I am using Inoichi's Jutsu

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.730
to communicate directly with my thoughts.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.060
Listen carefully to what I say.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.140
I see… So that's the plan.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:08.100
I understand.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.890
So we're gonna take care of this monster Kinkaku

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.180
who killed the Second Hokage!

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.890
What a drag.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.640
I feel a little scared.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.100
Hey, you guys… Don't chicken out on me.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.140
Legends become exaggerated over time.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:34.600
And when a legend is surpassed, new legends are born.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.850
He may have the power of the Nine Tails,

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.980
but we have the power of the Ino-Shika-Cho bond.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:53.600
The Ino-Shika-Cho bond ranks in the top two of ninjutsu legends.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.770
Be confident!

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.020
Do not back down! We must hold the line!

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.020
More reinforcements…

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.600
Sorry we're late.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.640
He…

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.140
How could he…?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.980
Hurrah! Yes!

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.980
Reinforcements!

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.480
– First Company reinforcements… – Are you serious?!

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.890
and now, the Fourth Company has arrived!

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:35.890
– Hey, hey… – We can win!

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.310
– Do you get the feeling that… – The tide will turn now!

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.890
there's a lot of hope riding on us?

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.060
Were we like that?

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.390
Kinda makes me nervous.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.890
Then, it'll be shameful if I don't live up to their expectations.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.680
Hey! They're the children's version of the Ino-Shika-Cho Formation!

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:52.640
– Huh?! – What?!

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.310
Hey, can they pull it off?

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.350
Well, I figured they'd say that.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.810
Me too.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.350
Hey, hey… A new legend will be born here.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.770
So let's just do it!

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.680
Yeah, I know.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.600
Uh-huh.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:09.930
Everyone, cover them!

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.810
Hurl your kunai!

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.850
You third-rate underlings!

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.520
How is it going?

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.680
You're just weaklings…

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.100
As if you can bring me down!

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.730
Human Boulder!

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.270
Why you…

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.430
Shadow Possession complete!

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.480
One petty trick after another…

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.430
What extraordinary power…

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.810
This is nothing. I can break it in an instant.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.810
He broke through the Shadow Possession!

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.930
Die!

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.930
Nice timing, Ino…

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.430
Got him! Mind Transfer Jutsu complete!

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.350
All right.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.560
Kinkaku!

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:26.810
Yes!

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.600
Why you—!

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:42.770
Come back, Ino!

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.430
We, who were touted as the shining light of the Cloud…

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.730
to be taken down by the likes of them!

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:02.600
Gold and silver coins may be shinier and worth more than copper coins.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.730
But pool them together and

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.980
copper coins will have equal or greater value than a gold coin.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.640
You may be gold, but it seems you were fool's gold.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.850
That is why we won.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.890
I'm sorry we peeled off your gold plating…

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:27.810
Ino!

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.310
Choji!

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.140
For being scared, you did pretty good, Choji!

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.930
I feel like I lost a ton of weight from all that cold sweat.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.680
That was just a feeling. You look fine, the same as always.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.850
It went exactly as planned.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.270
Well done, Choji.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.980
You've gotten good at controlling

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.060
the speed and release of your Mind Transfer, Ino.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.770
Units 6 through 10, search for wounded!

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.680
The rest, follow me!

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.680
The rope that squeezes out Spirit Words

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.730
has been sealed along with Kinkaku…

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.020
So he can't use the Ninja Tool.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.680
Now then, one more Ninja Tool… Where is the Bashosen?

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.480
Let's go, Choji…Ino!

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.600
Already?

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.730
C'mon, stand up.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.600
Th-That's…!

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.270
Long time no see, you Ino-Shika-Cho brats.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.230
You're Kakuzu, right?

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.350
We took the "Gold."

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.890
As for the "bishop," we know your tricks and how good you are…

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.140
From now on, we're on the offensive.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.350
The brat who uses shadows.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:25.310
Your being here means that Hidan has been stopped, huh?

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.600
Did he get his head chopped off again while he was praying?

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:36.140
Or does it mean he's not here because he's still alive?

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.930
As if we know what he's doing while he's rotting away somewhere!

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.310
So I don't have a rook,

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.730
my gold and silver were taken and I'm completely on the defensive.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.930
That's the fifth one.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.680
That's right…

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.730
That guy has five hearts, so we have to bring him down five times.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.930
Yeah, you're right.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.520
Time to finish the game.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:22.100
By the way… We have gold and silver too.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.390
Would you be interested in who they might be?

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.600
Dan Kato… Lady Tsunade's lover.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.520
And…

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.680
Asuma Sarutobi.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.730
The son of the Third Hokage and your teacher.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.020
Asuma Sensei!

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.160
On the next Special Episode!

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.990
Sakura suddenly comes falling from the sky!

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.830
The shock of a hard landing causes her to lose her memory!

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.120
Everyone in the village lends a hand

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.740
to help her regain her memories, but…

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.990
Just what in the world is happening?!

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.990
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Road to Sakura"

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.870
I wonder if there's chance for me to make an appearance in this one?

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.780
Tune in again!
