WEBVTT

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.830
Infiltration is a success. That was quite easy.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.800
Now then...

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200
What is it?

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.930
Someone is disturbing my rain.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.270
This chakra... He is strong.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.770
All right, where do I search first?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.570
Hot, hot!

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.570
I'll have one of these, Granny...

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.600
Thank you.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.930
I haven't seen your face before.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.870
You're not from around here?

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.530
Well... I'm a writer.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.830
I travel around and write

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.770
about regional cuisine and products for a magazine.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.200
Hmm... I see. And how do you like my pork buns?

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.170
Oh, they're delicious.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.300
I heard about them, and they're amazing.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.130
I know! Aren't they?

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.370
I'd like to introduce them in our magazine. Is that okay?

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.770
In a magazine?

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.100
Yes. Although, once I write about them,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.330
you'll have such a big crowd you won't be able to rest.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.400
I-I see. That would be a problem!

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.170
It sure is peaceful around here.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.770
Yes.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.770
This village is no longer plagued by war thanks to Lord Pain.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.700
We're so grateful to him.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.500
Pain?

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.530
Yes, Lord Pain.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.970
What happened to Hanzo of the Salamander?

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.200
Huh?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.000
Hanzo of the...

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.670
Thanks for your time, Granny.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.330
"THE ORIGINAL" PORK BUNS

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.170
Thank you for waiting.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.770
Say...

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.870
What is that?

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.900
Huh?

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.870
Oh, that is Lady Angel.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.870
You don't know?

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.570
They say it's good fortune to put up origami

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.670
shaped after the Lady Angel at the shop entrance.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.070
An Angel...

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.930
What is going on? This land isn't divided into two.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.730
Instead it's already united.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.800
And the Hidden Rain Village used to have a leader

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.870
named Hanzo of the Salamander...

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.070
It seems I need to check this place out very thoroughly.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.400
MAKE-OUT PUB WAR

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.430
Looks like it's going to be an intense battle!

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.600
Oh sir... Surely, you jest...

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.470
No, I can't tell lies. All of it is true.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.330
Is that so? I'm flattered.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.070
Oh, what an intense battle this is!

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.900
You have good taste for choosing me, Mister.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.200
Well Tezuna, you look just like someone I know...

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.570
Your names are similar too, so I couldn't help but request for you.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.370
It was well worth the long journey here.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.930
Oh, you're not from around here?

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.530
Hmm, well I heard there might be work for a mercenary like me, so I came.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.770
If I recall, it was Hanzo of the Salamander who...

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.830
Shh! Don't talk about such things here!

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.430
Oh...? Why not?

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.970
If they think you're one of Hanzo's associates, you'll be killed!

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.430
Oh... That's disturbing news!

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.170
The new leader, Lord Pain, is very strict...

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.700
He'll show no mercy to anyone he suspects.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.100
That is what my hubby says.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.200
What?! Are you married, Tezuna?

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:01.470
Well... My hubby is just a village genin and doesn't earn much. I have to work.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.170
That's harsh...

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.230
According to my hubby,

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.270
Lord Pain makes it rain in this village with his jutsu.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.070
The rain can tell him what everybody is doing.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.030
Hmm... That's a scary jutsu.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.470
So it's better to watch what we talk about.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.470
Tezuna!

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.830
Excuse me a minute.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.430
So I'm already under his watch...

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.430
"I'm coming home now with a present"? Yeah right.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.430
He's probably buying something at the gift shop by Shibuki Bridge!

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.270
Hmph! What a sad piece of writing...

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.130
Konan... When I stop the rain, seek out the intruder with your jutsu.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.430
Got it.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.000
Ready?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400
Yes...

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.430
What a downpour.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.070
Wanna get a drink while we wait for the rain to stop?

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.170
There are no bars at a low ground level like this.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.400
We'll have to go up higher.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.530
Then let's head upwards for some cover.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.630
But are you sure?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.970
Didn't you tell your wife you're heading straight home?

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.430
Heh! It's okay. It's an emergency mission!

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.470
I never heard of drinking being a mission...

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.930
GRAND OPENING CLUB FROG

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.530
Heh heh... We're in luck.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.970
Welcome.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.700
Just two.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.930
Give us sake and some chasers.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.200
Today's not Sunday, is it?

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.970
Something must have come up for Lord Pain.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.300
Maybe he's leaving for another nation.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.430
But it never rained on other days before.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.430
Maybe it's something that requires that much power.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.470
But if it keeps on raining like this...

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.530
Hey! Careful with the words!

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.530
Lord Pain works tirelessly for the people of this village.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.630
Show some tolerance!

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.300
Guess you're right...

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.470
Sorry to keep you fellows waiting.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.400
Hey... But there's nothing!

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.870
No, no... You're in luck!

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.800
Today, we have our grand opening special.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.300
What? Really?!

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.930
What kind of service?

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.030
The Club Frog Special Torture Service.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.600
You...! Who the hell are you?!

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.370
I'm the one asking the questions. And I have a lot to ask.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.170
Now! Run!

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.500
What?!

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.600
Give it up.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.530
"Infiltrate! The Village Hidden in the Rain"

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.030
Do it, Konan.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:43.530
Right...

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.670
Now then...

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.100
From your use of kunai, I'm guessing you two are lowly ninjas.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.700
Am I correct?

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.370
Does that rogue ninja mark signify that you're loyal to Pain?

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.630
Dammit!

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.400
Where are we?!

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.970
Inside the belly of a frog.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:28.570
You'll never be found here... No one will come to your aid!

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.070
Who the hell are you?!

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:36.470
I told you I'll be the one asking questions. Remember?

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.170
Wh-What're you gonna do with that feather?

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.970
Tickle you!

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:46.230
If you don't want to die laughing, then you'll answer my questions.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.030
Regarding your leader...Pain.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.800
Now talk! Tell me everything you know about Pain!

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.370
Bear with it!

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.500
I won't...rat...on my comrade...

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.830
You're pretty stubborn, aren't you?

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.030
Well, I have another trick.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.270
Wh-What're you gonna do?!

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:21.130
If you refuse to talk, then I'll use my jutsu and flog you to frogs!

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.870
Flog...you...to frogs...

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.170
What do you want from us?!

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.930
Now talk!

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.500
We may be lowly ninjas, but we'll never betray our comrades!

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.230
No matter what you do to us! So don't take us lightly!

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.270
Hmm... Then I have no choice...

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.230
Ninja Art! Toad Transformation!

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.470
Stop!!

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.670
You bastard! That's not fair!

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.230
Now then, you're next.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.430
Are you ready?

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.100
The highest tower in the west... Lord Pain is there.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.130
That's what people say...

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.370
Huh? What?! You sure turned on him easily...didn't you?

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.870
Well, no matter...

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.300
What did you mean by, "that's what people say"?

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.830
Actually... No one really knows that much about Lord Pain.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.300
What do you mean?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.700
They say he is from Fuma Clan lineage.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.400
But no one really knows what he looks like.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.470
And some claim that he doesn't even exist.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:02.200
I walked through the town a bit... and everyone seems to worship him.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.330
So don't lie!

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.800
In this town, Lord Pain is a god.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.100
It's not a question of whether he exists or not.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.970
He always watches over us.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.970
He has a representative do all the ceremonial rites,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.070
the speeches and the issuing of orders...

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.070
Through the Lady Angel!

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.300
Lady Angel...?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.200
He's your leader, isn't he?

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.270
Why must he hide his appearances from you too?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.000
For times like this one.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.700
I see...

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.730
You're not a remnant of the old Hidden Rain, are you?

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.830
Just who are you?

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.300
Never mind about me.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.270
What's this about the old Hidden Rain remnants?

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.770
Heh... You really don't know a thing, do you?

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.730
So you're an outsider.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.930
Until recently, those remnants would infiltrate.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.730
But that's not a worry anymore.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:06.170
Only lucky fellows like you ever manage to slip in from the outside.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.770
Not a worry? What do you mean?

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.700
I heard that this land was going through a civil war...

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.400
It's not surprising that you haven't heard.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.400
This nation is closed to the outside.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.030
Well, I'll tell you...

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.270
The civil war ended long ago. And we won!

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.400
That's why Lord Pain is legendary.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.130
He destroyed the Hidden Rain... by himself.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.370
I can't believe it...

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.570
No matter how powerful this Pain might be,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.830
the leader of the Hidden Rain was Hanzo of the Salamander.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.970
And there's not a soul in the ninja world that doesn't know him.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.930
That's right.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.270
But not only was Hanzo powerful, he was extremely cautious

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.230
and made it very difficult for anyone to approach him.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.930
He had bodyguards on 24-hour duty, and everyone, including children,

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.300
who went near him were strip searched.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:15.530
So how did he defeat Hanzo? What ability does Pain possess?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.030
I told you. We don't know anything!

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.430
To think you would drive me into a corner...

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.230
You are young, but capable.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.730
I predict the Hidden Leaf shall emerge victorious from this battle.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.970
Therefore, I shall let you three live.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.930
We don't want your sympathy! We can still fight!

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.230
Jiraiya, stop!

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.600
You three are strong.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.470
And you managed to survive and give me a tough time.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.170
I will give you time.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.500
Become stronger and come fight me again!

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.670
In exchange for your lives, tell me your names.

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:08.170
Jiraiya!

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.130
Tsunade!

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.170
Orochimaru...

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.900
Your names have been carved into my memory...

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.070
Jiraiya! Tsunade! Orochimaru!

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:25.070
I, Hanzo, hereby name you the "Hidden Leaf's Sannin."

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.000
I can't believe it... He defeated Hanzo by himself?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.870
He's a god. He wields formidable jutsu.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.330
But that is not why Lord Pain is to be feared.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:50.470
What is truly frightening is his merciless heart of steel.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:56.270
Everyone who threatened his ideals was ruthlessly extinguished.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.230
He didn't stop with just Hanzo.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.600
Hanzo's parents, his wife and child...

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.230
His relatives and friends, and even their infants, were killed.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.570
Then he burned down their homes.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:12.430
And he killed the emissaries of villages allied with Hanzo.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.800
He erased them all.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.900
It was retribution...

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.600
Just like a god, don't you think?

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.170
A god...

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.730
Yes...

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.900
Then, just what is your god trying to accomplish?

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.630
Even underlings like you must know.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.230
It's the work of a god. We wouldn't know what he plans.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.030
I see... Then if not god...

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:59.670
you must at least know something about the Akatsuki.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.370
Never heard of such a name.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.300
Your arms and legs are bound, so that you cannot move.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.900
But that's not all...

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.470
Your pulse is being measured.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.870
And if you lie, I'll know instantly.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.400
Tell me everything you know!

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.300
Otherwise, you will end up surviving off dragonflies and flies

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.000
for the rest of your life.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.630
Now then... Time to hunt the infiltrator.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.570
I taught you ninjutsu to enable you to live through those harsh times.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.000
You were all, without a doubt, my students.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.400
The world may still be a cruel place,

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.800
but to attack me without a greeting... This is too sad.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.300
You know nothing about what happened to us afterwards.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.030
No, I don't. However, what the Akatsuki is doing is wrong!

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.800
That is the decision I've made, Jiraiya Sensei.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:05.200
Next time: "The Man Who Became God"

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.830
Hehe, a date with Sakura tonight!

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.900
It's because you said it's lonely to go to the festival alone!

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.970
Hey, I smell ikayaki! You're treating!

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.870
Hey, wait Sakura!

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.500
- Yay, choco-banana! - Roger...

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.670
- Hey, yakisoba! - Roger!

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.530
- Takoyaki! - Roger!

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.870
- Yo-Yo fishing! - Roger...

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.730
- Yay, candy apple! - I'm cashed-out...

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.130
It's gotten quiet, hasn't it?

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:39.970
- Huh?! - Huh?!

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.100
- It can't be a ghost... - Of course not.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.400
Ghost!

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.030
Sakura!

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.730
What do you think you're doing?!

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.100
B-But you...!

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.100
Huh?

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.170
I hope we can see the fireworks together like this next year too.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.030
Yeah!

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.430
Tune in again!
