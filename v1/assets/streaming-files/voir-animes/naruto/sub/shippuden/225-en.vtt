WEBVTT

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.780
The Ties that Bind

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.080
This is the Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu!

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.910
How pitiful.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.030
Yeah.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.370
This hope that they're all clinging to doesn't exist.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.990
Just like their very lives, at this point.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.490
It seems Ten Tails is ready.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.240
Fifth Gate of Closing! Open!

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.120
So this time, they're coming after us, not Ten Tails...

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.660
Well...

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.240
Taking the enemy's brains is a fundamental strategy...

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.450
I'll follow the strategy and...

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.660
take down those two, who are the brains of the Ten Tails!

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.950
For that to work...

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.080
they would need to stop the Ten Tails first!

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.910
What?! I thought we had immobilized the Ten Tails!

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.330
Are you okay?! Damn it...

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.910
My shoulder's dislocated...

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.200
Look at the Sensing Water Sphere...

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.030
It's practically like a small planet.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.370
But that's...impossible!

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.990
So we didn't immobilize Ten Tails, after all?

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.990
It merely stopped moving on its own

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.280
in order to amass power and undergo transformation?

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.410
How are we going to be able to stop it?

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.240
And now we can't target those two either!

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.950
But we have to stop that thing or else it's over for us.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.450
I'm about to pee myself...

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.240
Instead of freaking out, infuse your chakra!

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.160
Be ready to move as soon as we get the plan from HQ!

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.080
We must immobilize Ten Tails...

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.620
or else we can't go after the brains that are controlling it...

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.910
But how?

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.080
Even with the jutsu of my clan who specialize in immobilizing...

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.910
the effect would be miniscule compared to the amount of chakra expended.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.660
Inoichi!

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.990
Link me to Kakashi!

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.030
Roger!

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.990
Kakashi, it's me!

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.200
There's something I want to confirm

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.160
regarding the intel from the last battle sequence...

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.910
It's going to start getting more difficult to control Ten Tails soon...

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.410
Reinforce your bond with it using Hashirama's cells.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.160
Don't you want to check out Ten Tails' power in its current state?

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.780
First, let's... Yes, let's show them...

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.990
...despair!

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.120
Shikaku, I'm going to let you go for now!

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.370
What's the matter?!

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.830
This is... No way!

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.450
Lord Shikaku! Lord Inoichi!

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.910
My Kamui won't make it in time!

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.120
Displace it upwards using an Earth Style technique.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.120
Right!

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.950
That far away?

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.950
It's so much greater than all the previous Tailed Beasts!

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.700
What power!

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.870
It's wobbly from just that little counter...

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.450
Its control isn't perfect yet.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.240
Next!

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.200
Unbelievable! Such a far-off city destroyed in an instant!

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.030
It's been acting strange for a while, it seems to be aiming far away!

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.120
So all the cities, and people are within its range of fire?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.080
Then that means the evacuated Feudal Lords,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.620
everyone protecting the villages...

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.450
plus all the citizens of each nation aren't safe?

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.330
Our shinobi on the battlefield are fighting to protect everyone else...

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.780
Those two are trying to eliminate our reason for this war.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.490
That's the direction of--!

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.410
Th-This is...

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.120
What's wrong, Lord Ao?!

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.030
Please listen to me calmly.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.870
Here, eh?

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.120
Well, Shikaku... What do we do?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.950
Just keep doing what we must do.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.120
It will be our last act.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.120
Put me through to everyone on the battlefield.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.950
I have a plan to stop the Ten Tails!

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.740
Finally got them.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.990
We've now smashed the brains of the Allied Forces.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.030
Like I said before, it's fundamental strategy.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.620
Shikamaru...

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.780
We're in the middle of a war.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.830
Don't waste any words on me.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.240
Or on Ino.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.120
Like Dad said, we just have to do what we have to do.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.910
Wait... What exactly just happened?!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.040
You are the key to our plan.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.990
Not about that!

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.610
I'm asking what happened to Shikaku and Inoichi?!

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.240
Neji! Rotate clockwise!

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.200
Got it!

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.900
- Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation! - Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation!

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.780
A-Amazing...

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.860
Don't just stand there spacing out, Naruto!

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.390
This is a battlefield and we're in a war.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.640
People will die!

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.310
But if we are defeated and lose this war...

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.430
everyone will die!

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.310
Of course I know that!

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.680
Shikamaru and Ino's father would likely say, that as shinobi,

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.970
they're glad to have died before their children.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.350
Just as my father did.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.850
Naruto, your power is critical to the plan.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.270
So until we execute it... We must protect you, Naruto!

00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.600
Hinata!

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:01.930
Know this!

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.470
The Hyuga are the mightiest among the Hidden Leaf!

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.180
There he goes... I was hoping to take them down

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.220
before they started with the speeches, but...

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.220
It's hard to control Ten Tails well.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.640
This ought to do until the next transformation, but...

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.890
Afterwards...

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.770
I suspect only a Jinchuriki will be able to control it.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.930
Though for me to become the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki...

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.310
I'll need to be fully alive,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.020
not hosted within a corpse as a Reanimation.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.270
Reanimations like you are perfect for large-scale suicidal attacks.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.350
But the reason you haven't launched

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.020
the Ten Tails Tailed Beast Bomb at them, blowing yourself up as well,

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.520
is because I'd get caught up in it and die too.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.350
And the reason that would be a problem,

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.270
is because in order for you to truly be brought back to life

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.100
and become a Jinchuriki...

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.350
you need me to sacrifice myself

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.640
and perform the Gedo Art of Rinne Rebirth on you.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.470
In short, you're in a delicate position right now

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.560
where you're entirely at my mercy.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.470
Don't forget that.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.680
Well, well, that rug rat sure has become the wily fox.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.560
I never considered you a friend.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.600
Fine then.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.470
You decide our next move then.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.180
We continue.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.180
They will know despair...thoroughly.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.470
Wood Style!

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.890
Cutting Sprigs!

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.520
There's so many of them!

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.600
Just try to evade them.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.810
My Mountain Jutsu should at least slow it down

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.470
until Nine Tails' strength returns.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.930
Except I need some time to build up enough chakra!

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.100
Hold on, everybody!

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.770
Cha!

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.890
So many!

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.810
My Rotation can't keep up!

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.470
Thanks, Neji!

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.560
I can activate Sage Mode now!

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.890
I can't keep relying on you geniuses!

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.390
Now it's my turn!

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.520
Rasen Shuriken!

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.470
Here's a few more!

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.310
Eight Trigrams: Air Wall Palm!

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.350
Damn it! A focused attack!

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.600
There's too many!

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.430
Hinata and Neji's Air Palms won't be sufficient...

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.560
Byakugan!

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.600
Earth Style! Mountain Jutsu!

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.060
Medical Team!

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.390
Where are you?! There's a critical injury here!

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.770
Hurry!

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.180
No...

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.060
I'm no longer...

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.560
Neji...

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.020
Brother...

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.770
Naruto...

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.600
Lady Hinata... is willing to die for you.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.720
So...you hold more...

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.600
than one...life in your hands...

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:49.430
And it seems...that my life too... may have been...

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.430
one of them....

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.890
Why? Why did you do this here?

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.520
You were going to change the Hyuga!

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:11.020
Long ago, those words of yours, freed me from the shackles of fate.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.600
Why would you go so far for me?

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.310
Even give up your life...

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:28.180
Because...you called me a genius...

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.770
Unlike me, you're not a failure!

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.060
Father...

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.720
I finally understand... the freedom you felt...

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.600
choosing to die in order to protect your comrades.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.020
Didn't you say you wouldn't let your friends die...?

00:13:58.890 --> 00:13:59.930
Naruto!

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.470
I'll never let my comrades die!

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:26.180
Those words... "I'll never let my comrades die."

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:32.060
Now look around you... and say it again!

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.020
I told you to say it again!

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.850
As the bodies of your comrades grow cold in your arms...

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.310
take in their deaths!

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.060
Neji's...dead?!

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.600
Hizashi, forgive me...

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.390
I let Neji--!

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.600
This will continue...

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.020
And your flippant words and ideology shall become lies.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.930
This is the end result of hope and ideals.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.180
This is reality!

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:24.390
Naruto...

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.020
What is there for you in this reality?

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.430
Your mother and father are gone, as well as your master, Jiraiya.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.100
And if you keep standing against us,

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.680
you'll continue to lose your friends one by one.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.770
This shall become a world

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.350
where no one who acknowledges you will exist.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.560
Obito...

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.060
The only thing that awaits you...

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.430
is your worst nightmare, which you know quite well!

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.430
Solitude!

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.390
You've become exactly like the old me, Obito.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.270
Naruto will give up shortly...

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.220
Which will break the will of the Allied Forces.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.680
Why must you cling to reality?

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.560
Enough of this... Now come join us, Naruto!

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.560
Brother Neji just said,

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.470
that you hold more than one life in your hands.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.720
Do you know what he meant?

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.390
"I'll never let my comrades die."

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.680
Neither those words nor the conviction behind them are lies!

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.220
Because he was able to successfully store them in his heart,

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.930
and live them out to until the end!

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.560
Brother Neji did!

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.470
It's not just you, Naruto...

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.430
We all hold those words and feelings in our hearts.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.220
They're what bind our lives together...

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.520
and make us comrades.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:27.310
If we all give up and discard those words and feelings,

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.600
Neji's final act will have been for nothing.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.560
And that is when... your comrades truly die!

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.140
For you are then no longer comrades.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.720
That's...how I feel.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:49.930
So, stand with me, Naruto.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.350
Because never going back on one's word...

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.390
is my Ninja Way too!

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:06.350
Naruto... Lady Hinata... is willing to die for you.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:12.390
So...you hold more... ...than one life!

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.060
Don't forget about me!

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.220
I know.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:17.890
I take my bonds seriously!

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.430
I'd never abandon my comrades!

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:25.970
But in reality, Neji is... Stop your rambling!

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.140
I'll beat you up and take over your body for good this time!

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.470
And did you also forget?

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.270
Your mother and father did the same thing Neji did

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.430
just after you were born.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.560
They sealed me, their archenemy inside you,

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.520
and entrusted the future to you and died.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:49.930
Your life was already linked to two others from the time you were born!

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.430
Will he just stand back and see how Naruto responds...?

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.270
It seems Naruto makes him uneasy.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.180
Enough!

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.390
Don't be hasty!

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.930
You're going to harm yourself as well as Ten Tails!

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.100
I don't care!

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.060
Ten Tails hide is tough!

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.560
They're going to hit us!

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.430
Recharging completed!

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.220
Be careful, Lord Bee!

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.560
Go get 'em!

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:29.600
Take this!

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.520
Lord Bee!

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.100
Don't go overboard!

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.350
There's no need to worry...

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.930
Protecting the Alliance is my territory!

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.560
That's right.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.720
It wasn't just Mom and Dad.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.390
Yeah... It hasn't just been my life...

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.430
up until now.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.100
Thanks, Hinata!

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.890
It's all thanks to you standing by my side.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.850
And Neji...

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.680
Thank you.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.640
Naruto's hand is so big...

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.470
and strong, but most of all...

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.470
Let's do this, Hinata!

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.430
Yeah!

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.470
It's comforting!

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.850
I haven't been able to save many comrades...

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.560
An existence where one can only await one's death inside a cage...

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.100
It's a nice analogy.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.270
You're all exactly like that brat who just died a pointless death.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.720
Neji's will isn't dead yet!

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.640
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Those Who Dance in the Shadows."

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:10.350
THOSE WHO DANCE IN THE SHADOWS Tune in again!
