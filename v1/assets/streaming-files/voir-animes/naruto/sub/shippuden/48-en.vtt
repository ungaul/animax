00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.130
I knew you'd be here.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.170
I'd expect no less from the Anbu Black Ops...

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.400
under the direct command of the Hokage.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.330
To think I wouldn't be able to deceive you with that corpse...

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.200
Now tell us everything. What's this about?

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.230
Bonds 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.730
You jerk! Why did you betray us?!

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.370
You shouldn't make too much of a commotion here.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.870
Things will get troublesome, you see.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.500
- You jerk! - Naruto!

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.770
Here...take this.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.430
It's yours, isn't it?

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.630
Thank you.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.770
It was an order from Danzo, right?

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.000
Danzo has teamed up with Orochimaru...

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.130
and is attempting to do something...

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.100
You were chosen to be the go-between...

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.100
for Danzo and Orochimaru.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.770
What're they planning...?

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.200
With Orochimaru, he's planning to...

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.230
once again destroy the Leaf Village...

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.270
Isn't that right?

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.400
No, that's not--

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.100
I can tell right away that your smile is a lie!

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.870
And I can tell right away that what you're saying is a lie!

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.170
Now that you have found me...

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.470
my mission is considered a failure.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.870
I can't handle all of you guys by myself...

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.300
And...if you know that much...

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.870
then there's no point in hiding anything.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.700
You're exactly right.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.570
We're going to crush the current Leaf Village.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.970
Say what...?!

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.630
The real mission I was given was to gain the favor of Orochimaru...

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.500
and create an opportunity for a collaboration...

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.430
in order to crush the Leaf Village.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.470
Do you know what you're saying?!

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.800
- To do such a thing-- - That's not all.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.300
I also have the duty of secretly sending...

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.930
information about Orochimaru to Lord Danzo...

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.500
In other words, I have also been entrusted with a mission as a spy.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.270
Keep going.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.370
Own up to everything you're hiding.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.600
So basically what you're saying is...

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.300
while proposing the collaboration with Orochimaru...

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.730
you're trying to outflank him?

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.230
You've been given such a dangerous mission...

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.170
Orochimaru will definitely betray us...

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.400
once the Leaf Village has been crushed.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.370
It's to make sure we've always got the advantage.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.270
I get it...

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.500
Danzo wants to make the Leaf Village his own, huh?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.670
You made preparations for that all by yourself...

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.470
The information I wrote in black ink

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.930
transforms into small animals...

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.930
and carries the information out while protecting itself, you see.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.230
This ability of mine was valued highly...

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.170
and so I was selected for this mission.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.900
Many people will die, once again...

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.470
if things become turbulent in the Leaf Village!

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.500
Do you even know why you're doing this?!

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.730
No idea... They're my orders, so...

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.730
Sai, you...

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.530
Let me tell you one more thing...

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.730
Sai is the name I was given just for this mission...

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.400
I'm nobody.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.900
I'm a tool for Lord Danzo.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.430
I don't exist.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.630
So no matter what you say to me, it's pointless.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.070
Then...

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.200
Then why...

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.200
do you hold on to that picture book with such care?!

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.430
The two kids on the cover...

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.130
are you and your older brother, right?

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.270
You're holding on to that picture book with such care...

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.900
because it's the only thing that proves your existence, isn't it?

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.570
You haven't been able to discard your emotions as completely as you say.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.700
Even Shinobi can't completely discard their emotions.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.030
As proof of that...

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.430
when I handed the picture book to you earlier...

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.470
You said thanks and took it.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.430
You were relieved to get back...

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.300
the picture book that can prove your existence.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.270
Why does having this picture book prove my own existence?

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.170
The reason why you don't want to part with that book...

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.630
is that you can't forsake yourself as a younger brother...

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.770
Do you know why?

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.930
It's because your bonds with your older brother...

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.570
were that important to you!

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.270
You don't want to erase the bonds you have with your older brother...

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:13.930
Bonds...

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.630
Sorry, but we had a look inside the picture book.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.930
Only the picture in the center-facing pages is unfinished.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.730
Sai... I also know that you're from The Foundation.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.430
And I also know that you received special training...

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.670
from Danzo in order to suppress your emotions.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.130
Special training...?

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.970
It's the same as the evil practice...

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.830
once conducted in the Village Hidden in the Mist a.k.a. Blood Mist Village,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.400
in order to take away emotions.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.370
The Blood Mist Village ... The Hidden Mist...?

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.900
That's where Zabuza's from!

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.230
Then...

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.670
A long time ago...

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.270
in the Village Hidden in the Mist a.k.a. Blood Mist Village,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.900
there was an extremely difficult obstacle in order to become Ninja.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.600
You even know about that graduation exam...?

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.030
That graduation exam?

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.330
What's that graduation exam?

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.870
Fellow students kill each other.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.270
Fellow comrades who all ate from the same bowl...

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.630
make teams of two and fight each other...

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.070
until one of them dies.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.030
Comrades who until that point would help each other,

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.070
talk about their dreams and compete with each other...

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.700
Looking at the flow of the picture book,

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.470
it appears you're defeating enemies...

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.700
and taking away their weapons and armor...

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.400
On the facing pages at the center...

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.300
you will end up fighting your older brother...

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.130
You killed your older brother-- No!

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.100
I was planning on giving this to him.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:07.570
But when I was just about finished with the picture book, he...

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.300
He...

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.070
died from sickness.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:24.030
What do you mean...you don't feel anything or have any emotions?

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.800
I mean just what I said.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.870
Even so...

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.070
If you have a brother, you should be able to imagine...

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.030
what it would be like to lose him, right?

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.900
Yeah, well...you could say that...

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.600
My brother's dead, after all.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.470
Then all the more...

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.870
I wonder if I should've looked like that.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.030
What're you trying to say?

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.600
Well... I didn't know what kind of look to make

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.100
when my brother died...

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.670
In The Foundation, there were many children of broken families...

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.100
brought about by battle.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.130
He was one of those children.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.500
I became close with him, like a brother.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.930
We weren't related by blood...

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.830
But he often said nice things about my drawings.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.370
In this picture book...

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.870
what I wanted to show him most of all...

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.100
was what were supposed to be the final pictures on the facing pages.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.130
But after he died...

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.470
I couldn't remember what I was going to draw.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.470
Unfortunately Sai...

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.900
I'll be having my clone stand guard over you here.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.800
All right!

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.330
Now it's back to square one...

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.670
We're going to save Sasuke!

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.470
I wouldn't bother.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.000
I...

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.970
met Sasuke.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.500
Sasuke always has Orochimaru with him.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.770
That is to say, you'll have to fight Orochimaru once again.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.930
You'll end up being chopped up into pieces...

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.970
and turned into a test subject if you pursue reckssly.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.070
And...

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.070
And what?!

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:25.030
Sasuke said he doesn't care about you...

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:31.270
Sakura said you think of Sasuke like a brother.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.400
And yet...

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.970
For a guy like that, why...?

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.770
Why are you trying to get him back...

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.830
going so far as to oppose Orochimaru and put your life at risk?

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.870
Why is that? When nobody's ordering you to do so?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.830
I used to really hate Sasuke.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.370
Even though, like me, he didn't have a family...

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.200
he was elite and I was always at the bottom.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:42.000
But it was actually fun being with him.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.370
He...

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.200
He's the person who acknowledged me...

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.070
more than anyone else.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.670
Sasuke...

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.870
is my friend.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.470
It's a special bond I was finally able to make.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.330
A bond.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.900
Even so...

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.100
Even so, with Orochimaru as your opponent...

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.470
It doesn't matter who the opponent is!

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.330
If my arms get torn off, I'll kick him down.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.430
If my legs get torn off, I'll bite him down.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.630
If my head gets torn off, I'll stare him down.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.070
If my eyes get torn out, I'll curse him in my grave!

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.030
Even if I get chopped up into pieces...

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.600
I'll take Sasuke back from Orochimaru!

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.330
Damn it, there are so many rooms!

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.500
Sasuke is back here somewhere...

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.130
Let's split up here and search for him.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.870
But Captain, what if we stir up a hornet's nest...?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.030
It'll be okay.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.870
The seeds will generally respond if you build up your Chakra,

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.600
so I should be able to rush on in.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:54.600
I get it.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:55.970
Roger!

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:01.030
Okay, we're ready, huh? Let's make our move. Move out!

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.130
Next time: "Something Important..."
