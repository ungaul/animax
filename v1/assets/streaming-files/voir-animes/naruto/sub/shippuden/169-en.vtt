WEBVTT

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.180
All right!

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.260
I'm going to start on the ecological survey!

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.340
Hey!

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.930
Hey wait!

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.930
Hey Octopops, I can't tell whether this one's a male or female.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.680
Its body's all curled up.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.260
This armadillo's always been shy.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.220
If you're trying to check its gender, I can see why.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.130
The chorus sings out about this super abnormality…

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.470
Because now we see a human's real pervert personality…

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.550
I have no choice!

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.220
This is a top-secret S-rank mission and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.220
I have to make the list for the Animal Unit!

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.680
And checking for gender is crucial!

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.340
Male, female, it don't matter.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.590
So just report that it's the latter.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.090
But! But!

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.430
The markings on the back read "Male."

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.930
That's just a pattern.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.220
I just have a bad feeling about this.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.090
Ask the armadillo will ya, old man?

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.470
You're the boss here, right?

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.260
Well?

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.010
It says its, "privates are private!"

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.300
Oh, is that right?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.470
Damn it! How can I do any research?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.430
This S-rank mission is living up to its rank…or is it?!

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.300
Male and female…

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.880
Some species can switch between both, yo!

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.680
But heaven and earth can never switch places, yo!

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.380
Fool, ya fool…

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.130
What?! Something is approaching at high speed!

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.970
And it's…not human!

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.300
What's the matter?

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.430
You took me by surprise.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.050
I had heard that you were dead, Deidara.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.300
I never expected your clay clones.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.090
So that was… …a stone clone of the Tsuchikage.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.340
We were thinking the same thing. Hmm!

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.470
Brother Deidara!

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.180
I thought you blew yourself up in a big way.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.430
Why are you still alive?

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.430
So you didn't die, after all?

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.180
Don't get excited, Akatsuchi!

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.430
It's Orochimaru's jutsu, called the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.630
It may seem as though he was brought back to life,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.800
but he's not real.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.840
Damn it. Still causing trouble, even in death!

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.300
A youngster from the Hidden Leaf beats you…

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.840
And then you have the gall to sneak back in amongst the living!

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.340
Shut up! I killed Sasuke Uchiha…hmm!

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.510
And now it's your turn, geezer, for mocking my art! Hmm!

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.380
Seems Deidara doesn't know anything.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.550
Enough! I'll capture you both!

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.630
Do you intend to get in our way?

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.510
I knew we would be ambushed.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.590
You didn't think we'd come unprepared, did you?

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.430
What do you mean?

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.340
Impossible! They've found out about this place already?

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.590
Th-There's no way…!

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.050
Motoi…

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.340
THE ARTIST RETURNS

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.930
Seems we found them.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.380
Sorry, but we have to go there.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.880
Why?

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.220
What? My body won't respond to me!

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.680
No way! Don't tell me he found them!

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.180
We're going after him, you two!

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.340
– Right! – Gotcha!

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.180
What's going on?

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.010
I used various drugs to activate the original Manda's cells

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.590
to create a Second Manda…

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.970
He surpasses the First Manda in size, power, and intellect!

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.430
The fact that the island is an animal and is mobile

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.760
turns out to be its fatal flaw.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.340
What is that?

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.260
An island?

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.470
What's that island supposed to be?

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.470
It's not an island.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.550
It's a giant turtle and it's moving.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.930
And that is where we'll find the Eight and Nine Tails.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.840
A turtle? The Eight and Nine Tails?

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.720
This is our chance to capture the Eight and Nine Tails!

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.510
I get it! So that damn Naruto is there! Hmm!

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.510
What's the plan?

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.180
In any case, we have to stop that turtle island.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.180
Deidara, give me a big one.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.180
Damn!

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.340
They're fast!

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.470
Let's go!

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.510
Right.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.510
Katsu!

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.510
Wood Style: Deep Forest Emergence!

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.470
It flipped over.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.300
It can't move now.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.880
Oww…

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.340
What happened?

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.720
Heaven and Earth really did trade places, yo.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.340
Fools, ya fool!

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.720
I knew it!

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.130
Even if Heaven and Earth flip over…

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.180
A male is still a male and…

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.010
This is no time to be doing an ecological survey!

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.550
Calm down, Yamato.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.510
Remember, this is an S-rank mission.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.550
Something must have happened outside.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.510
But we have to keep fooling him.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.590
We cannot allow those two to leave this place.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.550
We have to deal with it ourselves.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.340
Kabuto, you search for the Eight and Nine Tails. Hmm…

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.510
I'll handle those guys. I owe them nothing less.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.970
Fine, let's do that.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.430
Deidara!

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.930
You shall feel my wrath.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.050
Damn it, the geezer's snapped.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.590
You haven't forgotten, have you?

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.590
This is getting bad!

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.180
Don't tell me he's going right to his Particle Style?! Hmm!

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.590
Things are starting to get out of hand.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.760
I won't let you get away!

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.760
What are you doing, Akatsuchi?!

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.510
If you do that, you'll end up killing turtle island!

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.970
Damn!

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.510
This is complicated!

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.130
It's so large that it just looks like a landscape!

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.470
There's my chance! Hmm!

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.090
Katsu!

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.380
Old man!

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.090
Akatsuchi's Golem!

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.430
Still attached to the Tsuchikage I see…

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.430
What a nuisance! Hmm!

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.430
I should get him away from this island.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.180
That damn snake!

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.300
So that guy over there is the one controlling the snake!

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.300
The nerve of that wimp.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.260
He was just pretending to be Orochimaru's henchman!

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.340
I see… So Naruto is inside this turtle.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.470
Now then, how do I get in?

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.430
Damn it! What's going on outside?!

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.510
Th-There've been a lot of tremors today…

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.590
Y-You're right.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.930
Still, this is too weird.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.340
Can the world turn upside down?

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.010
Well, it seems to be possible on this island.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.630
Although it's an extremely rare event.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.430
Oh really?

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.430
I think I'm going to take a look outside!

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:39.430
No! You're on an important S-rank mission,

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.680
so stay focused!

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.720
Yeah, well…

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.050
I'm just going to take a quick look outside.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.680
It is a ninja's duty to see through his mission until completion!

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:56.010
And this is a mission only you can accomplish!

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.680
That's why you were selected.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.510
Do you understand, Naruto?

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.760
We will see what's going on outside.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.880
That's about the only way we can contribute here.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.510
However, let me repeat.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.510
You are on a crucial S-rank mission!

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.090
Even Naruto is beginning to sense something.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.880
We bluffed him into thinking this is an S-rank mission.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.050
But basically, he's just checking to see

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.970
if an animal has balls or not.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.840
Naruto's not an idiot.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.550
He might have already figured it out.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.180
Okay, I understand!

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.050
I'm going to focus on my mission!

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.050
All right! This is going work out!

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.800
Thank goodness he's so dense!

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.090
You're too slow!

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.430
Corrosion Style: Quicklime Jutsu!

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.510
There they are.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.260
Is that him?!

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.010
There should be five humans!

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.340
So Aoba is here too.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.590
Don't come crawling out!

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.760
Didn't we say that we'd take care of this?

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.260
Having said that…

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.550
You're the Tsuchikage's granddaughter…

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:30.430
Perfect timing. You can take me to Naruto.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:34.930
A snake…

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.010
And that voice. Don't tell me you're…

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.380
We meet again, Yamato.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.720
I'll sweep him your way!

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.880
So get him!

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.300
Water Style: Water Trumpet!

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.340
Nice!

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.720
No good! He had it figured out!

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.970
I told you guys to get him, but…

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.380
I got him!

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.010
This is…

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.720
I see…

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.590
Idiot! Now you can't move!

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.220
My Quicklime Jutsu is like fast-acting cement.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.430
I spread it around an area with water…

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.840
making it cause a reaction that makes it harden like cement.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.340
Motoi, Aoba!

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.340
Don't step into that water.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.970
That's for extra insurance!

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.510
All right! You're ours!

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.630
I'll extract intel out of you!

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.510
The geezer is faster than he was in his prime!

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.340
You've always snuck around and fought from a distance.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.300
I never liked that about you!

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.050
Shut up!

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.300
I'll finish him off with my C4… Hmm!

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.300
They're too fast! I can't keep up!

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.630
Kabuto, how you've fallen.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.470
You've become just like Orochimaru.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.180
Never mind me. Just make sure you don't fall off!

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.300
Aoba, concentrate!

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.130
Yeah, I know. I'm okay.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.470
You know that I'm in the Intel Division, don't you?

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.470
I'm going to take a look and see everything that's happened to you.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.380
He's molted?!

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.130
He's gone that far?

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.430
Motoi, get away!

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.090
Yamato!

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.340
Damn it!

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.470
Lucky for me, Kurotsuchi, I knew the hand signs for your jutsu.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.510
I was able to put you all off guard.

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.510
Are you saying that you waited for this moment?

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.380
Damn!

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.430
Corrosion Style: Quicklime Jutsu!

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.880
Wait!

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.180
Damn! He hid inside the nose!

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.680
This should be high enough.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.180
Don't underestimate me, old geezer!

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.800
Prepare to die, Deidara!

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.430
Let's see which one is real art,

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.300
your Particle Style or my Explosion Style!

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:17.630
This is—?!

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.090
What?!

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.800
Right when we were getting to the good part! Hmm!

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.340
Damn!

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.130
I can't move!

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.510
Hold on!

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.380
When the kid from Hidden Rock returns, she'll free you!

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.930
You're…Lord Tsuchikage!

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.970
Deidara got away. What about you guys?

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.880
Someone from the Hidden Rock went after him.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:49.050
Please help me! I'll go after them!

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.590
Which way did Kabuto go?

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.340
I can't sense the enemy anymore.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.380
I can't tell which direction… It's useless.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.720
Damn it. Yamato's been…

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.880
What happened?

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.220
The Wood Style user, the Nine Tails' guardian,

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.840
Yamato has been taken.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.720
He didn't bother going after the Eight or Nine Tails.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.090
We don't know if he wanted a hostage to interrogate…

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.300
or if the Wood User himself was the target.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.630
But the problem is the intel that can be gleaned from Yamato!

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.380
Yamato would never break down to reveal intel that easily!

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.680
That's not what I meant.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.050
If our foe is Madara, he will have formidable visual prowess.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.260
Once someone is caught under his visual prowess,

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.510
there's no breaking away.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.090
This present you brought is very different from what I expected.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.300
You're right.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.130
But he is the Nine Tails' guardian

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.760
and he also possesses highly classified intel.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.470
Furthermore, I can use him

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.590
to make Zetsu and the others much stronger.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.050
Instead of pushing my luck,

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.380
I decided to settle by just capturing him.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.010
This works out better for you guys.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.380
Then hurry up and do it.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:28.130
This left eye of mine is itching to battle.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.510
Convene the commando unit immediately!

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.300
Have the main regiment run through their formations!

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.430
Make sure the medical units are well supplied

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.680
with medical ninja tools!

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.680
Contact Ao and the Sensory unit. Have them hurry!

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.340
Tsuchikage, these were finished while you were away.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.720
Take it.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.720
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Assemble! Allied Shinobi Forces!"

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.340
ASSEMBLE! ALLIED SHINOBI FORCES! Headbands for the Allied Shinobi Forces eh? Nice work!

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.260
ROCK LEE'S SILLY CHRONICLES PART 4

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.300
To shine bright is youth, Lee!

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.970
I understand, Guy Sensei!

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.430
But how can I shine even brighter?

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:46.680
Oh, I know!

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.220
Guy Sensei, I'm even more shiny today!

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.510
Yes, your hair is so shiny!

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.800
But this is just superficial brightness!

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.220
This is true brightness!

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.680
Whoa! That's just too dazzling!

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.430
I can make eggs sunny-side up too!

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.010
It's so good!

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.050
You guys want some?

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.680
– No thanks! – No thanks!

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.220
Tune in again
