WEBVTT

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.570
The Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.280
I-Is that...?!

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.280
That's the...!

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.150
There's no mistaking it.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.440
Yeah…

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.280
That's…

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.980
The Ten Tails!

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.940
But I thought the Statue's evil chakra had disappeared!

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.730
Damn it! They got us!

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.150
That thing doesn't have that kind of emotion of feeling!

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.150
It can't be sensed.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.610
It's Natural Energy itself.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.150
It's the same as that which circulates around the world,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.900
that you can feel in the soil, water, and the air.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.780
It would be a different story if you tried it

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.150
while engaged in Sage Mode though.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.940
Got it!

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.860
So if you say he's all Nature Energy,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.230
then I can check him out!

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.150
Forget it, Naruto…

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.280
Even if you tried something like that…

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.730
All you'll see is just how immeasurable it is.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.530
You're not kidding.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.530
I had planned to capture them before the Ten Tails revived, but...

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.570
They're pretty good.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.070
I want to start the Infinite Tsukuyomi ritual immediately.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.190
That Great Genjutsu requires time to summon the moon.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.280
They will interfere with the jutsu.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.150
Things will go more smoothly

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.610
if we use the Statue's power to get rid of them first.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.150
Don't you agree?

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.150
Madara…

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.530
You just want to test the Ten Tails' power, don't you?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.480
That's why you deliberately...

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.860
You're like a child.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.360
No.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.480
Brats are impatient, touchy fools.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.820
Hey… Here comes a big one.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.780
You think we can really do this?

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.320
Don't think you can hide under your tentacles

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.110
'cuz you're scared!

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.070
But first, hand me Guy over there.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.570
I'll heal him later.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.690
And that Naruto and Kakashi too!

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.820
Yeah!
Here you go!

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.690
Listen up.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.280
First, we keep our distance and see what move he makes!

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.690
Then we'll counter the attack

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.440
and hit him with a big blow as close as we can get.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.070
Just like I said earlier!

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.780
Nine Tails, you're acting like a captain.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280
Huh? You got a problem with that?!

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.230
Nope… In fact, I feel kind of happy!

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.360
That line...

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.730
Save it for after we've won!

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.530
Let's go!

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.530
It's surprisingly fast…

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.150
There wasn't any time to observe its moves!

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.320
Damn it!

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.480
Now! Eight-O!

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.690
Tailed Beast... Bomb Barrage!

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.610
There's no need to dodge.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.360
I want to preserve Ten Tails' power as much as possible.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.230
This is…

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.480
…not good!

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.570
It's all on you now!

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.230
Persistent lot!

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.230
Hey, Naruto, don't tell me...

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.110
Don't worry Bushier Brow Sensei.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.480
Nice control, Naruto!

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.110
You got them in nice and close!

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.980
We focused too much on Ten Tails.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.320
Sorry about the one leg.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.030
But here we go!

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.400
Kamui!

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.150
Yeah!

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.030
It just looks like one octopus leg got left behind, but...

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.280
Bee! Eight Tails!

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.190
Operation Octopus Pot! Sorry it's a mean and cowardly plot!

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.150
I'm gonna smash this into his eyeball!

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.280
Get him!

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.650
Huh?!

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.280
There are two flies above us as well…

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.730
The Ten Tails' tail?!

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.230
Naruto!

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.320
Kakashi!

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.230
Naruto, you really are a lot like me.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.190
That's right, you're just younger than me.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.440
Eventually…

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.530
Forgive me, Eight-O and Octopops!

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.690
Another Shadow Clone, huh?

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.360
Kurama!

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.400
How can you fall apart at a time like this?!

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.230
That was about eight minutes.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.940
It's longer than before, but that's the limit.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.230
I'm going to have to infuse and build up my chakra.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.070
Guess we have no choice.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.070
That hurts, fool. Ya fool!

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.940
Bee!

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.280
I'm going to rest a bit too. I'm also at my limit.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.440
I can't get healed yet?

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.030
Pulling something as massive as Eight Tails in and out

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.780
sure comes with a correspondingly large cost.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.230
I'm drained already.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.320
Seems Eight Tails and Nine Tails have run out of chakra for now.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.150
You favorite Shadow Clone Jutsu?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.400
It may be forbidden high-level ninjutsu,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.650
but just increasing the number of losers won't--

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.190
I'm not a loser!

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.320
Stop, Naruto!

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.150
It's meaningless to create Shadow Clones

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.610
that will divide your chakra even more.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.150
They might be useful as diversions, but not for decisive hits.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.980
And if you go down...

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.190
we lose this war.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.280
You were always just a motley crew anyway.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.320
Huh?!

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.480
M-M-Motley crew?

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.820
Like I said, you're incompetent.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.110
He's saying that it's pointless to merely increase the number of heads...

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.320
if they're all empty.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.980
You and I are both powerless shinobi.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.190
You...

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.690
no, I should say everyone…

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.440
will eventually end up like me.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.280
I'll never end up like you!

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.360
How many times do I have to tell you?!

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.900
My dream is to become the Hokage!

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.110
Don't worry.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.320
Everything will go as planned.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.320
There is no shinobi jutsu mightier than the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.980
I'll make you Hokage inside this jutsu.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.650
So…

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.440
Just disappear along with the rest of this world!

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.320
What the…?

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.280
Did it miss? On purpose?

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.030
About time!

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.440
Kakashi! Guy!

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.900
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.150
I can't believe he shook off

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.280
my Byakugan-aided, spot-on Mind Transfer in just two seconds!

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.650
But you still succeeded in shifting that large thing's aim off target.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.780
Good work!

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.780
Are you all right, Naruto?

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.570
Yeah!

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.690
You don't have to act tough in front of Hinata, Naruto!

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.360
Beetle Jamming Jutsu!

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.070
Hidden Mist Jutsu!

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.650
We're here, Naruto!

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.280
All right, we won't be so easily detectable now!

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.980
Lord Bee! You're in better shape than I expected!

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.440
Lord Bee! You look seriously wounded!

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.900
Omoi, you worry too much!

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.980
Guy Sensei, don't tell me you used Hirudora?!

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.650
Lee!

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.030
I'm sorry we're late, Captain Kakashi.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.690
Sakura, first off...!

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:28.860
I know!

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.400
The Sensory Water Sphere won't maintain its original shape.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.320
We better...!

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.150
Inoichi! Ao! Confirm the situation!

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.940
- Roger! - Okay!

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.030
First Company has arrived!

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.480
Second Company has also arrived!

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.780
Third Company has arrived!

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.030
Fourth Company has arrived!

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.360
Fifth Company has also arrived!

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.030
The Medical Unit's here too!

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.780
Sensory Unit has arrived!

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.650
Nice try hiding, but...

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.900
Wind Style!

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.480
Art of the Gust Blade!

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.230
We're not a motley crew anymore!

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.070
Here is the Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu!

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.690
The world's greatest, most invincible, super-duper ninjutsu, you know!

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.610
A jutsu that trumps the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Remember that!

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.070
The Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu, eh?

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.030
Don't you think that's a bit of stretch?

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.860
We're going to stop you two with this jutsu!

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.320
You're wrong.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.190
Why won't you realize that it's meaningless for you to stop us here?

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.860
After this war, even that jutsu will disintegrate…

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.570
Then someone from your side will attempt to do

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.400
exactly what we're doing now.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.070
There is no victory, no matter how much you struggle.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.320
Get it through your head.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.900
There's no such thing as hope anywhere in this world.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.980
I don't care!

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.320
I'll make sure there's hope!

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.780
It's meaningless to argue

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.530
whether there is or isn't something during a war.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.610
How about we settle this now?

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:41.070
When there's a difference of opinion, isn't the usual way majority rule?

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.610
So what do we do?

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.980
That's a good suggestion.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.190
Then…

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.860
We'll call it after we've erased all of you

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.690
And...

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.480
I knew you'd say that.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.030
But…

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.070
This world…

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.820
- will end! - will not end!

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.190
Let's go, everyone!

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.820
This is the final deciding battle!

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.320
Scatter!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.900
Thanks for buying us some time, Naruto.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.730
Did you have enough time to come up with a strategy?

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.900
Thanks to you, I was able to relay it to everyone!

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.780
Kakashi told us the masked man is Obito Uchiha.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.280
But there's no time to be shocked.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.900
For this fight, we need to take and maintain the upper hand

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.820
and not give them any opportunity to counter!

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.110
According to the intel we received, our enemy has impressive eyes.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:49.610
First, we'll impede their movement by destroying their vision.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.610
The Hidden Cloud!

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.110
Lightning Style!

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.070
Flash Pillar!

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.190
Gale Style! Laser Circus.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.030
I see…

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.690
Their true aim is to blind Ten Tails!

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.900
With the two jutsu from earlier,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.150
the Hidden Mist's Mist and the Beetle Jamming...

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.190
Along with the large volume of airborne dust

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.900
stirred up by the Gale Style right now...

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.860
The Hidden Sand, now!

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.280
Wind Style: Air Current Dance!

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.820
We'll not just destroy their vision completely,

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.940
but thwart them from even sensing us at all.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.690
And since their sheer bulk prevents them from hiding...

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.860
we'll be able to take full advantage of the situation.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.190
We only revealed our jutsu to him a short while ago,

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.030
and he's already incorporating them into the battle plan!

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.570
Leave it to Shikamaru's dad, like father like son!

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.480
This makes it impossible to sense them.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.360
We'll wipe them all out with a Ten Tails' attack!

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.440
The Hidden Stone, proceed immediately!

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.940
We know!

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.320
Earth Style: Vast Mobile Core!

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.650
After shutting down their senses, we'll immobilize them!

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.480
As soon as we bring down the Ten Tails, pour in quicklime!

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.230
- Lava Style: Quicklime Jutsu! - Lava Style: Quicklime Jutsu!

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.980
Hidden Mist! You're up next!

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.360
- Water Style: Water Bomb Jutsu! - Water Style: Water Bomb Jutsu!

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.070
We'll add water to the mix,

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.980
and rapidly stir up the quicklime!

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.900
Hidden Leaf! Let's finish this!

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.360
Sarutobi Clan members!

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.570
Let's go!

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.980
Fire Style: Majestic Flame Jutsu!

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.360
And we'll dry it with the heat from the Fire Style…

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.530
Let it set and immobilize it!

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.190
Unbelievable.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.110
Who would've thought,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.230
that the ninja from the five villages could work so cooperatively.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.780
Unless we stop the Ten Tails,

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.030
we don't have a chance to go after Obito or Madara.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.400
The Ten Tails is merely a tool for them to aid in activating their jutsu.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.230
If we cut off the head from the body, namely those two…

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.940
Infinite Tsukuyomi cannot be activated!

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.980
But keep in mind that we won't be able to suppress

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.110
the Ten Tails' power for too long.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.280
Only physical attacks work on Madara.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.320
So shinobi who are skilled in taijutsu will go after Madara!

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.940
Obito can slip through all moves and jutsu,

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.110
but according to our intel, that only lasts for five minutes.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.150
Coordinate with the Medical Unit and

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.400
keep attacking him for more than five minutes!

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.320
Do not let up!

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.650
That's right, Naruto... It's now time for your...

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.610
Allied Shinobi Forces Jutsu!

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.110
How pitiful.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.570
Yeah.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.150
This hope that they're clinging to doesn't exist.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:54.110
Just like their very lives, at this point.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.400
It seems Ten Tails...is ready.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.480
Don't just stand there spacing out, Naruto!

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.400
This is a battlefield and we're at war.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.690
People die!

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.610
Naruto, your power is critical to the plan.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.530
You are the key!

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:54.190
So until we execute it... We must protect you, Naruto!

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.320
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Ties That Bind"

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.900
The Hyuga are the mightiest among The Hidden Leaf!

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:09.650
THE TIES THAT BIND Tune in again!
