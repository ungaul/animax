WEBVTT

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.280
You're finally going out.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.280
Well, there have been a lot of changes to our plans.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.280
I wish you wouldn't say it like I'm to blame.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.120
Thanks to you, we had to change our strategy.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.740
Thanks to me,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.490
your military strength and variations of attack increased, didn't they?

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.240
Don't do anything strange while I'm away.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.780
We're comrades. You should trust me more.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.200
You only look after your own interests.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.740
You won't even tell me where you're off to?

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.410
The Hidden Rain Village.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.660
The Hidden Rain?

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.450
They're not even directly involved in the Great Ninja War,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.910
so why are you going now?

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.330
It doesn't concern you.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.240
Wait, Yahiko!

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.410
Wait!

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.490
I'm first!

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.660
It's a toad, a toad! A giant toad!

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.950
How'd it get inside our hideout?

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.910
What'll we do?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.660
You're so noisy! What's all this ruckus about?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.910
Jiraiya Sensei?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.870
Well? Does it look good on me?

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.740
Now that you mention it, I guess so…

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.280
What's so funny?

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.450
It's not funny!

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.530
The Angelic Herald of Death

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.700
Looking for something?

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.330
Yeah.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.740
Where did you put Nagato's corpse?

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.410
You won't find him here.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.370
The Rinnegan…

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.030
It seems you aren't going to cooperate

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.950
and tell me where you hid Nagato.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.280
I knew that you would appear before me.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.080
I've been waiting for you.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.490
So I could stop you.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.990
Just because you used to be a comrade

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.490
does not mean I'll show you any mercy.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.030
The Akatsuki does not put up with traitors.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.780
Understand?

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.830
I have one question.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.740
Why would such loyal members as you both betray me?

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.160
You and Nagato both approved of my Project Tsuki no Me.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.450
If you lost to Naruto Uzumaki,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.830
then it couldn't have been helped.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.280
But…Nagato sacrificed his life,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.160
using the Rinne Rebirth Jutsu, for Naruto's sake.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.330
That jutsu was to be used for my sake.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.200
I never imagined that Pain would be defeated.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.200
We must notify Tobi. Let's go.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.330
But even Zetsu did not see what made Nagato change his mind.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.620
I have told you my story.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.120
Now let me hear your answer.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.580
TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.330
But I have faith that there will come a time

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.330
when people can truly understand one another.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.870
I get where you're coming from now.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.700
But I still…

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.910
can't forgive you.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.410
I still hate you.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.240
Do you want to settle this, then?

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.740
But…

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.370
Pervy Sage believed in me, and left me his quest.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.370
So I'm going to believe in Pervy Sage's belief.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.830
That's my answer.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.530
Don't play with me!

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.740
It's far too late for me to believe Jiraiya's words!

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.660
There's no such thing as true peace!

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.120
As long as we live in this cursed world,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.990
peace is impossible!

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.660
Then…

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.080
Then…I'll break that curse.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.490
If there is such a thing as peace, I'll seize it!

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.450
I'll never give up!

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.200
You…

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.530
That's…

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.160
Nagato? What's wrong?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.280
Those…words…

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.330
That's right.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.370
They're taken straight from this book.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.490
The first novel written by Pervy Sage.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.990
Pervy Sage was seriously trying

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.530
TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA to change the world with this.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.240
At the end of this book, he wrote about a student who helped

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.910
JIRAIYA provide him with inspiration.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.450
It was you, Nagato.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:43.530
No…

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.450
TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA And…

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.830
the name of the hero in this novel…

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.120
is Naruto!

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.620
My name is a precious memento from Pervy Sage!

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.240
I can't just give up and stain the memento from my master!

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.870
I will be the Hokage!

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.620
And I will bring peace to the Hidden Rain!

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.080
Please believe in me!

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.450
How?

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.240
How can you say that you will never change?

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.410
That you will not change,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.240
no matter how great the pain you face.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.370
Can you continue believing in yourself?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.160
Can you guarantee it?

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.700
Can you have such faith in yourself?!

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.330
And there's a lot of pain nesting inside of me as well.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.910
There's no telling what kind of pain will come after me.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.240
But…

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.030
TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA If I stop believing because of that…

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.160
TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA If the hero should change,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.200
it'll turn into another story.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.200
from the one my master left behind.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.450
Then it won't be Naruto!

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.870
I can't write novels like my master did.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:38.700
That's why the sequel has to come from the life I live.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.870
No matter how great the pain, I'll continue walking.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.950
Because that's who Naruto is!

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.740
Naruto Uzumaki… You think he's that worthy?

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.580
He is the light.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.530
That's why we all… can carry flowers of hope!

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.660
You bare your fangs at me,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.580
yet you still continue to wear that cloak.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.700
I see that you are still attached to the Akatsuki.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.660
Yahiko founded the Akatsuki.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.280
The red cloud on this cloak symbolizes the blood

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.080
that rained over the Hidden Rain from war!

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.620
You are just riding on its coattails.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.870
These cloaks are our legacy, not yours.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.660
Furthermore, Nagato, a shinobi of the Hidden Rain,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.740
awakened the Rinnegan.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.200
And that too, does not belong to you.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.120
His eyes are this nation's… this village's treasure!

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.160
You are mistaken on two points.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.080
It's all over for you anyway, so I will tell you.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.620
I am the one who encouraged Yahiko to establish the Akatsuki.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.740
And I was also the one who gave Nagato the Rinnegan.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.030
So it's only right for me to ask for it back.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.530
Well, no matter.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.160
As far as I'm concerned,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.370
you're just a girl who knows nothing.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.950
Except that, right now,

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.990
you know where Nagato's Rinnegan is.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.280
Once I capture you, I can do anything I want.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.160
Do not underestimate the visual prowess of the Uchiha, girl!

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.280
Using a manifold attack,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.950
she intends to find a chance to attack when I materialize.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.620
Fine. I know she has some strategy to tempt me.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.330
I accept her challenge!

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.280
Over here!

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.330
She mixed in Paper Bombs!

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.370
I will take you with me to the afterlife.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.330
We lost another member in the Seventh Ward.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.030
That place is turning into guerilla warzone.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.240
We'd better deal with it now.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.410
I'll go scout it out in the afternoon.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.030
Nagato, rest awhile.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.330
Don't overdo it.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.200
No, but… No buts. Rest.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.240
I will go.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.080
Be careful, Yahiko.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.870
You don't need to see me off!

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.080
See to Nagato's wound, will you?

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.870
From now on, save your worrying for him.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.950
Nagato is the keystone of the Akatsuki!

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.370
He will become the man

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.240
who changes this nation and this world!

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.580
The same can be said of you.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.280
Everyone respects and admires you.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.950
Nagato is no different.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.370
Nagato is going to be… the bridge to peace.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.200
My job is to be a pillar that supports that bridge.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.330
Yahiko.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.240
This nation continues to weep.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.580
It continues to endure pain.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.410
I used to hate this land that cries all the time.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.200
But now, I want to save it.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.410
It's what I want with all my heart.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.530
It reminds me of the crybaby that I used to be

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.030
and I can't ignore it.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:04.330
Yahiko!

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.120
Be careful.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.370
He is the bridge to peace.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.410
His will itself is the bridge.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.280
Nagato…

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.410
We believe in Yahiko!

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.280
Let's go, everyone!

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:24.490
Right!

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:32.530
I will be a pillar that supports two bridges: Yahiko and Nagato!

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.030
I didn't take you seriously enough.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.780
I should have remembered that

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.990
you are a former member of the Akatsuki…

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.280
The moment I sucked you in,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.830
you intended to blow yourself up, and take me with you.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.030
However, you failed.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.450
I sucked in the explosion itself.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.410
I was faster, although I felt a little of the impact.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.330
And luckily, you were spared too.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.740
You should be grateful.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.200
Does this mean your secret strategy is over?

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.780
Madara, let me ask you one thing.

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:29.280
What is it?

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.490
Do you know why we betrayed you?

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.330
Do you know why we have faith in Naruto?

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.450
Well now… That's your problem.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.620
Besides, Naruto is just a naïve child

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.240
chasing after an immature dream.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.530
I can see if Nagato was swayed

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.030
by the thought of true peace and hope.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.410
But you too, Konan?

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.870
I realized something after meeting Naruto.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.950
You're taking this one with you too?

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:11.280
Yes, Tendo Pain was created from Yahiko's body.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.370
He is very precious to us.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.580
So he was…Yahiko?

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.200
So what are you going to do?

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.240
I hate to think you're returning to the Akatsuki.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.410
I'm leaving the Akatsuki.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.370
Yahiko and Nagato meant everything to me.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.330
Yahiko's dream… and Nagato's dream…

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.200
If both of their dreams have been passed on to you,

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.370
you now embody their dreams.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.030
Nagato put his faith in you.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.990
So will I.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:01.450
We, the Hidden Rain, will pursue both their dreams with you.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:14.280
The name Naruto, the guts to never give up, and pain.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.450
That's what I inherited from my master and fellow disciple!

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.200
This time…

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.450
I pray that you will be the blossom of hope that never wilts.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.240
You are darkness.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.620
Flowers can only wilt in a world without light!

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:10.200
They both fought and died following their beliefs.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.830
Nagato is the one who will become the bridge to peace.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:16.660
Yahiko's will itself is the bridge to peace.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.660
Their will shall not be extinguished!

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.780
If there is such a thing as peace, I'll seize it!

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.410
Naruto Uzumaki will be the one to carry on their will!

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.240
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Bridge to Peace"

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.740
I shall be the pillar that supports him! THE BRIDGE TO PEACE

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.780
THE BRIDGE TO PEACE

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.740
ROCK LEE'S SILLY CHRONICLES PART 1

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.910
Lead…lead…lead…

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.280
That guy… He thinks he's so hot.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.780
I'm totally going to steal a base.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.490
Lead…lead…lead…

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.330
Did you call me, Naruto?

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.950
I wasn't calling you!

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.700
Out!

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:58.280
Huh?!

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.530
Did I do something wrong?

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.700
Tune in again!
