WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.980
The minute Sasuke returned to the village,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.610
people stopped paying attention to you.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.270
How trivial.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.940
Do you think something like that would bother me?

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.770
You might consider yourself a member of Team 7,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.980
but I wonder what they think?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.270
Do you really think I'd fall for your cheap persuasions?

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.690
I'm…

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.320
Dark Clouds

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.820
That's the inn that Lord Sai last stopped by…

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.110
Yeah.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.280
Also, look slightly above it.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.360
That's the only checkpoint leading into the village of Tobari.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.490
Unless we get past it, we can't get to the village.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.690
Sure, but is this get-up, like, really necessary?

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.110
It looks very becoming on you, Soku.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.110
Look, I had to bend over backwards to get a coal vendor's traveling permit.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.740
If you have any better ideas on getting past the checkpoint, let me know.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.940
We can humbly guarantee that

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.440
we will be able to deceive the enemy's eyes with this.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.240
Like, if we kill all of the lookouts,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.740
it will be easy to pass through the checkpoint!

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.940
It would spell trouble if we do that

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.610
and they found out the Leaf's involved.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.070
Besides, Sai's entire team was killed around here.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.490
Don't underestimate the enemy.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.990
If we linger too long,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.990
we'll only, like, up the chances of the enemy noticing us.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.530
Both of you, listen up.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.240
Look, I think it's crucial that we trust each other.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.530
And trust first begins with having faith in your partner.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.440
Did you get that out of, like, some weird book?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.990
Lord Shikamaru is doing his utmost to act like our leader.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.030
Quit trying to analyze me!

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.690
Anyway! This mission requires teamwork—

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.740
Huh?!

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.400
What's the big idea?!

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.070
Like, take a good look.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.940
Land of Silence shinobi?!

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.690
Soku!

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.570
Don't take action by yourself!

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.900
I'm better at, like, this sort of thing!

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.570
I did it!

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.860
Hey, c'mon.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.240
You just ruined our disguise.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.320
This has turned out to be a problematic occurrence.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.570
Well… I guess it's back to square one for our strategy.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.690
What'll you have?

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.490
Can I have a water?

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.400
You can have all you want.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.610
Anyway…

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.940
I heard the checkpoint to Tobari is around here.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.860
I've got nothing to say to outsiders.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.690
KNIGHT

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.570
The "demon killer"?

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.240
Oh…You know the game?

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.940
May I sit in?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.740
What luck finding an opponent in these parts.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.990
A welcome sight indeed.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.360
Are you traveling alone?

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.490
I've come to the village of Tobari to request shinobi assistance.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.990
But they're checking my background and what not,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.940
so, I've had to wait, as you can see.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.650
The Village of Tobari?

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.150
I've been wanting to do some business there.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.400
Going in and out of there is such hassle.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.990
PASSAGE Unless you have this pass, it's probably impossible.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.900
You got me!

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.940
Didn't expect that move!

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.030
PASSAGE Time's up…

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.070
By the way… Why did you choose the Land of Silence?

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.150
There are other lands that accept shinobi requests.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.740
Well, it's the price.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.860
After all, I don't mind who does the work itself,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.320
whether it's the Silence or the Hidden Leaf.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.650
After all, shinobi are merely appendages that you use,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.740
then discard.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.150
Please excuse me!

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.900
Are you trying to sabotage our strategy?

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.150
It's because we let guys like that say whatever they want that,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.940
like, shinobi are always looked down upon.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.490
That's no reason to kill him.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.570
I just wanted to shake him up a little.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.820
Like, you're the one who doesn't trust us.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.780
Then act with more caution.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.490
Got any complaints?

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.400
No way I'll mess up a mission by being, like, overcautious!

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.440
That girl…

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.690
Isn't she acting too rash?

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.190
More than anyone, Soku fears that peace in the land

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.070
will spell the end of a shinobi's existence.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.690
I presume she is determined to make this mission a success

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.860
to prove the value of shinobi to the world.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.320
So much blood was shed to achieve this long-sought peace.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.690
It's ridiculous that some people can't stomach it.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.900
Lord Shikamaru, you proved your mettle and worth as a shinobi

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.400
in the last Great Ninja War.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.360
But she's never had a chance to do so.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.860
Such is the sorrow of the generation that came too late.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.900
Ro, what about you?

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.240
You've experienced a lot, haven't you?

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.280
I simply escaped death, that is all.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.440
Everyone, do not move!

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.900
We're going to confirm your identity.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.320
You will not be allowed to leave the building!

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400
Hey!

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.990
What happened?

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.110
The shinobi in the ravine were, like, discovered.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.610
They move faster than I thought.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.190
Don't!

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.320
– We can't make a scene now. – I'm just waiting for my shogi partner!

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.860
– Then what do we do?! – Move!

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.820
– I'm thinking… – You two!

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.190
Over here!

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.860
How dare you!

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.690
What are you doing?

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.900
We owe our lives to you.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.610
No thanks necessary.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.780
I hate those guys from Tobari.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.280
They're always so arrogant.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.780
I'm Komori. Nice to meet you.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.990
Uh, we're… Whoa!

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.320
You don't have to tell me.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.900
We all have a thing or two we keep hidden, eh?

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.740
Komori, we want to go to the Village of Tobari.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.570
Do you know of a way to get past the checkpoint?

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.860
Now that's a tough question to answer.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.440
But why do you want to go there?

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.280
We've got some minor business to take care of.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.860
Someone's here!

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.070
What? It's just a mouse.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.990
Don't scare me like that!

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.420
What don't you understand about waiting until we find a way

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.550
to get through the checkpoint?

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.550
Like, if we take our time, we'll lose the chance to kill Gengo!

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.090
It's too dangerous to go alone.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.170
You are not to act alone!

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.130
I just want to, like, prove my ability.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.630
And I won't be held back by stupid rules!

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.960
Grow up!

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.800
This isn't some kind of game!

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.550
What a drag.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.750
What?!

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.920
Maybe I'll have more freedom in the Land of Silence.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.460
You mustn't say such reckless things.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:30.750
Hey, you're not… getting any weird ideas, are you?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.590
Deserting the village is a serious crime.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.960
Rogue Ninja are hunted down to the ends of the earth

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.050
and are always punished to the harshest extent of shinobi law.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.800
You're aware of that, aren't you?

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.670
Lord Shikamaru, Soku isn't serious.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.250
Isn't that so?

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.960
Like I care!

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.920
Hey, we're not done here!

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.380
Oh?

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.960
In a bad mood?

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.630
Like, it's none of your business.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.250
I don't know what happened,

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.300
but it's over if you get discouraged.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.710
Look at me. I'm forced to do jobs like this…

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.300
But one day, I'm gonna have a huge inn of my own!

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.800
Like, no one asked you.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.710
That kid…

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I hope she knows what she's supposed to do here.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.300
There's no need to worry about Soku.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.050
I just wanted to, like, make my power useful.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.960
So, you were a shinobi.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.800
It's a secret.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.420
I-I know that!

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.920
Everyone in the village has gotten used to peace,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.050
and they're too timid.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.500
Like, at this rate,

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.460
I should have just gone to the Land of Silence.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.840
Surely, you're not going to desert your village?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.340
Isn't that a serious crime?

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.500
Like, yeah, I know that.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.840
I feel a little better after talking to you.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.840
I'm going back to the guys.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.670
I see… I'll come with you!

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.380
You don't have to.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.960
I'm used to getting scolded,

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.920
so I'm really good at apologizing!

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.630
Ro, you saw her eyes too, right?

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.090
You are overthinking this.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.960
If Soku is serious about deserting the village…

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.920
we have to silence her.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.210
Can you do it?

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.420
I'm asking you, would you be able to do it?

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.710
Desertion is a serious crime.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:50.960
If Soku is serious, I shall not falter.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.340
I knew it!

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.960
Like, they're not comrades or anything!

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.250
Wait!

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.670
Soku!

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.550
I don't have a place where I belong anymore.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.340
What if…

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.460
I told you that there's a safe route

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.050
to get to the checkpoint without being discovered?

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.380
Are you willing to risk it?

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.960
It's the long way, but if you follow the river,

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.920
you'll reach the checkpoint without being seen.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.550
Hey!

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.300
What are you doing here?

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:42.670
U-Uh… I was looking for the mouse that got away.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.920
Have you seen Soku?

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.090
I-I didn't see anything!

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.920
What is going on?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.800
Hey!

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.050
Look at me in the eye and answer me again!

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.960
Where did Soku go?

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.550
I'm tellin' you I don't know!

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.880
Don't tell me… Is she heading for the checkpoint?

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.460
Did she desert?

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.090
That's it, isn't it?

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.710
That's inconceivable!

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800
Soku would not desert the village!

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.380
To find out, we need to catch Soku and ask her directly.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.050
Stop!

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.000
Why you—! Who are you?!

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.130
I deserted my village!

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.500
I want my skills to be of use here, for this land!

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.210
If you interfere, you're dead!

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.840
A Rogue Ninja? A kid like you?

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:47.090
Like, age doesn't matter. Ability is everything.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.880
Well, at least you talk the talk!

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.210
You won't walk away with just a wound on your leg the next time.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.630
D-Don't take this the wrong way.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.340
We've had a lot of rats sniffing around lately.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.380
Just recently…

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.090
Yeah… It was ANBU from the Hidden Leaf.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.500
You intend on deserting your village at your age?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.880
I'm just sick of old-fashioned rules.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.300
Like, with my skills,

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.420
you won't regret making me one of you.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.250
Great! I like you!

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.000
Well, you certainly have an interesting technique.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.000
Two of my men who were on reconnaissance were just killed.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.800
Your technique inflicts the same kind of wound that killed them.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.420
I wonder why?

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.050
Would you care to explain?

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.000
Things aren't looking good for you…

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.380
are they, young lady?

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.420
She's okay.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.300
Komori?

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.090
Sorry I didn't say anything.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.090
I had to test you to make sure we could trust you.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.710
She killed our comrades.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.920
We can't trust her.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.920
They attacked out of nowhere, I had no choice.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.590
I had a fight with my partners,

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.800
and I've made up my mind to leave.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.840
Captain, I've watched her all this time.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.170
She really did split off from her group.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.550
But I can't just take your word for it.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.250
Like, if you don't believe me,

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.170
I don't mind if we fight it out, right here.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.380
We found you, Soku!

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.710
So, you were pulling the strings, all this time, Komori!

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.380
You were pretty quick.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.840
But take a good look around you.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.090
There's no way you can win!

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.000
Hey!

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.880
Even you understand the gravity of deserting a village, don't you?

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.090
Hand her over to us right now.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.840
If you interfere, I won't go easy on you!

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.090
Will you turn her over, or not?

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.000
Interesting…

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.880
This is your chance to prove that you're serious.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.840
I'll help you!

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.170
I don't need your help!

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.130
This is my problem!

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.880
Lord Shikamaru, I implore you to think it over!

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.000
Soku has her reasons.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.710
Don't be reckless!

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.630
Are you going to betray me too?

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.250
Y-You misunderstand!

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.210
Then you're…first!

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.050
Lord…Shikamaru!

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.090
You two…together—!

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.090
Soku… You didn't...

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.590
You did well!

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.340
I don't sense any chakra. He's dead.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.550
You did it, Soku!

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.550
You'll be quite useful. Come.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.090
You're one of us now.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.840
You'll have to go through some rounds of questioning,

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.920
but you'll be released right away.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.920
In exchange for the intel that you possess—

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.590
I'm gonna have you, like, sleep for a while.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.380
Damn it, that was rough!

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.800
It went quite well.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.920
Soku said she'll make it seem like we're dead.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.920
But that hurt a lot.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.590
We owe that young boy some thanks too.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.750
What? It's just a mouse.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:56.130
Earlier, I used chakra to fake a shinobi's presence.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.170
And his unexpected reaction was our lucky break.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.050
An ordinary kid wouldn't have reacted to chakra like he did.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.420
And he performed unerringly as we predicted.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.920
But what Soku bemoaned…

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.050
She meant half of what she said.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.250
If she had been really serious,

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.000
she could have killed us both at any time.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.550
Were you not aware of that risk?

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.130
This thing about trust…

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.920
You have to have faith in your partner first.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.750
Isn't that what I said before?

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.800
As I'd expected of you.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.000
But don't tell Soku. Or it will just go to her head.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.670
Like, I just heard everything.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.750
Your logic's pretty naive, Shikamaru.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.170
What do you mean?

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.960
Don't tell me you really meant to hurt me?

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.880
Like, I can try again.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.300
Maybe next time.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.300
Anyway, how's it going?

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.210
I kept the lock open.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.210
As long as you return quickly, no one will notice.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.300
Perfect.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.050
Regarding Gengo, we have, like, nothing.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.590
And no one knows anything about the inside of the castle.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:49.420
It seems the man known as Gengo rarely appears before others.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.340
Anything on Sai?

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.090
Well, we've got, like, nothing on that either.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.500
Well, it seems this Gengo is a very cautious man.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.250
Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.380
"Shikamaru's Story, A Cloud Drifting in the Silent Dark, Part 3: Recklessness"

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.050
We're gonna expose this guy for what he really is!

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:28.920
Tune in again!
