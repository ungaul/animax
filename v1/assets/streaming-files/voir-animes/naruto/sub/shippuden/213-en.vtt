WEBVTT

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.980
I had nothing…

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.940
This is still not enough…

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.030
This is still not me!

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.730
That's why… I've kept adding onto myself.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.730
That's why I don't need your lectures.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.190
I need your abilities and intel.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.900
Not only are you a Leaf Shinobi,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.320
you're of the famed Uchiha bloodline.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.400
You possess the Sharingan that has awakened the Mangekyo…

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.900
You bore many secrets and stopped a war…

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.610
You had many jutsu and much power.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.560
Itachi, you possessed many things that made you who you are.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.030
There is no finer Reanimation out there of mine than you.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.440
And my pawns are part of my power!

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.030
You exaggerate…

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.940
The reality is, I failed.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.530
No, even though I mocked the Uchiha name in front of you earlier,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.190
I'm still quite envious of that name.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.280
The Uchiha name merely identifies one's bloodline

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.860
and clan membership.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.480
So it's meaningless for you to claim it.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.780
I was nobody.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.940
I had nothing.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.980
I bet he's from that city…

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.320
where that recent battle was!

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.360
Where are your parents?

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.820
Don't worry.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.230
I may not look it, but I know some Medical Ninjutsu.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.320
How about…Kabuto?

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.230
Sounds simple.
That was quick.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.480
You called it by just how he looks.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.070
It's best not to overthink things.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.230
Until I was given a name… and a place to call home…

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.730
Claiming a name is meaningless?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.440
No… It does hold meaning.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.780
Are you sure we can't kill him?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.780
We're stuck playing catch-up!

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.730
I told you no!

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.780
He controls the battlefield right now.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.940
Be patient.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.940
Is the Izanami still not ready?

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.570
He's about to come after us!

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.780
I'm already on him.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.610
It's just going to take a little more time.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.900
Lord Orochimaru said thusly…

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.030
Sakon! Demon Twin Jutsu!

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.860
Jirobo! Earth Style: Terra Shield!

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.570
"If you want to know who and what you are,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.690
"all you need to do is gather every single thing

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.980
"and piece of information that exists in this world!"

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.110
Kidomaru!

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.610
Spiral Web!

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.690
These threads can't be cut with a blade!

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.070
– Amaterasu! – Amaterasu!

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.820
Kimimaro!

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.820
Macabre Bone Pulse! Bracken Dance!

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.860
He's laid down the spider silk all the way to the back.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.320
I'll get the one behind us! Take the front, Brother!

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.030
Can you still use the Susano'o?

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.900
Yeah.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.900
Inferno Style! Flame Control!

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.280
Running away to the back?

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.530
Well, it's no use!

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.070
Tayuya! Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.730
Are you okay, Sasu—?!

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.400
A genjutsu, huh?

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.070
Even your specialty, Susano'o, cannot stifle sound…

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.570
I knew it…

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.110
Now you're immobilized.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.650
All that's left is…

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.360
to take you into me using Lord Orochimaru!

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.690
The Izanami Activated

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.530
Well, Sasuke…

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.480
Do you recognize this current form of mine?

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.150
That's…!

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.780
Thanks to you, I was finally able to take

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.110
Lord Orochimaru into my body after you killed him!

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.190
Yes, this is my true form…

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.400
Remember, I said that all the laws and principles of Nature,

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.650
which Lord Orochimaru researched and compiled for so long…

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.280
are now stored and being used inside of me.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.650
The only thing that was missing… was Lord Orochimaru himself!

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.780
Now, I have him inside me!

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.190
I can't thank you enough, Sasuke!

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.650
Kabuto… You are not Orochimaru.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.780
It's fine to imitate someone you respect…

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.190
But don't remake yourself into him, to that extent.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.940
The majority of people start out by mimicking someone.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.940
Like how Sasuke mimicked you.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.360
Wow, Brother!

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.780
You nailed every target,

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.530
even the one in the blind spot behind the rock!

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.110
All right, my turn!

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.360
Sasuke!

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.900
It's time to go.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.940
You said that you would teach me a new shuriken jutsu.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.900
I have an important mission tomorrow that I must prepare for.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.610
You're a liar…

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.900
Sorry, Sasuke.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.110
– Maybe some other time. – Ow!

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.280
Big Brother, watch this!

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.900
Hey!

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.070
Don't be reckless…

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.320
Keep at it and become great like your brother.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.150
Father… I…

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.900
I wanted you to say that you were proud of me.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.360
Such behavior is merely a process to help one mature!

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.780
Don't use it as a cloak to deceive yourself,

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.150
like you've done!

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.860
You gain nothing when you attach your self-value

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.400
to something external that's admirable and praiseworthy to you.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.030
I'll say this one last time.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.400
Don't mislead yourself with lies.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.730
Those who cannot acknowledge themselves will invariably fail.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.650
Fail? The way I am now?

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.070
How?!

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.610
Sasuke… Look into my eyes!

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.820
I understand!

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.690
Genjutsu… Sharingan!

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:20.780
Tsukuyomi!

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.530
I shall now engage the Izanami.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.480
You have already…failed.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.030
Is it over?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.530
A genius that had everything would never understand…

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.860
I just want to be who and what I am!

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.190
I won't let anyone stop me.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.780
Sa…suke…

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.070
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.690
Water Style: Giant Waterfall!

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.480
The same moves.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.820
As expected… It makes it easy for me to counter.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.070
I already told you that as long as I have my power of recovery,

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.480
wounding me is meaningless.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.860
Since I shut off my vision, genjutsu won't work on me.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.480
You have no chance of winning.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.110
Your fate is already in my hands.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.530
Thanks to the Uchiha's other Forbidden Jutsu.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.110
That is…

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.940
Well then… Shall we put that to the test?!

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.900
…the Izanami!

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.320
Sasuke, do not leave my side.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.360
Why this is just like déjà vu.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.900
I'm bored…

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.940
Let's end this fight already.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.030
Your fate may be in my hands now…

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.230
but you're the only one who can truly decide

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.730
how that fate shapes your destiny.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.190
Remember what I've told you.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.030
And think hard.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.030
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.320
Enough of your word games.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.400
I will have everything… I am the strongest of all!

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.110
That is fact!

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.280
He who forgives oneself, who can acknowledge one's true self…

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.190
is the most powerful of all!

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.940
Losers…

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.190
should be quiet!

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:26.980
This is…

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.530
What's…going on?

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.480
Why? That horn's already been cut off!

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.980
How? I have no sight…

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.320
I should be invulnerable to genjutsu.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.070
But this is clearly a…!

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.230
What did you do to me?!

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.030
You're in my Visual Jutsu.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.230
Impossible!

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.190
It's the Izanami!

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.690
How…?

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.030
No matter.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.780
No one can stop me!

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.030
There's nothing I can't do!

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.190
I told you…

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.070
I hold your fate in my hands.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.030
Itachi Uchiha!

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.530
If this is a genjutsu…

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.730
Release!

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.400
Calm down… This is an Uchiha Genjutsu.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.980
Moreover, Itachi cast it, so it won't be easy to undo.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.860
But there are many ways to undo a genjutsu!

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.690
It's useless.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:07.030
Recall my words to you.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.030
Sure! I'll copy the same trick you two used!

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.780
Tayuya! Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.940
This will switch from Itachi's control over genjutsu

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.530
to Tayuya's control.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:41.940
Then, I'll do this!

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.480
Sage Art… Inorganic Animation!

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.690
This area is under my control!

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.860
I'll retreat for now…

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:13.980
Damn it!

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.030
Don't mess with me!

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.190
He cannot escape this samsara, this loop.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:36.400
This is the other Forbidden Jutsu… the companion to Izanagi.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.690
The jutsu that decides one's fate…

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.900
This is the Izanami.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.900
Tailed Beast Counting Song!

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.070
All right, here we go!

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:04.940
One, "sleep is better than humans," says Shukaku

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.280
ONE TAIL SHUKAKU / GAARA One, "sleep is better than humans," says Shukaku

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.940
Two, burning in fire, Matatabi

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.280
TWO TAILS MATATABI / YUGITO NI'I Two, burning in fire, Matatabi

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.940
Three, leave the water to Isobu

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.280
THREE TAILS ISOBU / YAGURA Three, leave the water to Isobu

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.900
Four, hot as lava, Son Goku

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.320
FOUR TAILS SON GOKU / ROSHI Four, hot as lava, Son Goku

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.980
Five, always on the run, Kokuo

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.280
