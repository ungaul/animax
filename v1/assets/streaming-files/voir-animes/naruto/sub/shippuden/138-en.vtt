WEBVTT

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
All right. No one's around.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.130
For something I came up with in the spur of the moment,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.670
 that was a good plan!

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.930
Amaterasu!

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.100
What do you mean "good plan"?

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.400
You sacrificed several of my limbs.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.100
Now, now, don't get mad, my boy Eight-o.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.930
Ya know they'll regrow, and ya know I was right-o.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.030
Will you stop that annoying rapping when you're in my presence?

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.500
You suck!

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.930
I know, I know.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.330
Since I'm the one who owns ya, I knows best of all, ha!

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.370
That's why this time...

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.400
What? Don't start saying weird stuff again.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.600
It will be enka!

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.030
Anyways, now I can finally escape Brother's bossy ways

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.900
and get away from the village.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm free!

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.530
As far as he knows, the Akatsuki's captured me.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.830
Raikage is probably on a rampage now.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.370
Are you sure about this?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.800
I've been imprisoned in the village as a weapon

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.270
all because I'm a Jinchuriki.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.470
I need to get out for some fresh air once in a while, right?

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.270
So? What are you going to do?

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.930
When it comes to enka, Kin Sensei is the man!

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.170
Who is that?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.130
Huh?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.200
Blaze da name into ya brain fool.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.630
He's the King of the Enka Ninja.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.700
How can you be so carefree? The Akatsuki won't sit still for long.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.800
Not only that, since you summoned me,

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.630
you don't have much stamina left.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.970
Did you really have to call on me when you had the advantage?

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.970
Among all the guys I've faced in battle,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.200
that Sharingan has to rank in the top two in strength.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.900
I got carried away.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.500
Times may be changing soon.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.530
Huh? Through my enka?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.100
There's absolutely no trace left.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.930
The Transportation Technique... It's such a troublesome jutsu.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.200
Kakashi Sensei, what he was saying...

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.300
It's dangerous to believe his story.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.200
But if it's true, Sasuke is- Naruto...

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.070
I know how you feel, but you must not be impatient.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.600
For now, we'll keep what Madara said to ourselves...

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.300
in absolute secrecy.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.270
We're in the midst of reconstruction and must avoid unnecessary mayhem.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.470
Furthermore, until we cross check the facts, we can't trust him.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.500
There's too much that we don't know about his claim

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.300
that the higher ups in the Hidden Leaf used Itachi to slaughter the Uchiha clan.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.330
Especially you, Naruto. Do you understand?

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.930
Yeah, I know.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.700
Power of the Five Kage

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.070
Susano'o?

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.530
So that's the Mangekyo Sharingan?

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.930
That Uchiha... Always has something hidden up his sleeve.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.400
Darui, everyone from the Sand! Please step back!

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.770
He's aiming for the pillars!

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.500
The pillars!

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.230
The ceiling won't hold!

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.370
What the hell?!

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.100
Were you able to pinpoint Danzo's location?

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.270
Y-Yeah.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.070
Take me there.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.700
What about Jugo and Suigetsu?

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:55.170
Their chakra is still... Never mind! Danzo comes first.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.570
Hurry and take me there.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.030
O-Okay.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.230
What's happened to you, Sasuke?!

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.200
They're all right too.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.630
Sorry...Kazekage.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.330
Looks like Sasuke used that instant to get away.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.170
If things are this bad here,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.600
who knows what may have happened to the others.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.470
We're going after Sasuke immediately!

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.400
Looks like he's headed up.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.930
Naruto... What would you have done?

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.070
Good thing that blade missed, but still...

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.470
I wonder how Sasuke, Karin and Jugo are doing.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.530
I'll still make it.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.430
All right.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:25.300
He's come.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.070
Above?!

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.330
He's using the Sharingan.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.200
Sasuke! Danzo is escaping!

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.730
Lord Mizukage and Chojuro, stay here!

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.700
I'm going after Danzo!

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.430
Since the summit isn't over yet!

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.570
All right. But don't pursue him too far.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.600
Yes ma'am! I'll leave the Akatsuki rebels to you.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.900
My back can't take it.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.600
You people can deal with them as you please.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.300
Sounds good to me.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.230
Karin! Come!

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.370
There it is.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.830
Lady Mizukage's Kekkei Genkai, Lava Style Jutsu!

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.830
You Akatsuki manipulated the Fourth Mizukage

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.430
and trampled all over the Hidden Mist.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:22.200
And yet when I look at you closely, you of the Uchiha Clan are quite handsome.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.670
Don't interfere.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.100
Such a fine man... What a waste.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.330
I'll at least give you a kiss that will make you melt.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.830
A-A kiss?!

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.830
Just who the hell are you?!

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.870
And quit trying to seduce him, you old hag!

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.130
Lady Mizukage is intent on fighting!

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.630
I must protect her! But...

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.970
He's the one who killed Zabuza.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.470
Do I even have a chance?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.300
Yes, even someone like me has a chance. I can do it.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.300
I have to keep telling myself that.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.300
Lord Tsuchikage,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.370
if you're not going to participate, please keep your head lowered.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.000
Not that again!

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.030
Keep my head lowered? The nerve.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.530
Chojuro!

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.670
Y-Yes ma'am!

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.000
Hiramekarei release!

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.900
Every cell in my body hurts.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.770
Is this the side effect of using Susano'o...

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.530
for an extended period?

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.700
I haven't even achieved complete possession form

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.130
and yet there's so much pain.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.830
What did Itachi endure?

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.030
It's just the two of us now.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.400
S-So he was killed?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.130
I couldn't read his chakra, so I thought something was strange.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.530
The wall next to you...

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.430
I closed it up after that first attack.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.200
It's now a completely sealed room.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:05.870
There's no way to escape.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.000
I use three Chakra Natures: Fire, Water and Earth.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.630
That's why I possess two Kekkei Genkai.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.770
Vapor Style: Solid Fog Jutsu.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.370
Sasuke!

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.730
He's on the other side of that wall.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:33.770
It's melting.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.170
This is bad. Sasuke's chakra is weakening!

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.570
He's overdoing it!

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.200
It seems you got roughed up pretty badly by Lord Raikage earlier.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.400
Sorry, but I have no intention of helping you.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:03.500
It pains my heart every time I see such a handsome man melt away.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.630
But you have to die.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.930
So this time, it's corrosive acid mist?

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:19.800
What?

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.100
Wha-?!

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.370
What is it?!

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:32.700
This chakra...

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.570
Th-This is that Akatsuki from earlier.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.400
It's that man's...

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.600
I can't believe no one detected my Sporulation Jutsu.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.070
The Five Kage are just a bunch of idiots.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.600
He's...

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.400
using my chakra.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.070
He's absorbing chakra and growing?!

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.430
When did he do this?

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.130
It's a Time-Lapse Jutsu that he planted before Raikage beat him.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.570
Why you-

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.630
Damn... What now?!

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.870
My chakra is returning!

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.800
This is...

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.500
Sasuke! Are you all right?!

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.830
The mist will leak to where the others are.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.470
I have to adjust the pH level.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.770
It seems they're having difficulties.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.230
Akatsuchi, shall we go and lend them a hand soon?

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.200
Okay!

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.270
Earth Style: Weighted Boulder Jutsu.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.670
So a brat like you defeated Deidara?

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.000
Well, I hold no grudge against you, but many ninja wish you dead.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.830
So long.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.030
Particle Style: Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:06.970
Sasuke!

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.700
Sasuke's chakra is...gone!

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.930
I-It can't be...

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.200
You're right,

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.030
because I've disassembled his body at a near molecular level!

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.900
You're next.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.030
W-Why you...

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.230
Sasuke?

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.930
Where is Sasuke?!

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.030
Kankuro.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.370
Got it.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.930
Th-Thank you.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.300
I am indebted to you.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.100
Tsuchikage! Where is Sasuke?!

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.900
I turned him into dust.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.200
What?! I wanted to do that!

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:18.130
You had no right- You still...have a chance.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.330
So stop making a fuss, Raikage.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.730
My name is Madara Uchiha.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.830
Sasuke!

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.270
I have something I want to explain to you all.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.570
And once you comprehend it, I want to pose a question.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.130
What is it?!

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.930
It's about my plan...

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.600
Project Tsuki no Me.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.430
So that's what Project Tsuki no Me is.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.770
Stop joking around, I'm not handing the world over to you!

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.070
Peace is only meaningful when it is genuinely achieved.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.600
It's just an escape!

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.370
Unfortunately, the discussion is over.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.630
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Declaration of War"

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.700
The next time we meet, will be on the battlefield.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.630
Tune in again!
