WEBVTT

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.650
A Father's Hope, A Mother's Love

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.280
You're no longer a Jinchuriki?!

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.360
What do you mean?

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.440
The ones that are controlling you extracted the Shukaku from me.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.320
That killed me once.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.030
Sealing Jutsu! Nine Phantom Dragons!

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.440
Just what…

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.940
am I?

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.320
But thanks to Chiyo and my friends, here I am, alive.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.570
Granny Chiyo… She did that?!

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.690
And friends?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.570
You have friends?!

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.400
The things I did in the past were nothing but mistakes.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.070
But in my last hour,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.110
it seems I'm finally able to do the right thing.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.780
The Village of the Sand and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.980
the Leaf Village…

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.780
The future is likely to be different

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.730
from the way things were in our time.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.070
Gaara…

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.150
Gaara!

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.980
Naruto…

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.530
This is…?

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.530
Everyone came to help you.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.940
You thought he'd have no friends?

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.230
Man, he must've been some lonely kid, huh?

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.860
At that age, everyone has friends.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.650
Father, you tried to kill me six times.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.940
And each time, my fear and hatred of you grew.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.980
But I no longer hate you.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.610
I can understand why you did it.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.530
I am the Kazekage now.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.030
It is a leader's duty to eliminate threats against one's village.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.530
We must protect it.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.530
You are…the Kazekage?

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.480
That's not all.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.030
He is also the Commander-in-Chief of

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.440
the Allied Shinobi Forces' Main Battle Regiment.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.570
Despite his age, he not only calls himself Kage,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.400
he has the respect of all the other Kage as well.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.320
No wonder…

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.400
I thought it was odd I sensed chakra types

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.730
from various villages mixed together.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.610
Imagine that, shinobi forming an alliance.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.400
Not having eyebrows makes a face more charismatic…

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.400
Oh hey, I don't have eyebrows either.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.570
Then what about that wisp of a moustache, Mizukage?

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.190
Guys, if you're going to kill us, start with the mummy here!

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.610
I'll be more than happy to root for you.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.360
He's your son, huh.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.980
He's a fine shinobi.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.400
He's small… So he was premature?

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.070
Are you sure he'll be all right?

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.480
He's adapting.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.980
At last, with the third child, we know he's compatible.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.480
This child must be brought up with great care.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.230
Please let me see… my child's face.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.190
Are you all right, Karura?!

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.900
He's…so tiny.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.320
Lady Karura's heart rate is dropping.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.400
Do something! Quick!

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.570
This child is a failure as well.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.610
The rampages have begun.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.230
If we can't maintain our defenses further

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.400
the Sand will be weakened beyond repair.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.150
We need to figure out how we can negotiate with other lands,

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.440
and we have to do something about the Shukaku.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.400
As long as the Jinchuriki is unreliable,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.320
we must rely on Lord Kazekage's development of new jutsu,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.440
and in our gold dust trade for village stability.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.480
As for Gaara…

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.110
Yashamaru, I need to speak to you later.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.360
Yes…

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.110
But Lord Gaara is still a child…

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.780
Over the years, I've had to judge the value of many things.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.650
And I must test his worth too.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.440
We will assess Gaara tomorrow.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.440
After the village has been evacuated, corner Gaara.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.610
Tell him about his mother, and provoke him emotionally.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.360
If he doesn't go berserk, I won't kill him.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.610
About my sister?!

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.320
Are you sure about this?

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.320
I know that he loves and respects Karura with all his heart.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.150
If that is taken away from him, and if he can still suppress his rage…

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.360
then and only then, will he suffice as a Jinchuriki!

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.900
What?

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.070
Why me…?!

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.190
Why only me?!

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.940
Who is it?

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.440
Why?

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.360
I must hand it to you, Lord Gaara.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.320
Yashamaru…!

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.070
Why? Why?

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.860
Why you…Yashamaru?

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.530
Why?

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.570
It was an order.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.110
I was ordered to kill you.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.280
By your father…the Kazekage.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.530
Father?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.570
Why does Father want me dead?

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.570
Lord Gaara, before you were born,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.400
the Shukaku of the Sand was placed inside you.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.530
And you were nurtured carefully because of that experiment.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.860
However, you are unable to control the power

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.440
of the vengeful Spirit of the Sand, the Shukaku.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.530
Thus, you pose a threat to the village.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.570
Before any more damage is done… So you had no choice,

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.320
but to go along with Father's orders, Yashamaru?

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.320
No, that's not so.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.320
It's true, I was ordered by Lord Kazekage.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.400
However, I could have refused if I chose to do so.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:42.820
Lord Gaara… Deep down, I'm sure I resented you.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.280
You…who stole my dear older sister's life when you were born.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.480
You were my late sister's legacy.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.400
So I desperately tried to love you.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.480
But I couldn't.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.150
My sister never wanted you.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.030
She was sacrificed for the village,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.610
and she died cursing it.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.570
My heart has borne the wounds of that moment,

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.940
and it has never healed.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.610
My sister gave you that name.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.070
Her words were…

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.530
"This child will be known as Gaara, a demon that loves only itself."

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.610
"Love only yourself and fight only for yourself."

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.980
"Then you will continue to exist."

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.400
That was her wish.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:54.780
But she didn't name you out of love or concern.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.360
She gave you that name hoping that you would survive.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.070
She died resenting and cursing this world,

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.400
leaving you as reminder.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.780
So that the world would remember her hatred.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.900
You were never loved.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.730
It's a failure, after all.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.530
Gaara is a failed experiment.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.650
This Reanimation Jutsu may have some merit, after all.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:59.400
Let me see what you may be worth!

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.110
Can you defeat me?!

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.110
Ohnoki… Stop me.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.780
Against my Particle Style, the number of opponents means nothing.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.440
Only you can stop me.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.730
I'm aware of that.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.480
Also, you remember what to do with allies

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.480
after a victory, don't you?

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.440
Once the fighting ends, so is the alliance.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.440
There will be a scramble for the spoils of war.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.030
That is what truly decides which village is the victor.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.280
Hey, Tsuchikage, quit playing dirty!

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.610
I won't let that happen.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.820
I have no intentions of doing such a thing, Lord Mu.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.610
I see…

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.440
I guess you didn't turn into a stubborn old geezer.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.030
I wouldn't be too sure.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.610
In any case, we have no control over our movements.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.400
Our bodies are set to automatically counter the enemy's jutsu.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.400
So hurry and kill us, and send us back to the netherworld.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.780
We will tell you what our weaknesses and powers are.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.570
You just have to stop our actions!

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.820
It's not going to be easy.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.190
Everyone, go!

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.400
Let's go!

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.440
– Right! – Right!

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.530
Sand Hail!

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.280
Damn it!

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.530
Sand Hail is just a diversion.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.150
He used it to force me to lift the Gold Dust!

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.570
Karura… You still live on inside this child…

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.400
That really is our old man…

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.400
You've grown, Gaara.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.570
All a parent needs to do is to believe in their children.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.730
Just that little bit is the most valuable treasure.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.530
Isn't that right, Karura?

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:36.030
It seems I didn't possess the ability to see the true value of things…

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.570
What do you mean?

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.400
No matter when or what, the Sand will always protect you.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.480
That's not the Shukaku's power.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.400
But it's your mother's…Karura's.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.610
He's so tiny.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:02.150
No matter what happens, I will always protect you, Gaara.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.400
Your mother loved you!

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.150
Mother…loved me?

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.690
But that day when Yashamaru came after me, he said…

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.940
You were never…loved.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.440
I ordered Yashamaru to lie to you.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.400
In order to provoke you,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.150
and to test the volatility of the Tailed Beast inside you…

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.440
For the sake of the village.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.860
If there was anyone Yashamaru hated…

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.570
it would be me, not you.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.610
I'm the one who sealed the Shukaku of the Sand

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.730
into his pregnant older sister.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.570
But Yashamaru was also a shinobi.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.150
He was my right-hand man and a member of the Sand Black Ops.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.900
So he did as he was ordered, for the sake of the village.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.030
I failed.

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:12.940
It seems I failed in everything I did.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.190
I burdened you unnecessarily,

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.780
and arbitrarily decided that you weren't worth anything.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.400
I took away your future by turning you into the Jinchuriki

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.280
and I took your mother away from you.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.690
I robbed you of your love for your mother.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.360
I took away the bonds you had with people.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.610
And I even tried to take your life.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.440
As a parent… there is only one thing that I gave you.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.110
I gave you a broken heart.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.480
It's not bleeding.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.480
But it really hurts right around here.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:07.230
Physical wounds will definitely bleed and may look painful.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.400
But over time, they heal by themselves.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.940
And if you apply medicine, they will heal faster.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.860
What's troublesome are wounds of the heart.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.230
Nothing is harder to heal.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.440
Wounds of the heart?

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.480
They're a bit different from physical injuries.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.030
You can't apply medicine, for one thing.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.980
And sometimes, they never heal.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.900
There's only one cure for a wound of the heart.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.190
It's a bit bothersome and

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.730
you can only receive it from someone else.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.480
What is it?

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.360
It's love.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.820
– Love? – Yes.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.650
How do I get it?

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.360
You've already received it, Lord Gaara.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.900
Mother…

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.530
I believe your mother loved you immensely.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.570
Essentially, Shukaku of the Sand is a wraith to be used for offensive assaults.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.440
But when the Sand instinctively acts to protect you…

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.860
That is your mother's love.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.940
I believe your mother's will has seeped into the Sand.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:39.610
My sister…even in death… wanted to protect you, Lord Gaara.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.480
Karura…

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.070
Mothers are powerful.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.440
She's dead, but she believed in you and still protects you.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.440
She's the one who has brought you this far.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.570
She gave you life, so that you would become the Kazekage.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.070
She gave you friends.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.030
She gave you the bonds with your siblings and community.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.570
All things that I took away from you.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:23.150
All I did as your father was to torment you.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:27.230
I don't deserve to be called your father.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.480
My mother was wonderful indeed.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.360
Thanks to her, for the first time, I received medicine from my father.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.230
Gaara… You…

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.650
SEAL

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.650
You surpassed me long ago.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.030
I leave the village to you, Gaara!

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.780
Itachi Uchiha and Nagato?!

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.530
You know these guys, Naruto?

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.280
Yeah! Both of them!

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:47.360
Never would I have thought I'd have to battle you again, Naruto!

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.400
You now command the Power of the Nine Tails?

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.190
I'm impressed with your development!

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:58.860
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Contact! Naruto vs. Itachi"

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:04.940
Naruto, I must ask you… CONTACT! NARUTO VS. ITACHI

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.480
Tune in again!
