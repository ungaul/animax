WEBVTT

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.000
We're too late...

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.730
Sasori...

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.400
Neji...

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.730
Can you see what's happening to me here?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.270
Yeah...

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.730
The same thing is happening here.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.100
Tenten, what about you?

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.530
It's probably... the same here, too.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.700
Lee!

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.970
A strange shadow appeared in the forest as soon as I removed the tag.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.870
I thought so...

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.170
Team Kakashi has infiltrated just as planned.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.270
What is...this...?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.100
It's probably an enemy trap.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.800
I see...

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.530
So that's what this is about.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.170
I find you a worthy opponent.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.600
Traps Activate! Team Guy's Enemies 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.130
You jerk...!

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.770
Where do you think you're sitting?!

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.500
No doubt about it...

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.470
He's the Jinchuriki.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.370
"The first one to yell and scream at you," huh?

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.070
Itachi's pretty good at describing people.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.000
Sasori...

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.030
Gaara!

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.400
What're you doing sleeping leisurely in a place like that?!

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.930
Stand up!

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.500
Gaara!

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.830
Hey! Gaara! Are you listening?!

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.670
Knock it off!

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.630
That's enough, Naruto!

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.270
You should know...

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.400
That's right. You know, don't you?

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.200
That he's already long dead.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.470
Oh...

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.470
He's definitely...the Jinchuriki.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.670
Give him back...

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.070
Give Gaara back!

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.000
You jerks!

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.070
Calm down...

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.470
If you charge ahead without thinking, we'll be annihilated.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.970
A Shinobi usually operates

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.300
in a three-man squad or a four-man squad.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.530
But at least five people are required to destroy a Five-Seal Barrier.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.870
It can't be destroyed with just one team.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.870
You'd have to wait for another team to arrive.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.500
Just putting up a Five-Seal Barrier should serve as a means for stalling...

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.900
In addition, it's configured

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.030
so that a trap activates when the barrier is removed.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.970
Namely, a copy of the person who removes the tag appears nearby.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.370
They're preventing us from making our way through the barrier, huh?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.270
In other words...

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.770
we can't go back up to Naruto and the others

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.800
unless we defeat ourselves...

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.700
Is that how this works?

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.700
Exactly, Lee.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.530
They break up the four-man squad and separate us individually.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.700
And even taking precaution by placing a back-up on the barrier...

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.700
They're quite impressive.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.270
But...we can't just sit here acting impressed.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.170
Now, let's fight!

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.000
I'd expect no less from my fake! He's pretty good.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.330
They don't just look the same...

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.000
They've got the same power too, huh...?

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.370
We should consider them as having the same weapons too, huh...?

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.900
So basically everything about them is the same, huh?

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.870
This makes them even more worthwhile opponents, eh?!

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.200
What is it, Sasori my man?

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.030
I'll  take him.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:05.130
It seems that Jinchuriki wants to take him back, so...

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.500
It seems so.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.930
It appears the guy on the left

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.700
is the one who infiltrated the Sand alone and took Gaara.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.630
Which means this guy's...

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.300
the Puppet Master who seriously injured Kankuro...

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.130
Her grandson Sasori, huh?

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.030
My man...

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.200
You'll probably get mad if I say this...

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.200
But I'll take care of that Jinchuriki.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.230
Our mission is one Jinchuriki each.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.800
Don't be getting all full of yourself, Deidara...

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.100
An artist's passion starts to dull

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:12.930
unless they seek greater stimulation, my man...

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.270
The rumor is the Nine-Tailed Jinchuriki is quite powerful.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.770
He's an opponent suitable for my art.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.570
What? You're calling those explosions of yours art?

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.400
Art is something that beautifully remains...

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.470
extensively into the distant future.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.430
Eternal beauty is art!

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.030
Eternal beauty...is art?

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.400
I do respect you as a fellow craftsman, my man.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:09.600
But art is a fleeting moment of beauty that vanishes gloriously.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.430
What did you say...?

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.770
Wh-What's up with...these guys?

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:29.770
Deidara, it seems you don't understand what true art is...

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.870
You're the one who doesn't understand.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.700
You jerks...!

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.070
No! Eternal beauty is true art.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.730
Don't be a fool. Art is an instant of beauty.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.730
Knock it off!

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.470
Do you want to make me angry?

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.830
I just told you...

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.170
It would probably make you angry, didn't I...?

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:09.800
You know what happens when I get angry, don't you?

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.770
He blocked the shuriken without looking at all...

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.700
He's just as good with the Puppet Master technique

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.900
as he always was.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.130
How about it, Deidara?

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.130
Art to me is...

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.830
explosiveness itself!

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.300
It's a far cry from your silly puppet shows!

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.100
See you around, my man!

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.430
Make sure you follow me, Nine-Tailed Jinchuriki...

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.200
That jerk Deidara is doing as he pleases...

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.800
Hey, wait!

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.600
All right.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:02.870
Naruto!

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.630
I guess Naruto won't stop, will he?

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.130
Naruto and I will take care of the guy outside.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.570
Sakura and Granny Chiyo... you two handle the guy inside.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.970
However...

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.930
make sure you don't do anything rash until Team Guy gets back.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.370
Got it.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.370
He came too, huh...?

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.970
Guy, can you hear me?

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.570
The enemy has split up. We need backup.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.670
Return immediately.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.770
I don't think we can.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.970
We've all been caught in an enemy trap.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.300
Kakashi, give us a little more time.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.530
Signing off!

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.370
These movements...

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.500
We're an even match, huh?

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.070
I can't believe they look the same, have the same power

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.770
and even use the same Jutsu...

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.330
It's just like fighting our mirror images...

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.970
If it were mirrors, we only need to break it, but...

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.000
Leaf Hurricane!

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.730
It doesn't look like they'll be easily broken.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.770
Give Gaara back!

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.600
Looks like...

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.930
I can't be wasting my time...

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.670
I'd heard that you'd retired long ago.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.600
I suddenly wanted to see my grandson's face again.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.400
I can tell just by facing him.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.230
The incredible difference in actual battle experience...

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.330
and the number of people he's killed.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.870
Sakura, do not fear.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:14.900
I'm here. You step back.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.300
Assault Blade.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.330
If you're going to defy me, then I guess I have no choice...

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.000
Will you join that kid

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:03.570
as additions to my collection, Grandma Chiyo?

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.300
Only one event remains for the World Puppet Master Championship!

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.730
Will the proud title of first Puppet Master Champion

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.000
go to Sasori of the Red Sand, the master craftsman

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.600
who topped the first stage all-round toxin quiz challenge?!

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.300
Or will it go to Granny Chiyo,

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.730
the Sand's Consultant who displayed her years of experience and skills

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.800
during the second-stage Puppet-building race?

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.600
Who will win the final stage, the Puppet Battle?!

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:07.070
Next Time: Hiruko vs. Two Kunoichi!
