WEBVTT

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.000
Now!

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.930
Water Clone Jutsu!

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.300
Water Prison Jutsu!

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.430
Lee! Neji! Tenten!

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.400
Rasengan!

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.000
This is a Shadow Clone too.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.830
Sakura! Granny!

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.270
Saku...ra?

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.600
Kakashi Sensei!

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.470
What's going on?!

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.630
This is awful...

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.970
These kids are better than I thought... I'm surprised.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.200
I can't move...

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.470
Damn it!

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.470
I can't breathe...

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.830
Now we can fight without any interference.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.670
I want to help them out...

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.600
But under these circumstances, I'd just get in the way...

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.930
Make it through, guys!

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.970
This Great Shark Skin Sword will only allow me to use it.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.530
I see...

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.200
It's not a good idea to carelessly use someone else's weapon.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.330
Then I'll use mine, too...

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.000
Those are...Nunchaku!

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.730
I can't believe he's using Nunchaku...

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.800
This means the enemy's just that powerful!

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.330
I see... This is going to be interesting.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.230
Now, shall we begin?!

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.230
Naruto's Growth 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.600
Are they Shadow Clones?

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.130
And I didn't even look at his eyes...!

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.830
Damn it... How'd I get caught in his Genjutsu...?

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.100
These eyes aren't the only way I can activate a Genjutsu.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.630
I can do it with one finger.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.830
It's about time for you to come with me...

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.500
Naruto.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.670
It must've been back then...

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.570
Rest easy.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.730
I won't use the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.600
Or I guess I should say I can't use it right now...

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.370
What do you mean by that?

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.570
You don't need to know.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.870
More importantly, it's about time you went to sleep.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.270
Damn it... And I was so careful...

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.070
I can't believe I got caught in a Genjutsu...!

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:36.900
Genjutsu?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.070
Are you going to teach me Genjutsu, Pervy Sage?!

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.930
To be exact, I'm going to teach you how to break a Genjutsu.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.030
How to break...a Genjutsu...?

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.100
Listen up, Naruto.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.270
There's a trick to breaking a Genjutsu if you get caught in one--.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.470
Pervy Sage.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.470
You should know that trick very well...

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.330
Hey, Pervy Sage!

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.200
What?!

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.770
I want to know about how to cast a Genjutsu,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.470
not about if I get caught in one!

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.500
Huh?

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.970
Wh-What's up with that reaction?!

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.530
Listen up, Naruto...

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.430
A Genjutsu works on an opponent's five senses.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.070
You can control the Chakra flowing through their cerebral nervous system.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.830
It's a Ninjutsu requiring a great deal of intelligence.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.200
Hmm... I don't really get it... I didn't think so...

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.400
Nobody is telling you to master Genjutsu.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.730
You're not a Genjutsu-type Shinobi at all in the first place...

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.370
Huh? Really?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.330
Then forget about Genjutsu!

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.100
Let's get to my next training, my next training!

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.730
That won't do!

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.670
Why not?!

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.930
Some enemies use Genjutsu, after all.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.530
For example, Itachi Uchiha!

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.970
Come to think of it,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.330
even Kakashi Sensei was beaten by his technique...

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.200
That's why you need to know how to deal with Genjutsu!

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.570
Fine.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.500
When you're in a Genjutsu,

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.500
the Chakra inside your head is being controlled.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.670
So if you get caught in one,

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.400
make sure you temporarily stop

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.530
the flow of your own Chakra as best you can.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.000
Stop the flow...of Chakra...?

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.500
Thanks to your training until now,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.230
you've subconsciously concentrated Chakra

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.830
at the bottom of your feet and are standing on the water.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.470
Now that you mention it...

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.500
You need to temporarily stop all of it. Give it a try.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.600
Right!

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.030
First, I need to stop the flow of Chakra.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.830
Then with power greater than your opponent,

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.700
you need to immediately disrupt the flow of Chakra in one shot!

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.000
Got it!

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.570
If you do that...

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.630
the Genjutsu will be broken!

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.600
Guy Sensei...!

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.030
I'm running out of breath...

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.700
Tenten's reached her limit, huh...?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.730
Water Style: Shark Bomb Jutsu!

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.230
What incredible power...

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.830
I know! You're...

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.700
It's too late for you... to remember now!

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.470
Guy Sensei!

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.470
Guy Sensei... Don't tell me...!

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.070
Guy Sensei won't be beaten that easily!

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.530
That guy... I know I've met him somewhere...

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.530
Don't think I'm done settling the score just yet.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.970
Water Style...

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.430
Five Hungry Sharks!

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.300
First Meal!

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.630
Second Meal!

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.570
Third Meal!

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.400
No effect, huh...?

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.070
Fourth Meal!

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.970
Fifth Meal!

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:17.370
My five sharks will completely devour you and leave no bones!

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.500
Tenten!

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.670
This is not good... She's reached her limit...

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.230
I can't be slowed down any further...

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.570
I have no choice...

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.700
What's he planning?

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.770
The Eight Inner Gates... First Gate, Gate of Opening, Open!

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.370
Second Gate, Gate of Rest.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.630
Third Gate, Gate of Life.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.670
Fourth Gate, Gate of Pain.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.830
What's this remarkable power...?

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.570
Fifth Gate, Gate of Closing, Open!

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.370
What?!

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.130
Wh-What's that?!

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.770
There's an incredible amount of Chakra being emitted from the water!

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.330
Guy...

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.130
Surely he's not going to use that, is he?

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:43.400
The Eight Inner Gates! Sixth Gate, Gate of Joy...Open!

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.800
What's this?!

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:12.630
Now!

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.430
Here!

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.630
8 Trigrams 64 Palms!

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.000
Severe Leaf Hurricane!

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.970
Are you okay, Tenten?

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.530
Y-Yeah... Thanks, Neji...

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.070
We're saved...

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.130
That stance is...!

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.600
He has grown.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.770
Next, Naruto Uzumaki. Come on back.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.270
Doctor, something's wrong with my body!

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.200
Doctor, what's this?

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.330
Hmm, it's some terribly dry skin.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.700
No, it's not just that!

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.530
Oho, this is sure a large corn.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.900
Look at this, too!

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.900
Th-That large growth on your shoulder...!

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.530
Hmm, it's the boil I've heard rumors about, no mistake.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.730
Doctor, what should I do?

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.630
Oh, you don't need to worry. The baby in your belly is doing just fine!

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.400
- What?! - Congratulations.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.530
Hey, just a minute. I'm a guy!

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.330
Next episode: "The Secret Weapon is Called..."
