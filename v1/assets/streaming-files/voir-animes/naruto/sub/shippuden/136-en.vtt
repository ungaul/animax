WEBVTT

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.600
Hey...

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.200
How about we talk, Naruto Uzumaki?

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.570
You!

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.730
A Rasengan right off the bat, huh?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.270
You know it doesn't work on me, right?

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.000
Naruto, you just stay put.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.770
As expected, Sharingan Kakashi.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.270
You are fast.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.230
We won't let you get your hands on Naruto that easily, Madara Uchiha.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.830
You did just hear my last line, didn't you?

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.830
No attacks work against Madara Uchiha.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500
I don't know if you are merely erasing your presence

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.900
or if this is an astral projection,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.270
but I know it's necessary for you to manifest physically

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.600
in order to capture Naruto.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.730
Otherwise, you couldn't actually grab him.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.970
We'll aim for that.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.600
This here is now my territory.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.600
I never thought it would be easy. You see, I have my own plan.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.070
But right now, I'd rather talk.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.500
Talk?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.630
Yes. What was it that made Pain, Nagato, turn into a traitor?

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.130
Naruto... You have aroused my curiosity.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.630
Who cares about something like that?!

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.870
What do you intend to do with Sasuke?!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.630
Tell me about Sasuke!

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.670
Sasuke, huh?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.000
Very well. I'll tell you.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.470
About the man whose hatred of the ninja world

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.430
runs through his bones to his very core.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.770
About Sasuke Uchiha.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.270
Sasuke's story cannot be told without mentioning Itachi.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.400
So first, hear the truth about Itachi.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.800
Where is Sasuke?! Answer me!

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.200
You leave me no choice. I'll give you a hint, so...

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.430
Shee! Begin!

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.530
Yes sir!

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.370
You didn't have to kill him.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.570
We could have taken him in and tortured him

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.130
into revealing intel about the Akatsuki.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.430
No one in the Akatsuki talks. They are extremely loyal.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.170
Okisuke, Urakaku. Issue an order to search for Sasuke.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.400
And issue a Number 2 battle-ready state alert.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.400
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.230
Lord Raikage!

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.570
You! One-eyed Mist!

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.170
Watch the Hokage!

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.530
Shee! Darui!

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.830
Come!

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.270
I'm so sorry about the desk and the wall.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.700
Darui, never mind that. Let's go!

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.030
What a violent fellow.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.470
The Cloud's rascal hasn't changed even as a Kage.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.500
Number 2 battle-ready state alert.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.970
Search for the intruder, Sasuke Uchiha.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.230
Dispatch three squads to the tower entrance.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.470
Create a line of defense.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.070
Roger.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.800
Move out!

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.470
What's this?!

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.570
What is it, Karin?

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.100
The Samurai's movements have suddenly become flurried.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.200
I think they're looking for us!

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.330
What?!

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.730
But we didn't do anything to be spotted.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.130
I bet it was Zetsu.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.330
They're already gone.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.270
Racing Lightning

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.200
It's no good. There are too many of them.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.900
We'll be found in no time and captured.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.130
Zetsu, was it? I'll get him for this!

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.230
So that's how they use chakra?

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.700
I'm very irritated right now.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.930
If you attack, I'll show no mercy.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.230
I would say the same to you!

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.770
He repelled it?

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.670
It's similar to our sword technique!

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.770
Karin, you don't have to monitor the Samurai anymore.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.870
Focus on Danzo's location.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.930
But what about the Samurai?

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.670
I'll deal with them.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.630
Just find Danzo.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.070
Huh?!

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.670
Sasuke's chakra is different!

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.630
Hey... After all his warnings telling me not to kill anyone...

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:42.970
This is...

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.600
He's not the same Sasuke as before.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.230
He's more intense than when he is in the Curse Mark Second State.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.530
And much...

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.200
colder.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.000
He's not alone!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.570
There's one chakra that is erasing many other chakras!

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.630
No doubt it's coming from Sasuke!

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.570
Which way?!

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.330
Right below us!

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.930
Lord Raikage, you're not going to...

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.330
Something's coming. And it's huge!

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.670
What is that?!

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:50.930
Hey brat!

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.200
I'm going to teach you the fear of true fury!

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.070
Sasuke! Don't go in alone!

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.270
He's lost his cool!

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.800
Water Style: Water Wall!

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.970
His attack, huh?

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.700
Lightning Style: Emotion Wave!

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.030
Looks like the intel was right, Boss.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.370
This guy seems to possess a Lightning Chakra Nature.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.200
Plus he has a Fire Chakra Nature.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.500
He's bound to use Fire Style at some point.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.430
Darui, keep Water Style ready at all times.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.400
Yeah.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.700
Doesn't it look like they have intel on Sasuke?

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:49.000
Hey, the one in the middle. Isn't that...?

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.430
They're Hidden Cloud jonin.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.630
The huge one in the middle is their Raikage.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.730
They won't let us pass easily.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.330
Seeking reinforcements!

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.400
Sasuke got us!

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.030
I'll stop him!

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.370
Something's coming!

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.330
Lightning Illusion: Flash Pillar!

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.930
Is he trying to blind us?!

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.070
Sasuke!

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.800
No!

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.030
Jugo, don't waver. This is a genjutsu.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.400
Not bad, Sharingan. However...

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.030
You may have seen through the genjutsu, but it's too late!

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:38.700
Sasuke!

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.070
Damn it! My Executioner's Blade!

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.570
It'd already gotten cracked against the Eight-Tails.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.700
It can't be helped.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.330
S-Saved. Nice, Suigetsu!

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.100
Who told you to butt in?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.830
We came to help you, and this is what we get?

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.130
Although that's just like you.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.170
Ninja sure fight rough.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.030
They're crazy!

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.930
Shee, check and see if they've got any other allies around.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.800
I don't want to worry about more popping in.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.100
I'm sure there was one more.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.070
But if I focus on that one, it'll be hard to stay in the fight.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.870
We don't need you.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.470
Boss and I can handle them.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.800
Uh-oh! If I keep searching for Danzo like this,

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.930
I'll be the one found by that Shee.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.930
Karin will probably extinguish her chakra and hide.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.730
She's got that ability.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.300
That guy in the back is probably a Sensory-Type ninja.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.700
We have to take him down.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.770
I'll do it.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.000
It doesn't look like he'll be moving around again.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.130
Sir Ao, please confirm

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.800
if the Hokage's Ocular Jutsu is still engaged or not.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.370
No. The flow of chakra in his Chakra Network is very calm.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.030
The jutsu is undone.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.170
Relax. It's not a jutsu I can use that many times in a day.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.870
I'll decide that. For you are a man who cannot be trusted.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.630
I never imagined the Byakugan had fallen into outside hands.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.570
Had the traitor been a Hyuga from the Hidden Leaf,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.400
he would have been killed immediately.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.700
You are probably planning to dispose of me for learning your secret,

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.000
but that will not happen.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.200
I shall fight you at such a time.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.630
Because there may just be a connection

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.200
between the jutsu that had control over the Fourth Mizukage

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.200
and your ocular powers.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.870
Lord Hokage, ninjutsu is prohibited in this room.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.200
You have lost your credibility.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.430
Even if you hadn't resorted to this, I may have chosen you, you know.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.070
"May have chosen" was unacceptable.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.500
I was prepared to use any means necessary

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.500
in order to protect the world of the ninja.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.970
This world must become one.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.330
In the same way that the First Hokage, Hashirama,

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.170
united our people and founded our village.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.170
This time, I shall unite the villages and create one ninja world.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.800
There is no way this ninja world can be united through discussions alone.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.570
It takes time to realize one's ideals.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.930
Impatience makes one lose sight of his surroundings and invites failure.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.800
That's you right now.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.900
Nothing will change by working slowly and ethically.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.130
Sooner or later, the Akatsuki will destroy the ninja world.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.530
Well, that is just an impossible dream.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.130
It may sound noble, but ultimately,

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.200
it will only breed distrust, ill will and resentment.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.700
Why Danzo, we don't even trust your words at this point.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.830
Whether I am trusted or not, it's the outcome that is essential.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.430
Unable to trust each other.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.600
If that is the world...

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.400
If that is being human, there is no future.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.830
What is it you want to say?

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.300
Understanding and trusting in one another...

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.000
If we lose that, only fear will remain in the world.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.200
Acting with no regard for what is right... resigning oneself...

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.430
I find such things hard to accept these days.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.930
For a kid who knows nothing about governing a village yet,

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.600
you speak easily about difficult matters.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.870
Now's your chance to ask anything you'd like.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.130
As your seniors, we're willing to answer any questions you have.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.700
Right, Danzo?

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.600
How dare you, you old geezer!

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.500
Don't, Kankuro.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.700
He's still Tsuchikage. The leader of another village.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.700
Did she just say "still"?

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:25.570
Ignore them.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.070
Then let me ask you this.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.200
Sure. I will answer anything, kid.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.330
When did you all forsake yourselves?

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.730
What a pure-hearted child.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.700
So Gaara, what will we do now?

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.370
We cooperated with the Hidden Leaf on their mission

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.830
to rescue Sasuke Uchiha.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.270
But he's now descended to joining the Akatsuki.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.300
Sasuke Uchiha...

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.270
Hey! Don't go off without your guards!

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.400
Gramps, he's scored a point on you.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.830
Shut it!

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.500
Lord Tsuchikage... What do we do?

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.900
Shall we go forth to battle?

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.200
Fool! What if the back pain gets worse?!

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.800
But I want to see this Sasuke who supposedly took down Bro Deidara.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.500
Do as you please.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.270
Just remember, if you get caught in the Raikage's crossfire,

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.370
you'll die.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.500
So stay out his way.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:30.800
Gotcha!

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.170
What about you, Akatsuchi?

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:37.570
I'll stay with Lord Tsuchikage, in case he has trouble with his back.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.230
Later, then.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.630
Lord Danzo, please allow one of us to go forth

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.530
in order to retrieve the Sharingan.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:53.630
You Hidden Leaf will stay as you are! Lord Raikage has so ordered!

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.600
Foo, Torune...don't.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.270
We will play nice for now.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.070
I'll kill 'em!

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.830
His change in personality is more surprising than his appearance.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.500
Focus! This guy's chakra is ridiculous!

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:34.300
Jugo voluntarily gave in to his killer impulse this time.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.130
You think he still remembers that we're on his side?

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.670
Now then, who's first?!

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.100
Don't get cocky!

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.800
You're mine!

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.930
Nice blade you got there.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.100
Can't have this just because yours broke.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:35.930
One down.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.800
You can't take me down with a mere Sharingan!

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.330
Lord Raikage's nerve transmission and reaction speed

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.230
are on par with that of the Leaf's Yellow Flash.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.630
Impressive that these guys are keeping up as well as they are!

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.830
But Lord Raikage has manipulated Lightning Style Chakra

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.270
to augment his reflexes.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.100
Not even the Sharingan will be able to keep up with him.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.500
Plus, there's still...

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.370
Die!

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.200
Boss!

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.270
From point-blank range!

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.930
Did he get him?!

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.400
He took Lord Raikage's blow and still survived?!

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.200
I-Is this is...a genjutsu?

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.400
These guys are cleverly using each other's attacks to divert attention.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.430
And I fell for it. Damn it!

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.730
Can't...move...

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:04.900
Shee?!

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.000
Shee! Don't go to sleep! Get up!

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.830
I killed him! I killed the guy!

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.170
Jugo can be useful, after all.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.530
They can't detect me now.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.500
Now's my chance to find Danzo.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:35.230
Huh?!

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.900
Who's next?!

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.800
It's not too late.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.870
You still have the chance to go back, Sasuke.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.770
What is there for me on your side if I were to go back?

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.730
I shut my eyes a long time ago.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.730
The things I seek lie only in the darkness.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.170
Wait!

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.370
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Sasuke's Ninja Way"

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.300
Gaara, don't let your personal feelings interfere.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.200
Tune in again!
