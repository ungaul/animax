WEBVTT

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.130
The tale of shinobi… is the tale of restoring Mother.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500
I shall now show you two…

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.630
I don't have any candy,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.080
but the puppet show is about to begin…

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.970
Kaguya Otsutsuki

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.470
Look at that!

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.470
It's glowing! It looks suspicious!

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.090
What is it?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.510
Is it a star?

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.300
That's no star, it's moving!

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.550
How terrifying!

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.180
Follow it!

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.470
Yes, sir!

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.970
A woman?

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.930
And you're saying that she came from the heavens?

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.090
Yes…

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.380
This woman appeared in the spot where the light had fallen.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.260
Be careful!

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.840
Hmm… What is your name?

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.340
Answer him!

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.970
The man standing before you is the King of the Land of Sou,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.800
Lord Tenji!

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.010
You there!

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.680
The Land of Ka must have sent this woman to spy on us!

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.800
Interrogate her and make her confess!

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.680
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.470
Wait.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.930
You—!

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.180
What did you do?!

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.340
What's the matter?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.720
My name is Kaguya.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.380
Kagu…ya?

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.180
I am the one who protects the Divine Tree.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.430
I have been assigned to take care of your needs.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.760
I am Aino…

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.680
Lady Kaguya?

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.590
Several millennia ago, that tree appeared out of nowhere

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.970
and grew into a massive tree before our very eyes.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.090
But I have heard frightening rumors too.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.260
Anyone who approaches it is quickly consumed by a demon spirit

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.340
and dies like a withered branch.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.590
Forgive me for speaking of such things!

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.050
Do not worry. For it is true… Huh?

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.180
And some day…

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.590
Lord Tenji!

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.880
Ministers Suzaku and Genbu from the Land of Ka are here to see you.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.130
This is the border between the Land of Ka and the Land of Sou.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.380
The issue is this lake.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.010
Presently, this region is said to be part of the Land of Sou…

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.340
But an ancient manuscript was recently discovered.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.340
On it, has been recorded from time immemorial,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.510
that this land was originally within the Land of Ka's territory.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.380
We wish to have this land returned to us.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.840
But that lake is our source of water for our farmlands in the Land of Sou.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.930
If I were to return that land…

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.930
No matter what situation arises,

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.340
to return what was stolen to its true owner…

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.260
is the right thing to do.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.090
If we do not receive a favorable answer,

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.840
we cannot be responsible for whatever misfortune

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.800
befalls the Land of Sou!

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.680
Now, now…

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.180
I'm sure you will need some time to prepare and take care of things.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.800
We shall return in a few days to hear your answer.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.130
By the way,

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.130
I understand you have taken a celestial maiden as a concubine.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.800
I hear she is indescribably beautiful and mysterious.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.300
I am most curious to see her.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.840
Without a doubt,

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.590
this recently discovered artifact is a fabrication by the Land of Ka.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.800
I am aware of that…

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.220
The Land of Ka makes false claims against neighboring lands

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.260
as a pretext to war.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.840
That's how they've expanded their lands.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.800
This case is no different.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.800
But they have an army three times greater than the Land of Sou.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.840
There is no way we can win.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.260
Suzaku and Genbu…

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.930
Sending those two as messengers means…

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.430
The Land of Ka is serious.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.720
We cannot be meek—

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.010
Lord Tenji, let's stand up to them!

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.880
If we are doomed anyway,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.930
let's go down fighting and show them the pride of the Sou!

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.050
Do not panic just yet.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.470
Lord Tenji!

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.630
What is Kaguya doing?

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.180
Lady Kaguya spends her days looking up at the sky like that.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.970
It's as though she's waiting for someone to come for her…

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.880
According to the villagers,

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.010
they say Lady Kaguya came from the heavens…

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.010
The thing is…I don't remember my first encounter with Kaguya.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.260
Oh?

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.840
May I borrow that?

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.340
Huh? Oh this?

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.930
You must be freezing, standing in the cold night air for so long.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.840
I wonder if that glowing world above is always beautiful and at peace…

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.680
A strange feeling comes over me as I gaze up at the night sky…

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.880
The fact that such a beautiful light lies afloat in pitch darkness…

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.010
Just what is it? Will I ever be able to go there?

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.760
I hear that you gaze up at the sky every night…

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.880
Are you waiting for someone?

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.930
It's all right if that's the case.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.090
From now on, whenever you're lonely and look up at the sky,

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.590
I shall be by your side.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.010
Is there anything that you desire?

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.300
What I wish…is for peace with no more fighting.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.220
Peace…huh?

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.220
They're from the Land of Ka!

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.970
Why that—! They're messing with us!

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.130
Don't!

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.010
Can't you see they're just trying to provoke us?!

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.260
Damn it!

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.260
Lord Tenji!

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.840
The mischief caused by the Land of Ka at our border

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.970
is growing steadily worse!

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.340
Unless we take action…

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.220
the farmers' ire will reach a breaking point!

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.550
I understand…

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.470
But I forbid you to confront the Land of Ka.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.590
But—!

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.800
I seek peace.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.550
If fighting ensues, many will die.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.220
We must move forward with peaceful negotiations with the Land of Ka.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.840
Anyone who makes a move on the Land of Ka

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.840
will be executed on my order.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.470
What is he thinking?

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.930
Is Lord Tenji here?

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.930
Yes… He comes nearly every night.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.220
It seems Lady Kaguya has come to accept his presence recently,

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.720
and they've been spending more and more time together.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.260
I didn't ask you for details!

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.100
Lord Tenji! Lord Tenji!

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.060
What do you want at this hour?

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.890
The Land of Ka is at the border with a large army!

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.760
What?!

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.720
Kaguya… I must depart for the front immediately.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.600
To war?

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.010
No, this is for peace.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.010
But if things should go wrong…

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.970
Prepare to go into hiding right away!

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:31.970
Yes!

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.100
Do not worry. I shall return right away.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.180
Let's go!

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:46.680
Yes!

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.720
Guard the castle.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.010
Leave it to us.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.970
So that Kaguya has left the capital of Sou…

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.970
This is the perfect opportunity to capture that woman.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.510
There's no need to rush.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.100
The Land of Sou will be ours in no time.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.100
It's just one woman… Be patient.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.390
It's my policy to get what I want as fast as I can.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.010
You're hopeless…

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.350
Gather skilled men. We're going after Kaguya.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.350
Yes, sir!

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.930
You can't sleep?

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.970
I'll stay with you.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.640
Enemy attack! Alert!

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.060
Lady Kaguya! Lady Aino!

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.680
What's going on?

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.640
So this is where you were hiding!

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.930
Who are you?!

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.180
You dare approach knowing that this lady is Lord Tenji's concubine?!

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.970
Tenji?

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.760
I'm from the Land of Ka, why should I care about him?

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.220
The Land of Sou will fall very soon.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.060
To put it bluntly, what belongs to Tenji will soon belong to me.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.430
The rumors were right… such a beauty.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.060
And very refined.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.350
From this moment on, you are mine!

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.850
Lady Kaguya, please run!

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.010
Lady Kaguya…

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.810
Like you can escape!

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.310
Lady Kaguya!

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.350
Even in this situation, you're not scared…

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.060
Well, that just makes me like you more!

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.220
Take her!

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.180
Do not touch me.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:57.970
Don't back off!

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.640
So the bewitching beauty is actually a monster…

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.180
Th-The Land of Sou is really doomed now…

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.810
I would like you to withdraw your troops immediately.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.350
You seem to be under the wrong impression, Lord Tenji.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.760
We are not at war.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.100
This army is just to protect our boundary.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.600
Such a large army just to protect the boundary is…

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.010
I do not intend to wage war either.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.930
There's proof in the fact that

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.260
I have ordered anyone who draws his sword against the Land of Ka

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.010
to be executed immediately.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.010
Oh, is that so?

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.140
Then I want you to execute Kaguya.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.890
This woman known as Kaguya killed my vassal, and then tried to kill me!

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.220
Impossible…

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.060
Kaguya would never—!

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.970
If you think I'm lying, ask this woman.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:05.720
Is it true?

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.140
Yes.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.470
Lady Kaguya…

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.350
dispatched the soldiers of Ka with frightening power…

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.720
Lord Tenji!

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.930
Unless you behead Kaguya, this war will not end!

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.470
I'm leaving.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.600
What happened to you?

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.390
That woman Kaguya… is a horrible monster.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.010
Leave the witch-hunt to them…

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.350
And in the interim, we'll conquer everything.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.010
Kaguya did this?

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.510
Whatever the reason,

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.510
there seems to be no doubt that she tried to kill Sir Suzaku.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.140
Kaguya…

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.680
What are you going to do, Lord Tenji?!

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.970
Are you really going to execute Lady Kaguya?

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.720
Unless I give them her head, war will not be averted…

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.930
Are you really willing to do that?

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.060
Send all troops after Kaguya…

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.220
Leave no stone unturned. Find her.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.810
I have no other choice…

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.100
Are they… …pursuers?

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.010
They're from the Land of Sou!

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.850
So Lord Tenji dispatched them!

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.600
Let us hurry. My fate is with the Divine Tree!

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.930
Lady Kaguya!

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.350
If you explain what happened to Lord Tenji,

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.560
I'm certain that he will forgive you…

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.560
Lady Kaguya… My strength…

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.760
Lady Kaguya! Could you be…with child?

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.060
This is terrible!

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.140
How could Lord Tenji—?!

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.930
I must get to the Divine Tree…

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.060
Please go… I will stop them.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.220
Wait!

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.100
Lord Tenji! Please order your soldiers to retreat!

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.930
Lady Kaguya is with…

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.640
Aino!

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.100
…with your child, Lord Tenji!

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.310
Lady Kaguya…

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.350
Please bear…a healthy…

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.600
Aino!

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.100
It's now time to destroy the Land of Sou!

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.390
Onward!

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.100
The Land of Sou will now be ours.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.100
Kaguya…

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.100
Kaguya!

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.010
Shine upon the world, Infinite Tsukuyomi!

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.220
What is this?

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.600
Kaguya…

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:59.680
What…are…you?

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:12.810
I shall rule over this world… Together with my children.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.030
Mother loved this world.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.150
She tried to love humans.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.820
But that hope was dashed.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.900
She personally ate the fruit of the Divine Tree

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.360
to try and protect her children.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.940
But real despair started there…

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.900
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Hagoromo and Hamura"

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.280
Shortly after, Mother gave birth to twins.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:29.030
HAGOROMO AND HAMURA Tune in again!
