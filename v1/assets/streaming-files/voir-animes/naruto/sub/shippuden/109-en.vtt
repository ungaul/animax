WEBVTT

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.730
Sealing of the Six-Tails... is done.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.430
It takes time when there are five of us.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.100
There are two Tailed-Beasts left.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.470
Yes... I've sent Sasuke to go and retrieve the Eight-Tails.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.530
Can we trust him?

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.070
I can vouch for Sasuke.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.400
I know that you're alone.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.670
So why don't you run?

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.000
Hah! My numbers can go from one to a thousand!

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.630
Besides, I can't run away!

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.600
If I capture you, I get to see Sasuke!

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.730
Why are you so attached to my brother?

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.870
He's a Rogue Ninja.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.030
That's because unlike you...

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.900
I think of him as a brother more than you ever would.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.030
You're already under my genjutsu.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.030
Damn it!

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.730
I'll say it again.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.200
I just wanted to talk to you for a moment.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.530
You've been trying to take Sasuke back to the village.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.070
But what if it doesn't go the way you want?

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.570
I'll do anything to make it happen.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.600
Even by force?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
If by some turn of luck,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.900
Sasuke goes with you willingly, great.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.730
But what if the exact opposite happens?

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.170
What does that mean?

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.170
You just said you consider Sasuke to be like a brother...

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.330
What if Sasuke were to attack the Leaf Village?

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.170
What would you do then?

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.570
What? Why would Sasuke...?

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.870
There's no way he'd do something like that!

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.430
Sasuke is still naïve. He can easily be dyed in any color.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.930
In such a case, can you stop him?

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.170
Even if you have to kill Sasuke?

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.800
Could you weigh Sasuke against the Leaf Village

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.730
on a set of scales?

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.200
I would defend the Leaf Village!

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.730
But I would also stop Sasuke without killing him!

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.300
You're such a child...

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.800
What you speak of are all fantasies.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.370
A ninja must sometimes make very harsh decisions.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.170
You should give up on Sasuke.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.930
He was destined to leave, sooner or later.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.670
Don't suffer anymore... Forget and dismiss him.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.730
It's not just jutsu or power... If you're a ninja,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.800
develop eyes that can make the right judgment.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.170
And if you're going to live as a ninja, become wiser.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.370
This world...

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.870
It's no place for a fool. That's the reality.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.970
Okay, I got it.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.070
If that's what being wise is, I'd rather live my life as a fool.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.100
Even if I have to do it alone,

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.600
I'll figure out a bigger, better jutsu and rescue Sasuke.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.700
Someone told me that before...

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.430
But for me, there is no choice.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.670
I never go back on my word...

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.230
That's my Ninja Way.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.770
I have shared some of my power with you.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.000
Though I hope the day never comes

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.100
when you have to use it.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.470
What's going on?

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.070
Aren't you after me? Then let's finish this!

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.400
I'm going now...

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.930
I have an important task to do.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.670
What did Itachi mean by that? Why did he...?

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.630
Sasuke has won. Itachi Uchiha is dead.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.470
Sasuke's down too, but... I wonder how he is?

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.530
He's in pretty bad shape.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.930
What are you doing now, Sasuke?

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.670
You're okay, right?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.830
Are you all right, Sasuke?

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.930
Yeah... Let's hurry.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.570
We're almost at the rendezvous point.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.300
As promised, I brought the Eight-Tails.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.670
You did well. I had faith that you could do it.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.630
Where are you going?

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.270
First, I'm going to tend to my wounds.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.900
Then...

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.370
I'm going to the Hidden Leaf.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.830
I'm going to ask one important question...

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.230
After learning about Itachi's life, there is a chance

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.870
that you will carry out his wish and protect the Hidden Leaf.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.970
Tell me the truth. What are your intentions?

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.330
Itachi showed me how a man would give his life

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.500
to protect his village.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.370
But for me, the sadness of losing Itachi

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.070
impacts me more deeply than how he lived...

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.400
Unbearably more.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.770
The peace that Itachi sacrificed himself for isn't appealing to me.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.270
Now that I know the truth,

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.600
following in Itachi's steps to protect the Hidden Leaf

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.800
is the last thing I would do.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.570
Most of all, I will never forgive the three elders.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.330
And I believe that everyone in the Hidden Leaf enjoying the peace

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.730
gained in exchange for Itachi's life is guilty too.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.930
I thought you were only going to kill the elders?

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.700
No... I wish to slaughter the entire Leaf Village by myself.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.170
I was just feigning in front of Taka.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.730
Is that the truth?

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.400
After knowing just what Itachi went through

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.900
to protect the village...

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.630
Instead of carrying on his wish, you'd destroy the village?

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.800
Are you serious?

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.800
You said so yourself.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.800
The reason why Itachi couldn't bring himself to kill me was...

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.400
he cherished my life more than the village.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.330
I feel the same way.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.370
Itachi's life is more precious to me than the village.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.930
That's all.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.230
They shunned the Uchiha clan.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.500
They forced my brother to kill his own parents!

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.500
The elders who cast him out and sealed his death!

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.200
And the rest of the Hidden Leaf who abide by the Senju clan!

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.570
They're nothing but scum!

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.230
They are all objects of my vengeance!

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.230
If you want to ridicule me as a brat

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.330
swayed by his emotions, go ahead.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.400
Carrying on Itachi's wish are merely pretty words.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.030
The foolish sputtering of those who don't know hatred.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.030
If anyone criticizes my way of life,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.530
I'll kill every single one of their loved ones!

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.200
Then they might understand a little...

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.000
...of the hatred I carry.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.430
When a man learns to love, he must bear the risk of hatred.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:50.800
What?!

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.170
Killer Bee was taken?!

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.830
A member of the Hidden Leaf... from the Uchiha clan

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.270
was among the assailants.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.430
My partner is tailing them right now.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.100
Lord Raikage, what are your orders?

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.170
The Akatsuki won't get away with this!

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.500
The Akatsuki...!

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.700
Just you wait, my brother!

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.400
Somber News

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.330
Oh, it's you, Kakashi Sensei.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.930
Lady Hokage has summoned you. Let's go.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.130
Huh? Chief Toad and Gamakichi?

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.170
Yo, Naruto!

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.270
What're you guys doing here so early?

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.530
Did something happen?

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:31.800
Actually...

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.270
Gamakichi! It's not your place to say anything.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.300
Leave this to the Boss and Tsunade.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.070
What's going on?

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:46.930
Just hurry up.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.530
He is Jiraiya-boy's student?

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.300
Yes... This is Naruto Uzumaki...

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.630
The "Child of Prophecy" you mentioned.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.700
A geezer frog? What the hell?

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.100
Hey! Watch your mouth, Naruto!

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.230
This is Lord Fukasaku,

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.800
one of the Two Great Sages of Mount Myoboku.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.870
He came all the way here to speak with you.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.570
Well, to be more accurate, I am a Great Sage Toad.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.670
But never mind that.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.000
You are, without a doubt, Jiraiya-boy's student.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.070
Jiraiya-boy? "Boy"?!

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.300
You talk as though the Pervy Sage is a kid!

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.030
Who does this geezer frog think he is?!

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.270
I said to watch your mouth!

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.100
This great man is the one

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.930
who taught Sage Jutsu to Lord Jiraiya.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.270
He is Lord Jiraiya's master.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.630
Pervy Sage, eh?

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.630
What a fitting nickname for Jiraiya-boy.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.000
So what does this geezer sage want with me?

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.100
I'm not sure where to begin.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.000
But let's see...

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.630
I suppose the most important thing is...

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.730
Jiraiya-boy has died in battle.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.370
Huh?

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.130
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.970
I know this is sudden.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.530
I don't blame you if you don't believe me.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.500
For quite some time, there were rumors

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.430
that the leader of the Akatsuki was in the Hidden Rain Village.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.000
Jiraiya-boy went in person to verify the truth of these rumors.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.630
The leader of the Akatsuki was in the Hidden Rain Village?

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.700
As I recall, that village is difficult to infiltrate.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.370
A village closed to the outside world.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Yes... However, Lord Jiraiya was skilled

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.630
in infiltration and espionage tactics.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.800
Exactly...

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.630
That's the decision I've made...

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.670
Jiraiya Sensei.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:39.200
Jiraiya-boy came upon the leader of the Akatsuki..."Pain."

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.270
However...

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.570
You look very different. But those eyes...

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.070
So you were Pain... Nagato!

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.300
It seems you've strayed off the path of good.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.230
What happened?

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.970
You don't need to know. After all, you are an outsider.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.400
Pain was Jiraiya-boy's former student.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.830
Student? What do you mean?

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.770
Jiraiya-boy called him "Nagato."

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.700
That goes way back.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.030
During the chaos of the Great Ninja War...

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.570
Jiraiya looked after some orphans in the Hidden Rain Village,

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.230
which had become a battlefield.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.670
Who would have imagined that those kids...

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.800
However... To corner a ninja like Lord Jiraiya...

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.200
How did this Pain...?

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.730
He possessed the Rinnegan.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
What did you say?!

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:46.970
Rinnegan?

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.830
The Rinnegan is an Ocular Jutsu

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.130
that was said to be possessed by the father of all ninja,

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.730
the Sage of the Six Paths.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.900
I thought it was just a legend.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.800
The legendary Ocular Jutsu... The Rinnegan.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.370
Its power was beyond imagination.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.300
Not only that...

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.400
There were six of them who possessed the Rinnegan?!

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.530
How can that even be possible?

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.470
Perhaps, there's a trick to it.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.970
Most likely, only Jiraiya-boy, who was there,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.300
discovered their secret.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.530
But...

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:25.900
Jiraiya-boy!

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:33.370
Even after he had his throat crushed by Pain,

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.130
Jiraiya-boy left a message before collapsing.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.370
This is that message!

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.370
It's a code...

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.470
I'm sure he did this to prevent Pain from noticing.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.830
I've told you everything about Jiraiya-boy.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.700
I wonder what Jiraiya wanted to say.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:07.030
If we can decode this... we'll understand, won't we?

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.070
Did you...let him go, Granny?

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.600
That's right.

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.230
Why'd you allow such a reckless thing?!

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.300
You knew Pervy Sage better than anyone!

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.300
How could you send him to such a dangerous place, alone?!

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.330
Enough, Naruto.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.170
You of all people ought to know Lady Hokage's feelings.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.330
It's too dangerous to go alone!

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.130
I am one of the Legendary Sannin of the Leaf.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.770
You know what that means as well.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.300
You were beautiful back then...

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.370
and now, you're a fifty-something old granny.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.270
It pains me to see how all the memories

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.800
of your lost friends and loved ones are stored inside that big breast of yours.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.530
And you know, the number will continue to grow.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.070
However...I guess I shouldn't wallow in sadness.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.130
My duty is to be a model for the next generation

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:21.800
and to help them out.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.230
For that, I'd happily give my life.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.730
It's what makes us old folks cool, see?

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.300
Damn it!

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.300
Naruto!

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.400
Where are you going?!

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.500
If Pervy Sage had been the Fifth Hokage...

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.930
he wouldn't have let Granny Tsunade take such risks... Never!

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.130
Naruto!

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.930
Sakura... It's all right. Let him be.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.900
But...

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.500
My apologies, Lord Fukasaku.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.570
I'll arrange for Naruto to...

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.030
No... That's all right.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.800
About the Child of Prophecy I mentioned earlier...

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:18.500
I can see that child truly loved and admired Jiraiya-boy.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:24.730
I can't help but hope that he is the Child of Prophecy.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.630
I will now teach you... the Summoning Jutsu!

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:35.930
This is it!

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:40.900
Summoning Jutsu!

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.330
Whoa!

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.530
Huh?!

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.770
Why? Why?!

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.600
Why do I have to go with the Pervy Sage on a research trip?!

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.430
It's not just a research trip.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.600
There's a woman I want to research and I must find her.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.430
Say! Say! Why did you choose me?

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.830
Long ago... I taught the Fourth Hokage.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.900
And you have an uncanny resemblance to him.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.030
I don't waste any time.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.130
During the journey, you will have my undivided attention.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.200
Me?

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.000
It's time to make you strong... to train you!

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:41.700
The boy wanders the village in despair,

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.300
reminiscing about the memories with his late Master.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.900
The end of his childhood days approaches...

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:55.330
When all his grief is let out, the boy will rise up once again.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.370
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Following the Master's Shadow"

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.170
After all, we can't stay brats forever.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.500
Tune in again!
