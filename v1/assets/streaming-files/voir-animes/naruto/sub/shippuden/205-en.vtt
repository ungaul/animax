00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.140
Two-Man Team

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.270
Damned Naruto! He pulled out the rod!

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.430
In that case…

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.480
Rasengan!

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.310
You did it!

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.180
What?! Why are the chains still here?!

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.980
Heh… I guess this chain through my belly won't disappear…

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.680
Why?! I pulled out the rod, just like you said.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.930
That rod just temporarily binds my chakra to the Jinchuriki's body.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.350
But my chakra itself is held by that masked guy

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.480
through the Gedo Statue.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.810
You knew about that?!

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.060
Then it means that I haven't saved you!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.980
You… You're seriously saying that for real…?

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.140
Of course I am!

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.680
This kid…. He really is serious…

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.930
I only told you how to stop me.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.390
I never told you how to save me.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.100
You should have told me that from the beginning!

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.140
Why aren't Tailed Beasts more straightforward?!

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.270
So what do I have to do?!

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.680
Before I tell you, I have something to pass on to you.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.100
What is it?

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.560
Hold out your hand…

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.600
Huh? You're giving me something?

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.230
It's something good.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.020
It will come in handy one of these days. Hurry up!

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.770
What?!

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.140
The statue reabsorbed Four Tails! I guess he still belongs to him!

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.270
You look like you're about to pass out

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.390
after stopping just one Tailed Beast…

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.730
You can't defy me!

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.560
I'm going to take your precious Tailed Beast with these…

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.060
What's going on?!

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.100
This is bad, no matter how you look at it.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.430
And you're a mess.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.180
Idiot. Just watch me…

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.230
If you want me to lend you power, I wouldn't mind doing it, Naruto.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.600
You sure are talking to me a lot, lately.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.390
I'm glad you want to lend me power,

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.140
but before you do, there's something I have to say.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.140
Thanks for helping me with the other Madara back there.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.850
That extra power really saved me!

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.270
Don't thank me! It's creeping me out!

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.850
I just did that because I'd rather deal with you than Madara!

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.770
Besides, I could only give you a tiny bit of chakra

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.390
because of this cage!

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.980
I just wanted to see you fight a little more!

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.020
That's right…

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.180
Just to pass the time!

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.140
Hey! Why do have to get mad when I just thanked you?

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.270
You don't have to stop glaring at me,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.270
but you could at least work on your attitude!

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.230
You're always like—?!

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.850
Hit your chakra with mine…

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.640
Are we going to play chakra tug-of-war again?

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.270
You idiot… We don't need to do that this time!

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.890
It's not like I have anything else to do.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.560
So we could if you really wanted to.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.730
Let's do this, Octopops!

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.640
We fight as a two-man team with me taking the lead.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.810
Naruto, you just be my back up, agreed?

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.350
Even so, we're going up against five Tailed Beasts.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680
You can't be in the front

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.140
if you can't do a Tailed Beast Transformation!

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.680
Both you and Eight-o are hurt,

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.600
so there isn't going to be any leading or backing up!

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.180
We're going in together!

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.100
Hey… Naruto!

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.980
Especially since we're both already in two-man teams…

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.520
Hold on, Naruto… Don't tell me… You and the Nine Tails…

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.430
I've still got tons of reserve power!

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.930
You don't approve of me!

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.770
I don't approve of the monster fox…

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.230
But, not Naruto…

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.310
For him, I have nothing but respect.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.560
He's an excellent student…

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.310
He works with all his might.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.930
But despite that, he's clumsy and not everyone approves of him.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.270
He already knows about the pain in peoples' hearts.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.730
That boy is no longer the demon fox.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.810
He is…a citizen of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.680
He's Naruto Uzumaki.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.980
You're no longer the monster fox…

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.480
You are a partner of a citizen from the Hidden Leaf…

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560
Kurama!

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.230
Come on, let's do this!

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.920
Naruto… Don't tell me you…

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.080
Th-This is really bad!

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.710
Guy, don't move!

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.380
I'm going to blow them away with my left eye with Kamui!

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.000
There's so many of them!

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.540
It's impossible with Visual Prowess alone!

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.460
In that case, I'll open up the Eight Gate…

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.630
You idiot! You'll die after you do that!

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.830
But still…

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.080
Naruto! Looks like they're in trouble over there!

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.790
There are five Tailed Beast Bombs pointed at them at close range!

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.750
I know about it…y'know!

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.790
What was that?! So fast!

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.170
S-Sensei?!

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.750
I-Is that, Naruto?!

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.920
The mountain…

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.080
So this is the power of the Tailed Beasts!

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.130
He deflected them all?!

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.500
In that case…

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.380
Here they come!

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.040
Let's go, Kurama!

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.830
Was Naruto able to do Tailed Beast Transformation?

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.540
That Nine Tails…

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.040
What's going on?!

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.000
Are we inside the Nine Tails' chakra?!

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.250
First, we have to figure out where all of their rods are!

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.210
Just to let you know, we don't have much time here.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.330
This is our first Tailed Beast Transformation,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.460
so our link isn't perfect.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.790
We can only keep this up for about five minutes!

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.130
That's more than enough time.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.630
There are more of you,

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.380
so I can't be as gentle as I was with Son.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.170
So please bear with it, okay?

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.210
I'm not falling for that same trick twice!

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.170
Take this!

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.040
All right! I found out where they all are!

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.670
This is like an all-out monster smack down!

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.000
He exceeded my expectations.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.080
I'll have to go after him with intent to kill.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.000
Hey… Don't you think that's pretty big for one of those things?

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.210
Are they pooling their power into a single point?!

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.670
Naruto, what now?!

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.080
Is he going to cancel it out with equal force?!

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.920
But Naruto's never succeeded at that before…

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.540
He managed to do it by accident during training,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.040
but this time, he'll do it for sure.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.000
– Tailed Beast Bomb! – Tailed Beast Bomb!

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.250
He aimed it low, so it would bounce them upwards.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.000
That was good… but it was really big!

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.500
Nine Tails sure is strong…

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.380
I've got all their rods!

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.420
Let's do this, Kurama!

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.080
We're going to pull them out all at once!

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:49.830
We're going to free them all! And definitely save everyone!

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.170
We've been waiting for you.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.170
Huh?

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.000
The same thing happened with Son.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:08.420
You did get all the way to this plane… just as Four Tails said.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.540
This isn't where Four Tails was…

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.000
Now that we're fully linked,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.170
you're able to enter deeper into the Tailed Beast Psyche Plane.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.830
Look! There are Jinchuriki here too!

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.330
Also, Four Tails was bound by Chakra Chains.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.830
I don't really get it,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.670
but everyone's here and there aren't any chains.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.040
It's not as crazy as last time!

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.040
That jerk in the mask cannot penetrate this deep.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.040
Welcome!

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.000
I thank you on behalf of all of us Jinchuriki and Tailed Beasts.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.830
I've wanted to meet you, Naruto Uzumaki!

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.830
To tell you the truth…huh?

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.790
You look like you're shorter, younger and weaker than me.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.170
You must have had it rough as a Jinchuriki.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.290
Knowing how you went through that…

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:08.130
And how you've already passed on… It's just so sad.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.670
You never knew the taste of good ramen…

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.630
or what it felt like to kiss a girl!

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.170
– Hey! You've never kissed a girl either! – I am the Former Fourth Mizukage!

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.960
– Hey! You've never kissed a girl either! – I was quite distinguished!

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.580
– Actually… – And I'm an adult!

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.750
you've only kissed Sasuke.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.210
No! Don't make me remember that!

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.040
Hey, you're barfing way too much!

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.170
What was it like to kiss this Sasuke?!

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.130
I'm talking to you!

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.080
Honestly, just as Four Tails said, you don't listen at all!

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.710
Four Tails?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.040
So, Son was here too?

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.080
That's right…

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.500
Finally…

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.080
So does that mean that bearded old man was here too?

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.210
Yup!

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.080
Make sure to tell him…

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.420
Also, I was able to give him just a tiny bit of my chakra.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.250
Do you remember what Old Man Six Paths told us at the very end?

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.130
I think this kid's it…

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.630
That's what I felt.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.830
I wager he'll probably come here to save all of you too.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.750
Look after that kid when he does.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.210
I'm being pulled back into the statue…

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.580
Goodbye for now, guys.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.290
Four Tails… This is just hypothetical, but…

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.880
Do you think we could have traveled down a different path too?

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.500
This coming from you,

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.460
who's even more stubborn than Tsuchikage Ohnoki?

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.630
Have you gone soft after death?

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.170
Well… maybe if you had tried to remember my name,

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.290
right when you became my Jinchuriki…

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.000
I haven't softened enough to start calling you by your name,

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.830
after being your Jinchuriki for over forty years…

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.040
But I haven't forgotten it either!

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.130
In that case, say my full name, spiel and all.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.830
Is just "Son" good enough?

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.040
We assembled here on Four Tails' summons…

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.750
and hung around after promising to tell, and give you, something.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.920
I see… He did all that?

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.000
I'm glad that you're all gathered together and getting along!

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:54.170
That only happened after Four Tails and Roshi left here.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.460
It's all thanks to you, Naruto.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.290
Naruto, step forward and extend your hand…

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.080
We shall now fulfill our promise to Four Tails…rather Son Goku.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.040
My name is Matatabi.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.540
Yugito Ni'i…

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.710
My name is Isobu. We've met before, huh!

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.170
I'm Yagura, the former Fourth Mizukage.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.210
I am Kokuo.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.290
I'm Han.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.460
Me, I be called Saiken.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.210
You already know me, I'm Utakata.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.170
I'm Luck Seven Chomei.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.500
I'm Fu!

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.210
I will not live much longer…

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:03.750
Shukaku, Matatabi, Isobu, Son Goku, Kokuo,

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.710
Saiken, Chomei, Gyuki, and Kurama…

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.880
Even if you are far apart, you will always be together.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.880
There will come a time when you will be united again.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.250
Each of you with a unique name…. and a different form than before.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.080
And unlike when you were inside me,

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.000
you will be guided down the right path.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.670
I hope you learn what true strength is…

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.080
Before that time…

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.210
It's taken way too long, Old Man.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.790
Don't you all agree? That Naruto's the Old Man's…

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:58.960
Yes!

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.500
Yup!

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:03.750
Yeah!

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.170
Indeed…

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.790
For sure…

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.330
Well done, Naruto!

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.210
I never thought you'd be able to completely control Nine Tails.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.170
However, it looks like you still can't maintain it for too long.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.960
So same old, same old.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.830
It's not the same old, same old…

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.880
I just learned a whole bunch of hard names all at once!

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.250
Naruto gaining such experience and strength

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.130
makes me feel old and feeble.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.380
You're not being yourself!

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.130
The springtime of our youth is still far from over!

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.380
We still have a lot of…

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.130
Quiet! Do you want to make me feel even worse?

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.920
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Promise of Victory"

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.330
That's the Guy I know!

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:08.960
THE PROMISE OF VICTORY Tune in again!
