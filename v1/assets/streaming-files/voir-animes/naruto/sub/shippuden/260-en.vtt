WEBVTT

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.500
There's a full moon out tonight, Sasuke.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.880
What…?

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.170
Come on out…

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.420
Nine Tails!

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.170
Itachi's Story - Light and Darkness: The Genius

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.130
What is this sensation?

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.420
There, there…

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.050
Don't cry, Sasuke.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.300
No matter what happens, your big brother will definitely protect you…

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.710
Summoning Jutsu!

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.050
No way!

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.090
Go, Nine Tails!

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.920
It's okay. There, there!

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.840
It's the Nine Tails!

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.550
The Demon Fox is on the loose!

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.460
What's going on?!

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.210
Just run, you idiot!

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.960
Sasuke!

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.130
It's okay. You got a little scared, huh?

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.090
This is an announcement from the Leaf Police!

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.920
All civilians are to evacuate to the southeast shelter!

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.130
The southeast shelter!

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.800
Dad! Mom!

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.210
Come here!

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.340
Itachi!

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.840
Hurry!

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.840
Okay!

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.500
We're going to the shelter.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.420
This way! Hurry!

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.670
Mom!

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.880
Keep going.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.750
Itachi?

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.460
Everyone will be there.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.960
Please stay calm!

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.050
You're safe here!

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.300
Father!

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.380
I knew you would be all right.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.960
Get to the shelter quickly.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.210
Okay.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.170
We drove it out of the village.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.250
Don't let up. Keep attacking!

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.090
Just about everyone has been evacuated.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.550
Captain, we'll go after the Nine Tails as well.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.630
The Leaf Police Force is to remain and protect the civilians.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.590
But Captain!

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.960
These are the Village's orders.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.880
What was that just now?!

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.590
Looks like they sealed the Nine Tails…

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.460
…somehow.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.250
Many lives were lost

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.960
including the Fourth Hokage Minato and his wife, Kushina…

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.630
The facts behind the incident are still unknown…

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.090
Life is born…

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.920
But for now, let us mourn our comrades…

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.130
And life…dies.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.050
Itachi!

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.750
Thank you for before…

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.130
Because of you, I was safe!

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.840
I'm glad you didn't die.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.250
Your younger sister?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.050
Younger brother.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.750
Can I hold him?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
No.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.380
Why not?

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.670
I don't want him to cry.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.460
You're not gonna cry, are you?

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.340
There, there!

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.090
There, there!

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.800
There, there!

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.380
Aww, come on!

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.000
The Nine Tails' attack caused devastation throughout the village.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:26.960
For the reconstruction,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.250
we've decided to revise a number of the village's boundaries.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.460
We'd like the Aburame Clan to move into this district.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.670
The clan previously submitted a request to occupy the forest,

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.210
so we took that into consideration.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.090
The Nara Clan's territory was not part of the stricken area,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.420
so they will remain where they are.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.710
The Leaf Police Force headquarters which sustained damage,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.000
will be rebuilt here.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.750
And the Uchiha Clan will move along with the headquarters…

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.000
Lord Danzo!

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.050
The Uchiha Clan makes up the Leaf Police Force

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.420
that protects the Hidden Leaf.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.920
As such, that location is too far from the village center.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.920
We wouldn't be able to act swiftly in an emergency.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.750
We have the ANBU Black Ops for such emergencies.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:18.420
The Leaf Police has to commute to the training grounds, does it not?

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.960
This location is near an area that's ideal for training.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.050
You can use that area exclusively for the Uchiha's training grounds.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.670
Continuing on…

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.170
In conjunction with the reconstruction of the Leaf Police Headquarters,

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.710
the Uchiha Clan will also relocate.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.630
Home and buildings that were spared will be…

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.750
During the Nine Tails Incident,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.050
we Uchiha were not called upon because they feared that

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.210
we would use our Sharingan to manipulate the Nine Tails.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.250
Even worse, there are some who say

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.800
that the Uchiha caused the Nine Tails Incident!

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.250
They are sending us to the outskirts of the village in order to keep an eye on us!

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.710
This is just like during the Second Hokage's era

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.920
when the Uchiha were rounded up and isolated in one part of the village!

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.960
This time, it's even farther away!

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.090
The village suspects us!

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.050
Captain, we can't accept this decision!

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.630
We should reject it outright!

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.590
Captain!

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.960
You are absolutely right.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.050
But the other clans have accepted their respective relocations as well.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.800
The Uchiha cannot be the lone voice of dissent.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.210
But Captain!

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.420
I'll do what I can to negotiate the conditions.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.630
But we must accept the move.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.170
Pass the word around. That is all.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.130
Dismissed.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.050
How do you feel?

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.300
Let's go and see it, Father.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.000
The new training grounds.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.550
I like it here.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.000
Is that so?

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.090
Father, teach me jutsu…

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.050
Generational Uchiha Jutsu… through the generations.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.250
All right!

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.090
This is a fundamental Uchiha Ninjutsu…

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.800
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.000
All right, the signs are…

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:26.960
I did it!

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.250
What a surprise.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.460
That's my boy.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.050
We'll be moving in no time, huh?

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.920
Yeah.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.920
What's the matter?

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.000
We're surrounded…

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.960
I wish it was my imagination, but…

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.210
What is it?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It's nothing…

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.000
"In no time," huh? The same could be said about you, Itachi.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.420
Since you're going to be six years old soon.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.840
CONGRATULATIONS ON ENTERING THE ACADEMY

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.530
Congratulations on your acceptance into the Academy, everyone!

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.450
From this day forth,

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.900
do your best to reach your goals to become a shinobi.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:48.530
I'm sure some of you have already been taught ninjutsu in your households…

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.650
But here at the Academy, you will also train

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.030
to coordinate and work together as a team when you are in a group.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.700
The fundamentals are very important, make sure you learn them well.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.530
All right, Kamano. What's the answer?

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.570
I don't know!

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.700
Then…Itachi?

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.820
The seal is for the Water Style: Water Bomb Jutsu.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.490
Correct.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.320
Keep that in mind everyone.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.650
It will be on the test.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.610
Itachi…Come at me.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.820
All right!

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.530
Begin!

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.360
The match is over!

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.950
Okay, okay…

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.360
Sorry, Sasuke. Some other time, okay?

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.360
Welcome home, Father!

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.780
Please teach me jutsu!

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.490
Jutsu?

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.740
Aren't they teaching you at the Academy?

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.860
It's too easy.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.700
I guess it would be for you.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.990
Wait for me at the training grounds.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.320
Okay!

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:43.900
Make sure you're home by dinner.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.400
Got it!

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.360
Look over there! It's Itachi!

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.280
Where?

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.030
Oh, he's walking. He's so cool!

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.150
Oh, he's looking this way!

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.530
This is not good.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.650
Don't you think, gentlemen?

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.860
For his sake,

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.450
if he gets swept up by all of this and gets the wrong idea…

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.070
I agree.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.360
He's stuck up!

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.700
It's me! He's looking at me!

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.450
No, it's me!

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:13.740
He started walking again!

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.200
Itachi's walking!

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.030
He's walking!

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:21.990
It's decided then…

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.530
- Yeah! - Right!

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.490
Ouch!

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.650
Don't jump out at us like that, idiot!

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.490
"Idiot"? Who are you calling "idiot"?

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.740
You guys must be freshmen!

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:55.780
You…

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.610
…run into someone…

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.530
and call 'em an "idiot"…?

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.450
You ran into us!

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.110
What did you say?!

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.530
Hold it!

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.780
Who the hell are you?

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.110
A friend of theirs?

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.700
All the freshmen this year are…

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.740
…stuck up!

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.780
- Wow! - Wow!

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.780
Take him to the infirmary.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.650
O-Okay.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.990
Itachi, you're really strong, my friend!

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.530
"My friend"?

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.110
Even upperclassmen are easy targets for you, sir!

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:02.360
"Sir"?

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.860
Move it, move it!

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.070
Master Itachi is coming through!

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:07.490
"Master"?

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.780
Make way!

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.110
It's Master Itachi!

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.570
- Move it! Make way! - Stop it…

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.950
- Outta the way! - Please…

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.990
Don't…

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.400
There is birth…

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.280
and death…

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400
Life…

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.740
flocks together…

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.570
SHINOBI

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.320
What is a shinobi?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.490
What is a village?

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.320
First in every class, according to your progress report…

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.200
That's my boy.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:50.900
Father…

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.320
Hmm?

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:53.950
Teach me jutsu.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.280
I want to know more about being a shinobi.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.070
In cases like this, always make sure you have an escape route.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.450
This is important. If you're in a four-man team…

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.820
You're very talented for your age.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.570
I'm no match for you, Shisui.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.780
Oh come on…

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.530
What's wrong?

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.860
Does the Academy bore you so much that you're ditching?

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.860
I'm not ditching.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.360
You guys! That's unfair!

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.530
What's with that look?

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.860
Hey! Cut it out!

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.530
Hey you, stop!

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:29.900
Itachi!

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.530
Take this!

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.700
What happened?

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.200
He disappeared?!

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.740
Yeah, he disappeared! He disappeared!

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.610
That's a clone…

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.110
No…

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.030
It's a Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.400
What's the matter?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.400
I have to get back.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.200
You do?

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.320
Shisui…

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.400
Why is there fighting in life?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.360
Who knows?

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.570
But…

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.490
If the fighting can be stopped, I'd like to stop it.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.280
Me too!

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:30.530
See you later.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.030
Aside from the clone jutsu

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.320
which is a requirement for graduating the Academy,

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.650
Itachi Uchiha has already mastered the Shadow Clone Jutsu, a forbidden jutsu.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.450
He excels in all other subjects.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.740
There's no purpose in keeping him at the Academy any longer.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.570
Isn't he just a freshman?

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:50.490
Yes.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.400
That doesn't matter. This has happened before.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.110
That was a different era.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.530
This is not the age of war.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.280
The boy is a genius, no?

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.610
I've never seen a student like him.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.200
So it will be better for Itachi to let him graduate?

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.740
Graduate?

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.490
After only a year at the Academy?

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:14.700
Yeah.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.400
The teacher said as long as both parents agree.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.900
They want to talk to you at school.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.950
I see…

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.400
That's my boy.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.320
GRADUATES' INFORMATION SESSION Graduates!

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.900
You will now be assigned missions from the village.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:52.530
We'll be forming three-man teams led by one jonin…

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.450
and you will be undertaking your mission under their guidance.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.900
And now, I will announce the teams!

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.220
Big Brother! What is this?

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.300
This is…from back then!

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.720
Life is born, and life dies…

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.140
But life is saved again…

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.260
Well…

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.640
When I saved them back then, I didn't really have any deep feelings.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.350
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Pain of Living"

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:03.130
It just affected me…

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.800
Itachi's Story - Light and Darkness: The Pain of Living

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:17.800
Tune in again!
