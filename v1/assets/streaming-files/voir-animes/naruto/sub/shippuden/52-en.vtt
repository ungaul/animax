00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.070
The Power of Uchiha

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.870
I have different bonds...

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.430
Bonds of hatred with my older brother...

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.530
Numerous bonds...

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.770
mislead oneself...

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.530
and weaken the most important desires...

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.670
and cherished memories.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.300
Have you finally opened your eyes...Sasuke?!

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.000
Shut up.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.400
You don't even have parents or siblings...

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.070
What do you know about me?!

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.430
You've been alone from the start!

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.200
What do you know about me?! Huh?!

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.400
It's having the bond that makes it painful!

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.130
You've no idea what it's like... to lose that!

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:15.930
You're right.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.270
I don't know about having real parents or siblings...

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.600
If that's the case, then why...?

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.430
Why, Naruto...?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.330
Why do you go so far for me...?

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.970
To me, it's a bond...I've finally been able to establish.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.200
That's why I'll stop you!

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.330
Why didn't you...

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.630
I can't turn back...

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.330
Then I'll just break that bond!

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.200
Why didn't you kill me back then?!

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.970
You think that could break our bond, Sasuke?!

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.770
Naruto...

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.130
The reason's simple...

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.400
It's not that I couldn't break the bond with you...

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.500
You're one...

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.530
who might be able to use the same Mangekyo Sharingan as mine...

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.730
However, there's a condition.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.370
You must kill...

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.900
your closest friend.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.530
That's...!

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.400
It was just irritating to me.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.800
Obtaining power based on the method he told me.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.730
What do you mean?!

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.900
It's not necessary to explain that to you.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.000
What I can say to you is...

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.830
Back then...

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.730
Chidori!

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.630
Rasengan!

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.370
- Rasengan! - Chidori!

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.870
Naruto...

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.970
I...

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.770
Back then...

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:54.400
You're only alive because of my passing whim.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.970
He's fast!

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.230
When did he...?

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.200
Come to think of it,

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.500
wasn't it your dream to become the Hokage...?

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.270
If you had the time to be chasing after me,

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.370
you should've spent that time training or something.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.230
Right, Naruto?

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:42.970
S-Sasuke...!

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.400
And so this time around... you'll lose your life...

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.200
because of my passing whim.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.570
No way can a guy who can't even save one friend...

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.430
become the Hokage.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.900
Isn't that right, Sasuke?

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.230
Sasuke!

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.470
That manner of defense...

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.030
was correct.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.970
All right!

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.900
Chidori Stream!

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.400
He's unleashing Chidori from his entire body...!

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.030
Sorry, Naruto...

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.530
You'll have to wait a while...

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.930
Next time, I promise...

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.300
I won't be a burden.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.330
I'll stop Sasuke...

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.970
with my own power!

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.870
Those eyes. This guy's bad news.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.700
Captain Yamato!

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.430
That manner of defense...

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.130
was a mistake.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.700
This Snake Sword of mine is somewhat special, you see.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.970
It's impossible to guard.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.500
My body is getting numb...

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:26.900
This is...

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.930
Is he sending a Chidori through the blade...?

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:36.530
I get it... It paralyzes you with numbness after cutting...

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.130
on top of increasing the cutting quality to the extreme...

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.200
It appears... things have gotten interesting.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.030
Now's your chance, Naruto...

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.770
Show him...our...

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.200
powers.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.930
What's the matter...?

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.100
Why do you hesitate...?

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.570
You need my power, don't you?

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.700
Now then...

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.630
Who do you want to kill...?

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.730
Don't...come out anymore!

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.570
What're you afraid of?

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.200
Shut up...!

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.000
I don't need anything like your power anymore!

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.830
Who was the one who had the nerve...

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.670
to ask for my help at every opportunity?

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:48.500
You should know that you can't do anything on your own.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.830
Break the Seal completely!

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:58.300
I'll grant you all of my powers if you do.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.870
Get lost!

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.170
You...

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.570
I see... So you're an Uchiha...

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.170
My, how you've grown...

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.000
What're you doing here...?

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:27.970
I can see it now...

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.300
So this is your unknown power, huh...?

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.470
Who would've thought...

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.100
you'd have something like this inside of you...

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:43.430
To think you'd become able to see me within Naruto...

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.970
That dreadful Sharingan...

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.270
So that's the power of the cursed clan, huh?

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.700
It seems this isn't the first time you've seen the Sharingan.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.630
Then...

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.600
you must be the Nine-Tailed Fox, huh...?

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.930
That vision, and Chakra more ominous than mine...

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.730
It's just like...

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.300
the Madara Uchiha from olden times...

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.700
Uchiha...

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.630
Hell if I know...that person.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.630
I never thought...

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.830
you would go so far as to suppress my power...

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.900
This might be the end...

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.370
But let me tell you...one thing...

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.930
Don't...kill...Naruto...

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.930
You'll...

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.130
regret...it...

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.600
Wood Style: Domed Wall!

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.400
Sasuke...

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.000
Looks like it's meaningless...

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.770
to try and convince Sasuke further than this.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.130
Captain Yamato...

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.430
We can't let a Shinobi who left the village...

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.830
roam free forever, you see.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.530
I really didn't want to take any rough measures...

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.500
because of you two watching, but...

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.870
What do you intend to do?

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.770
We'll bring him into the Leaf with any means we can.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.230
Sorry, but I'm going to go all out from here.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.400
Next time: "Title"
