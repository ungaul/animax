WEBVTT

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.330
This is not good.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.600
It's over...

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.900
Just what you'd expect from Lord Kazekage!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.730
Yeah. This village will be safe

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.430
as long as we have Lord Kazekage!

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.930
Hold on!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.430
This sand's such a pain in the neck.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.970
You fool...!

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.000
Do you really think

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.470
you can get away from Gaara's sand?!

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.600
The Kazekage Stands Tall! 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.600
I never thought this would be my reason for losing...

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.470
I should've just gone ahead and finished the book...

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.300
But how can you even read such a boring book?!

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.330
Huh?

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.430
The Pervy Sage loaned it to me,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.800
but it was so boring I didn't even make it ten pages.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.970
So of course, I don't know how the book ends.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.630
Even without Naruto knowing the ending of the book...

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.700
we figured you'd respond if we mentioned the name,

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.530
"Make-Out Tactics."

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.930
Pretty good strategy, huh?

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.500
You two certainly showed me some growth.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.930
Master!

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.530
Kakashi, do you have something to say?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.400
Well, they did a great job taking the bells away from me, so...

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.800
Yes.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.500
What're you talking about?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.170
We're talking about your status for the future.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.200
Our status...?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.230
- Naruto Uzumaki! - Huh?

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.430
Answer me.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.770
Y-Yeah!

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.170
Sakura Haruno!

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.000
Yes!

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.800
The two of you and... Kakashi Hatake...

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.830
The three of you shall form Team Kakashi!

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.930
Team Kakashi... S-Say, what does that mean?

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.200
The two of you will form a team with me

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.170
and we'll carry out missions together.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.870
That's what this means.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.500
It's not like the old days.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.470
We're no longer teacher and students.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.130
We will work together as equal Leaf Shinobi. Got it?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.330
Sure! I got it!

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.200
Kankuro!

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.700
Is Lord Gaara fighting right now?! Where is he?

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.870
Yeah.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.400
He's up there...

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.070
Gaara...

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.800
Sand Coffin...

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.270
He did it... - He did it! - Yeah!

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.400
Lord Kazekage is amazing!

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.200
Did he get away...?!

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.770
That guy sure is lucky...!

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.870
Not bad.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.600
I get it.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.930
The sand he used to crush my hand

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.330
is much faster and more powerful

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.470
 than ordinary sand taken from the desert...

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.670
According to our information...

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.730
He always carries with him a fixed amount of sand...

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.570
In other words,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.400
only that sand has been... specially created

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.530
with a large amount of Chakra built up inside...

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.270
That's the sand he uses for quick defense...

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.170
as well instant attacks.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.430
What did they call it again...?

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.300
I remember now!

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.670
It's the "Ultimate Defense"

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.500
That's the "Ultimate Defense" sand...

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.670
In other words,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:55.230
the sand from that hole is what crushed my arm...

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.800
I've only got a little bit of clay left...

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.370
I underestimated him...

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.570
What you'd call "not prepared enough."

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.730
This is just as the good man Sasori said...

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.370
Will just that bag be enough?

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.730
Our opponent will be using the Jinchuriki...

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.900
I've only enough left for one more homing-type...

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.970
and my specialty as well.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.200
I think...

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.030
I'll destroy this village, after all.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.130
For crying out loud...

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.430
How long is that Deidara going to make me wait?

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.200
I told him I don't like waiting...

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.570
Lord Kazekage...

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.800
Black clothing and a red cloud pattern...!

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.870
Judging from that appearance,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.570
the enemy Lord Kazekage is fighting against

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.900
is likely a member of the organization called the "Akatsuki."

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.030
I knew it.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:53.930
Kankuro.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.500
What is it?

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.400
Gaara's even using his "Ultimate Defense" sand

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.470
in this fight.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.600
I think it's safe to assume the enemy is a formidable one.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.070
For the time being,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.630
we need to consider that Gaara could lose control.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.470
We need to be ready in case Shukaku appears.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.300
The villagers will be in danger.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.000
That won't happen anymore.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.000
Gaara will not harm the people of this village.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.830
Never!

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.530
Gaara, give it up.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.600
I don't want to say this,

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.100
but you're nothing but a frightening weapon to the village...

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.900
It'll just be a struggle for you

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.570
to join a regular unit at this point.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.670
The superiors don't think well of you.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.730
And a majority of the village is scared of you.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.230
I know that...

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.470
I know that...

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.700
but I will be overcome with an even greater suffering

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.530
if I just wait around...

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.370
I just have to work hard and carve out a future for myself.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.970
And I must not run away from my path of solitude.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.070
If I do that, someday...

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.300
Someday...I can be like him...

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.700
So as a Sand Shinobi,

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.970
I will strive to become the Kazekage.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.270
To live...bonded with this village.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.470
Gaara...

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.730
I want to work hard... and be acknowledged by others.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.170
Naruto Uzumaki made me believe that...

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.200
Having bonds with others...

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.300
I only knew hate and malice up until now.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.570
But now, there's something I understand about those bonds.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.730
He went so far to tell me about.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.300
I understand that pain, sadness...and happiness...

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.430
can be shared with others.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.830
Naruto Uzumaki...

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:44.870
I learned that through fighting and getting to know him.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.030
He knew of the same pain as me.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:54.770
And he taught me that I could change the path of my life.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:01.030
Someday, I want to feel needed by someone.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.570
Not as a frightening weapon...

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.270
but as the Kazekage of the Hidden Sand Village.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.770
There are people who need you.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.000
You're the Kazekage of the Hidden Sand!

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.730
Lord Gaara!

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.530
Lord Kazekage! Hang in there!

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.670
Gee, you guys sure got strong.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.900
I never thought you'd really be able to get the bells...

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.700
I just might've surpassed you, Kakashi Sensei.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.070
Why're you talking all big?!

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.600
Well, but I'm still pretty young, you see...

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.400
The other day, I developed an incredible new Jutsu...

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.100
And it's pretty incredible, you see...

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.530
Oh, that's right.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.030
I haven't had any Ichiraku ramen since I got back!

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.870
Oh, I'm also pretty hungry

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.000
from all that training exercise since yesterday.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.700
All right! Let's make a beeline for Ichiraku Ramen!

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:15.530
Right!

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:25.000
They used to be so cute and react to everything back in the day...

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.430
As promised, I leave Naruto in your care.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.300
It's my first Ichiraku ramen in ages!

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.930
It'll be Kakashi Sensei's treat!

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.000
- Treat! Treat! - Treat! Treat!

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.230
The actions of the Akatsuki are gaining momentum...

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.370
I'm heading off to gather information.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.570
See you around.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.170
Kakashi Sensei!

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.070
Huh?

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.500
It's been settled that

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.000
you're going to treat us to some ramen!

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.970
Hurry up!

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.770
Sorry, guys!

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:11.530
I have to create and turn in the unit list for the new team!

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.130
See you.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.430
I'm gone.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.970
Oh! He ran away!

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:19.630
He said something about a unit list...

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.700
but he's probably just wondering what happens next in...his book...

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:24.800
That means...

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.830
Then how about we go on a date, just the two of us?

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.900
That's fine. But you're treating.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:32.670
Oh...

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.000
You could at least pay for half of the ramen...

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:41.800
No way!

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.500
Convene all members for an emergency meeting!

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:49.470
Yes, sir!

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.330
You secure the reservoir. Take two units with you!

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.170
Yes, sir.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.570
Seal off the roads in sector A!

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.300
Yes, sir!

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.600
We must not assume there's only one enemy!

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.900
No matter what happens, maintain preparations for battle.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.330
We must be ready to respond!

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.070
Medical Team!

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.570
Set up a barrier and lead all villagers inside! Hurry!

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.000
There must not be even one casualty! Is that clear?!

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.730
We'll provide full support for Gaara... No...for Lord Kazekage!

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.700
Gaara...

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.230
Interference from below really puts a damper on things...

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.100
And besides...

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.470
I'm tired of looking at your expressionless face.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.570
It's a doll

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.800
molded from detonating clay that's got Chakra

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.130
and clay eaten by my palm mixed together...

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.100
This specialty of mine...

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.570
has C3 Chakra, my most powerful Chakra,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.300
built up inside.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.570
The explosive power is an exquisite work of art

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.900
 that I'm very proud of!

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.900
- What's that? Hey! - Yeah, what the heck is it?

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.730
This is not good! Get back!

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.300
You're too late.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.500
Next time, I will finally develop an ultra cool Jutsu!

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.400
The breathtaking arc begins

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.670
as I take down the Akatsuki organization!

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.470
What sort of nonsense are you coming up with, you idiot!

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.370
Oh, Sakura...

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.330
All you'll do is slurp on some ramen noodles at the corner

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:56.370
after being dumped by me!

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.300
Keep making stuff up, and you'll get caught by the Police Force!

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.600
But I want some of the spotlight too!

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.700
Shut up, Cha!

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:04.830
Next time: "Mission Cleared"
