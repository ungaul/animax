WEBVTT

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.500
A Sand...

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.230
What does this mean?

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.200
I don't know either...

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.300
But...he went missing right around the time Gaara was taken.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.600
Could it be that... he was a spy for the Akatsuki?

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.130
I don't believe it.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.970
He served on the council for four years...

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.700
Was he disguised with the Transformation Jutsu?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.130
No.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.970
This is a Jutsu of a much greater level...

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.930
The Fire Ball Jutsu was created by the Uchiha Clan

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.770
and they use it a lot by preference...

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.700
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.000
And that Jutsu was the real thing.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.600
It looks like you're done as well.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.730
Yes... I'm out of Chakra...

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.130
Well, the Chakra we sacrificed was only about thirty percent...

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.930
Although it's a Jutsu handy for creating exact duplicates of us,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.870
the quantity of Chakra we gave them wasn't that much.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.900
And the Jutsu they can use are proportionate to that quantity.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.630
But it was more than enough to buy us time.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.270
The Jutsu wore off, huh...?

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.670
However, we were able to buy quite a bit of time...

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.400
This should be enough...

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.670
Well done, Itachi, Kisame.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.600
That's easy to say.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.430
The two who became sacrifices

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.970
and gave up their bodies for your Jutsu...

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.700
were both my subordinates.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.700
You should be the one thanking me...

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.030
With my Impersonation Jutsu,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.200
they were both able to become members of the Akatsuki,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.630
although only for a short time.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.730
It's almost time...

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.930
The Secret of Jinchuriki 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.000
Damn it! This means the real one is in the hideout, huh...?

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.230
I guess we can say his goal was to stall us and to gather information.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.270
Now that we know that, there's no point in hanging around here.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.970
All right! Let's hurry!

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.330
This way!

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.230
Just as I thought...

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.230
They were clearly stalling for time...

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.730
They've sure got a good Jutsu...

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.170
I never realized...you were... fighting against people like this, Naruto.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.970
Using a Jutsu like this to stall us means...

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.930
they're undoubtedly already extracting the Tailed Beast!

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.930
We don't have time. We must save Gaara right away.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.530
- E-Excuse me... - Hm?

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.030
What do you mean... extract the Tailed Beast...?

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.230
It's likely that they're intention is

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.830
to create a new Jinchuriki using the One-Tail, Shukaku.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.570
Jinchuriki...?

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.830
I explained before how the Tailed Beasts possess

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.700
a power beyond human comprehension, didn't I?

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.730
And how each land attempted to use them as military weapons.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.500
The Jinchuriki... is what you might call...

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.330
the one who controls that power.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.630
But earlier you said...

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.900
The Tailed Beasts have immense Chakra,

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.370
and in the world of Ninja were used for military purposes

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.000
by Hidden Villages around the world.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.830
They competed to get their hands on them.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.200
But none was able to control that power which had surpassed human intelligence.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.770
In the end, that is...

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.470
But in the past, there were those who attempted to control that power.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.930
They attempted to control the Tailed Beast...

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.770
by sealing it inside people.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.770
By doing so,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.030
they tried to suppress the extreme power of the Tailed Beast

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.930
and then control that power.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.000
And the ones with the Tailed Beast sealed within them...

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:07.700
in other words, people like Gaara were called the Jinchuriki.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.000
The striking feature of the Jinchuriki is

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.570
how it utilizes unbelievable power by resonating with the "Tailed Beast."

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.070
Including Gaara, there have been three Jinchuriki in the history of the Sand.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.000
I'm counting on you.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.900
So wars were fought often using the Jinchuriki?

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.870
That's right.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.730
Then, the people who've been turned into a Jinchuriki...

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.400
How can the Tailed Beast be extracted?

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.400
What's required is a Sealing Jutsu with the ability...

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.630
to instantaneously balance the power of the Tailed Beast,

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.270
in addition to plenty of time.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.230
But if that's done, the Jinchuriki...

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.630
Don't tell me...

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.000
That's right...

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.230
The Jinchuriki that has his Tailed Beast extracted...

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.100
dies.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.370
The two people I mentioned earlier...

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.670
The Sand Jinchuriki other than Gaara

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.230
both had the Shukaku within them extracted...

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.700
and died as a result.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.370
You're sentimental as always, huh? Sakura...

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.670
Don't worry.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.830
I'll be saving Gaara!

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.330
I-I was concerned...about your...!

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.470
Let's hurry.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:43.600
Naruto...

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.800
It's from Big Sister, huh...?

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.630
You shouldn't be moving yet.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.270
It's not good for you in your condition.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.400
I'm okay.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.270
I can at least walk...

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.070
More importantly, it seems we've been contacted by Granny Chiyo.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.800
I can't just lie around!

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.400
I see... So you've heard, huh?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.230
As it happens, we've learned something terrible from her message.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.570
Yura was a spy?!

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.670
I can't believe it...

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.630
A man who served on the council for four years wouldn't...

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.130
But...now it makes sense.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.000
How the enemy broke through the village defenses that easily.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.670
And I'm sure nobody imagined

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.530
a man in charge of security would be an enemy spy.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.730
Here I thought we had thoroughly checked everyone out

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.770
when Gaara became the Kazekage!

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.300
The person in question might've just been controlled by some kind of Jutsu.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.870
More importantly,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.370
it doesn't say anything about the most crucial thing!

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.400
When's the Kazekage coming back?!

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.130
Having the Kazekage of one of the Five Great Shinobi Lands no less

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.300
kidnapped by some bandits sets a bad example for the other lands!

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:39.470
And it seems one of them is Sasori of the Red Sand!

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.830
It'll be a tremendous disgrace if this gets out to the other lands!

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.200
If it becomes known that the Kazekage is missing,

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.000
who knows when the neighboring lands will intervene.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.000
Our most pressing need is to immediately elect a new Kazekage...

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.170
and make an effort to stabilize the village.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.400
Gaara could still very well come back!

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.400
Well, the fact is...

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.400
it might just be better for the village if he doesn't come back.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.630
What're you getting at?

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.730
Gaara is an unstable monster with the One-Tail inside him.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.830
We thought he would be easier to control if we made him the Kazekage...

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.130
But in the end, there's no telling when he might go out of control.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.800
There's no mistaking he's trouble.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.170
Gaara originally resonated with the One-Tail, Shukaku.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.530
But he's an unstable experiment we can hardly call complete...

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.330
And he's a failed creation who was even once ordered for assassination

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.670
by his own father, the Fourth Kazekage.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:49.800
Right now, some of the younger people just blindly admire him.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.570
But the fact is most of the people in this village are just scared of him...

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.770
and have no expectations of him!

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.230
Just try talking trash like that again!

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.630
I don't care if you are on the council. I won't allow it!

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.970
Stop, Kankuro!

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.770
You're before the statues of the Kazekage!

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.770
This is a holy place!

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:16.830
Kankuro, your anger is understandable.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.770
But there's an element of truth to what he says.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.370
But the fact is...

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.670
this isn't an issue of whether or not Gaara should be trusted.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.130
Something like this happened before a long time ago...

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.000
The Third Kazekage was kidnapped.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.830
There were all kinds of conjecture

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.830
in regards to the whereabouts of the Third Kazekage,

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.000
war broke out and the lands were in chaos...

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.530
If only we paid our attention towards securing the village,

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.470
rather than eagerly searching for the Third Kazekage,

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.770
that wouldn't have happened.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.300
Then why didn't you do that...?

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.830
The Third Kazekage was an exceptionally powerful Kazekage

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.300
in our history.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.930
And most importantly, a body was never found.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:21.070
No one thought someone as powerful as he could have been killed that easily.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.430
Something like that must never happen again!

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.930
That's why...we must consider the best interests of the village!

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.930
So that's why the borders are being secured...

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.900
The village plunged into chaos

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.570
when the enemy broke through our border by seizing the opportunity

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.930
while we were engaged in the search for the Third Kazekage.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.230
Our most pressing need is to secure the borders.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.900
But there was no reason to go out of your way to send Temari...!

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:52.900
Kankuro...

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.200
What're you saying?!

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.200
Originally we were going to have you take on that mission as well!

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.630
But then you get yourself poisoned...!

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.270
If we assign Gaara's siblings to border patrol missions,

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:14.300
the young people won't start talking about nonsense like rescuing Gaara.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.730
Temari was dispatched to a place

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:21.430
that's been infiltrated by the enemy many times in the past.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.830
We needed someone of Jonin rank or higher to go.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.400
I know... But...

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.470
But...

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.070
Gaara's...

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.730
Gaara's...

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.670
my little brother.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:12.870
Zetsu.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.670
Dispose of the two we used for the Impersonation Jutsu.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.300
Understood.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.670
Itachi, tell me about the enemy's number and their features.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.770
They're a four-man squad with Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno,

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.330
and the Nine-Tail Jinchuriki Naruto Uzumaki from the Leaf,

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.100
and Chiyo, the Sand's advisor.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.830
Did he say Granny Chiyo...?

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.370
It seems he's still not quite accustomed to using the Giant Rasengan...

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:14.000
It looks like opening the Gate of Joy has left him quite exhausted...

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.670
Are you okay, Guy Sensei?

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.130
What do you mean?

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.330
I'm always full of energy.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.330
Guy Sensei!

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.870
He's not okay at all!

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.530
It can't be helped. He just used the Asakujaku.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.900
We should rest somewhere...

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.030
That's the place!

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.130
Is there really a point to us guarding this place?

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.500
Orders are orders.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.730
We'll guard in 24-hour shifts as of now.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:10.830
- Yes, ma'am! - Yes, ma'am!

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.770
Stop!

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.570
What is it, Kakashi Sensei?

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.900
We're going to take a short break here.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.770
That's a wise decision.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.900
Why?!

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.100
You're the one who said we don't have time!

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.900
If we waste time taking a break here, Gaara will be...!

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.800
Compared to right before we encountered the fake Itachi,

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.730
our pace has clearly slowed.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.970
He's absolutely right.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:45.770
If we rest up here, ultimately we'll reach our destination faster.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.070
And tomorrow, we might end up fighting the guys...

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.870
who took Gaara.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.570
It's best if we're at full strength.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.730
Fine.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.570
So this is Kisame's, huh...?

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.370
He looks to be worth disposing of...

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.700
Then let's get to it.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:52.830
Right...

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.970
Now the break is over and both teams have started off again.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.970
Team Kakashi has departed from point A and Team Guy from point B.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.670
They are both charging straight for the one finish line.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.400
They say that Guy and Kakashi are called the Eternal Rivals.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.630
I just can't take my eyes off them.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.700
Guy commented before the race that he would definitely win.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:53.770
That was quite memorable.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.870
The two of them are neck and neck as they head for the finish line.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.830
We wait with breathless anticipation to find out

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.370
who will control this punishing race and grab the glory of victory.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.430
