WEBVTT

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.610
They're too strong!

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.530
How are we supposed to…?

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.530
You're right. At this rate…

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.530
Hokage, your fighting is getting sloppy!

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.280
It might not kill you, but keep fighting like that and

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.440
you'll only exhaust yourself.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.530
I'm putting my life on the line for this battle!

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.530
There is no other way!

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.650
Hokage!

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.110
No…

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.940
Damn! How could I…

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.230
have fallen prey to Sharingan Genjutsu?

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.570
Release!

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.150
Thanks, Tsuchikage.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.320
Damn that Ohnoki…

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.400
His wisdom in battle is beginning to show…

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.570
He stopped Susano'o with the Weighted Boulder Jutsu…

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.570
and saved the Raikage.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.110
Stand, my fellow Kage!

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.730
No more weakness!

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.820
Let us look death in the face together!

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.400
We are the Five Kage!

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.070
So choose final words that will not shame your title!

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.650
Remember the battle that we entrusted to Naruto!

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.570
He entrusted this battle to us

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.570
and we swore that we would win, no matter what!

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.940
And there is one more thing…

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.530
We cannot betray the trust of each and every shinobi.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.940
We must be worthy of the title of Kage!

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.570
So the problem is… Ohnoki, after all.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.610
I have no choice but to break his will.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.550
I Will Love You Always More, Princess!

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.010
You don't have to tell me!

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.300
There's not much chakra left!

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.680
We must consider this our last stand.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.840
Particle Style! Boundary Dismantling Jutsu!

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.340
Releasing Susano'o kept me from absorbing the Particle Style…

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.590
I told you the only thing that will work against me are physical attacks.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.760
You think you've eliminated the clones,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.800
and distracted me with the Particle Style?

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.510
It's not just sand!

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.260
If you don't like the sand, just stop absorbing the jutsu!

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.800
But then, the Lightning Water Dragon will paralyze you.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.260
And I'll use that moment to wedge him in with my Particle Style!

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.840
That will give us enough time to seal him away!

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.340
Do you see this?

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.510
This is the full power of the Five Kage!

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.300
I see…

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.630
This truly is worthy of the shinobi who bear the name Kage.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.590
Then I, Madara Uchiha, shall also respond with full power!

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.300
The Five Kage are nothing compared to me.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.130
This is… my Perfect Susano'o!

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.760
It's massive.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.720
Is this…

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.630
the True Susano'o?

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.010
Not quite yet…

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.340
Settle down!

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.720
The big one's chakra has settled down…

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.970
I can't believe the difference in power…

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.760
I can't believe Grandfather fought someone like him!

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.300
I already told you…

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.760
Hashirama was the only one who could stop me.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.050
But he's no longer here.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.510
Though you could say that actually works in your favor.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.720
That's because…

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.380
It's just me…

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.800
So the maps will only need to be redrawn a little.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.430
Impossible! He split the mountain!

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.300
This is…Madara Uchiha…

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.800
Then why back then…?

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.260
Why did you hold back against us?

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.680
What adult goes full force when fighting mere children?

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.010
Besides… Are you finished now?

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.430
We may be stumbling in the dark,

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.300
but we're close to the light at the end of the tunnel!

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.510
Here, of all places…

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.300
This Susano'o is destruction incarnate.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.300
A single stroke of the blade contains enough power

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.340
to smash all things in this universe.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.340
It rivals even the Tailed Beasts!

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.340
Take your philosophy, Five Kage,

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.720
and be crushed and be gone!

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:23.010
Ne, Ushi, Saru, Tora, Tatsu, I… [Rat, Ox, Monkey, Tiger, Dragon, Boar…]

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.340
That's it, huh…

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.630
All right… Ne… [Rat]

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.680
Ushi… [Ox]

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.430
Saru… [Monkey]

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.090
I guess… it won't matter what I say, will it?

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.800
When I saw you… I followed you in order to confirm

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.090
whether or not Tobi and Danzo spoke the truth.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.760
But that wasn't all I confirmed.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.470
When I'm with you, the past comes flooding back.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.430
The feelings I had as a child, of adoration for my big brother.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.260
That's why…

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.220
the closer I get to you and how we used to be back then,

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.510
the more I understand you.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.380
And the more I hate the Leaf Village for causing you so much pain!

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.550
I hate it more than ever!

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.720
I know what you want me to do.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.180
And because you're my big brother, you'll disapprove.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.090
It's because I'm your brother that, no matter what you say,

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.840
you're not going to stop me!

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:57.880
Even if you protect the village now… I will still destroy it someday.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.180
Tora… [Tiger]

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.970
Tatsu… [Dragon]

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.510
Goodbye.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.300
I… [Boar]

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.550
Reanimation Jutsu… Release!

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:19.840
Big Brother…

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.470
Lord Tsuchikage…

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.260
It's unfortunate… But I think this is the end.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.130
Silence, Mizukage!

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.340
I'm not giving up yet!

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.430
What's going on?

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.930
Did something happen to the Jutsu Caster?

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.590
There's still time…

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.050
I feel like my consciousness is slowly fading…

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.590
I need to tell you everything before we part.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.840
There's no need to lie anymore.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.130
The night I left you,

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:21.050
I did do everything Danzo and Tobi told you.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.680
I'll show you…the whole truth.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.340
These are… Itachi's memories!

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.300
It no longer looks like the Uchiha coup d'etat can be prevented.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.010
And if civil war erupts in the Leaf, other nations are certain to invade.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.180
Real war will break out.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.430
When I tried to stop the coup d'etat with the Kotoamatsukami,

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.800
Danzo stole my right eye.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.720
He doesn't trust me.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.720
He intends to protect the village his way,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.510
no matter what it takes or how it looks.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.970
I suspect he'll come after my left eye as well.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.630
So I want to give it to you before he has a chance.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:14.050
Shisui…

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.550
You're the only person I can count on, my best friend.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.130
Please protect this village… and the honor of the Uchiha name.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.800
We cannot allow such a thing!

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.550
If they are going to start a revolution and usurp our power,

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.430
we have no choice but to judge the Uchiha

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.800
as traitors of the Leaf!

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.380
Wait, Koharu.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.510
Don't rush to such a decision.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.470
But Hiruzen, the Uchiha Clan will not be dissuaded.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.800
We must take measures to avoid mayhem.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.050
And that includes innocent children.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.760
Do not say such things before Itachi.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.930
Besides, taking on the Uchiha will be no easy task.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.970
There's got to be some sort of strategy we can use!

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.180
We have no time to waste.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.880
We must strike preemptively.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.010
If we join forces with our respective ANBU Black Ops

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.840
and launch a surprise attack from behind,

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.380
it will be over in no time.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.550
The Uchiha are old comrades in arms.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.550
I want to settle this with words first before force.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.340
I will come up with a strategy.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.970
Itachi…

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.430
Buy me some time, however little it may be.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.180
Despite what Lord Third said,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.130
he will move to protect the Leaf if push comes to shove.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.010
That's the kind of man he is.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.720
In which case even Hiruzen, as Hokage,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.760
will have no choice but to take decisive measures.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.300
Whether it results in war or not, the moment the coup d'etat happens,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.430
the Uchiha will lock themselves into a fate of annihilation.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.510
Including your innocent little brother.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.010
However, there is a way to spare just your little brother

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.470
prior to the coup d'etat.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.800
If things come to pass,

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.470
your brother will likely come to know the truth.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.220
And if he witnesses Leaf Shinobi slaughter his entire clan,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.880
it will give him a vengeful heart towards the Leaf.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.760
And then unfortunately, he will have to die as well.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.300
Is that a threat?

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.380
No, I just want you to make a choice.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.180
Either align with the Uchiha,

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.680
launch the coup d'etat, and die along with your clan…

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.090
Or side with the Leaf,

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.840
save your little brother before the coup d'etat

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.430
and then help us eliminate all other Uchiha.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.050
No matter what,

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.130
things must be quelled before any mayhem can arise

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.550
in order to protect the village.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.340
And the only shinobi who can be entrusted with this mission…

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.180
is you, a double agent for both the Uchiha and the Leaf.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.590
There is no one else…Itachi.

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:17.930
This will be the most painful mission for you.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.380
But on the other hand,

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.380
it will allow your little brother to be spared.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.510
I know you care about the village as much as I…

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.720
Will you accept this mission?

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.260
How do you know about me?

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.800
You slipped through extra tight Leaf Security

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.510
and went to examine Nakano Shrine's secret stone tablet.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.970
Only the Uchiha know its location.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.880
Since then, I've kept an eye on your movements,

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.470
and looked into what kind of character you are and what your ideology is.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.380
Well then, that saves me time.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.260
For you already know that I bear hatred

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.470
towards both the Leaf and my own clan…

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.510
I have terms.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.510
I will help you exact revenge upon the Uchiha Clan.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.510
But you are not to harm the village itself.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.760
Nor…Sasuke Uchiha.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.800
I regret now,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.970
not telling you everything before it had come to this.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.930
I see… So you've aligned with the other side?

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.050
Father, Mother…

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.720
I… I know, Itachi.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.130
Itachi, just promise me this.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.680
Take care of Sasuke.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.260
I will.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.760
Do not fear.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.300
This is the path you have chosen.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.300
Compared to you, our pain will be over in an instant.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.340
Even if our philosophies differ, I am proud of you.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.050
You are truly a kind child.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.340
There's nothing more to say.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:54.340
I have told you the whole truth. I won't have to ever again…

00:19:55.550 --> 00:20:00.300
I always lied to you and asked you to forgive me.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.550
Deliberately keeping you at a distance by my own hand.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.550
All because I didn't want you to get caught up in any of this.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.010
But now, I believe…

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.380
that perhaps you could have changed

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.550
Father, Mother, and the rest of the Uchiha.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.930
If I had been open with you from the start…

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.340
and looked you straight in the eyes and told you the truth,

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.630
then I wouldn't have had to stand before you,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.430
from above, as a failure, telling you all of this.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.470
So this time, I want to impart this truth to you…

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.340
You don't ever have to forgive me.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.760
And no matter what you do from here on out, know this…

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.380
I will love you always.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.090
Naruto, the Jinchuriki are gonna quit it!

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.760
Looks like Itachi did it!

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.380
Thanks, Itachi!

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.930
Then this means the other battles are…

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.880
Curse Kabuto, he's failed.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.930
Hey, what are you looking at? We're still fighting!

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.470
Looks like the Reanimation Jutsu has been released.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.340
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Reanimation Jutsu: Release!"

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.260
So what of it?

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.050
REANIMATION JUTSU: RELEASE!

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.510
Tune in again!
