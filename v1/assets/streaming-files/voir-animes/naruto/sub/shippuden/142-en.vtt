WEBVTT

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.500
How was the lower level?

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.530
Everyone was annihilated except for us.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.200
It seems like two of Sasuke's subordinates are still around here.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.870
Did you see them?

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.530
We haven't seen them.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.200
They probably died too.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.130
Everything is a mess down there.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.370
No. A Sensory-Type Ninja from the Hidden Cloud

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.430
confirmed that they survived.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.570
They asked us to capture them and then they left.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.000
Oh, is that so?

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.730
You two…

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.700
Remove your armor.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.070
Oh my, it seems we've been found out.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.730
Just as I thought, that wasn't a very good plan.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.530
Sakura, why did you do something like that?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.800
Sai! What are you doing here?

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.770
It's a clone.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm going to tell you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.070
what Sakura really wanted to say earlier, but couldn't.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.030
"Really wanted to say"?

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.530
What do you mean, Sai?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.730
Sakura didn't come to confess her love for you.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.400
The Hidden Leaf Ninja have come to a consensus

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.730
and I'm here to inform you.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.330
I thought it was strange.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.600
So she was hiding something after all.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.800
I've come to understand her feelings.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.800
Why Sakura couldn't bring herself to tell you.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.170
Tell me, Sai…

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.900
about the consensus.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.200
The Hidden Leaf will deal with Sasuke.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.070
Every one of your comrades is committed to that and will act accordingly.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.330
As One's Friend

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.330
The Hidden Leaf will deal with Sasuke.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.630
Every one of your comrades is committed to that and will act accordingly.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.000
Did Sakura… Did Sakura really agree to that?!

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.330
Sakura loves Sasuke so much!

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.430
And yet…

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.130
How could she?!

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.770
After Akatsuki's attack on our village,

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.030
the Hidden Leaf Ninja can no longer recognize Sasuke as one of their own,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.830
not after he supported the Akatsuki.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.930
Sakura is not a fool.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.030
She's not a child who wouldn't understand the difficulty of the situation.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.800
That's why we came here in person to try to explain it to you.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.870
Then why didn't she just come out and tell me the truth?

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.470
It wasn't that simple. You know that.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.930
She understood how hurt you would feel.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.130
But still…

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.800
By telling you she's given up on Sasuke

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.900
and declaring her love for you,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.370
she was freeing you from the burden of that promise you made.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.400
Naruto, this is a once in a lifetime request.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.000
Please…bring Sasuke back!

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.430
And still, you insisted on rescuing Sasuke.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.930
I believe that's why she couldn't tell you the truth.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.430
Because she was thinking about your feelings.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.570
In fact, she probably expected you to say that.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.430
To be honest, Sakura made us promise not to tell you the truth.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.930
She said she would tell you somehow.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.100
She said it was her duty to do so.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.230
But if she was expecting Naruto's reaction,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.730
she never intended to tell him the truth, right?

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.200
What is Sakura planning to do?

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.800
This is just an assumption on my part.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.430
But I believe Sakura…

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.330
She intends to kill Sasuke herself.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.630
Is that true, Sai?!

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.530
Probably.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.630
Please don't take it all on yourself.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.770
I feel the same way as you.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.430
So does everyone else.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.000
Oh…yeah.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.630
Thank you, Sai.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.470
I know.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.130
Sakura smiled and told everyone she would cooperate.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.000
But this time, I saw through her fake smile.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.930
No way. Sakura wouldn't do such a thing.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.600
She's crazy about Sasuke—

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.070
It's because she loves him so much

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.130
that she can't bear to watch Sasuke turn more and more evil.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.770
It's because she loves him so much

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.570
that she wants to save Sasuke from this path of evil.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.200
Even if that means killing the one she loves with her own hands.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.370
That is how committed she is to her love for Sasuke.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.070
And in doing so, Naruto…

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.370
She's prepared to accept your hatred.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:40.700
It's her way of atoning for the lifelong burden she placed on you.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.200
Until now, Sakura relied on you too much.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.100
This time, she intends to resolve everything alone.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.730
Sai… Why are you telling me all this?

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.930
Sasuke is the source of Naruto's agony.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.270
But aren't you a part of it too?

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.870
It wasn't my intention,

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.000
but I'm partly to blame for provoking Sakura.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.370
That's why I told you.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.770
I couldn't ignore what Sakura's doing.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.630
And besides, I belong to Team 7.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.230
I see.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.400
Having learned all this, Naruto must be in turmoil.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.800
Now then… What to do?

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.400
There is something you must hear immediately.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.130
We will tell you everything that happened at the Five Kage Summit.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.500
It's been a long time, Danzo.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.600
We haven't met since the Uchiha incident.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.630
Foo, Torune, assist me.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.000
I'm going to break the seal on my right arm.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.330
Keep him occupied.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.800
So you're going for it, Danzo?

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.970
Madara… His abilities are limitless.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.130
Be careful.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.170
– Yes, sir. – Yes, sir.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.870
Torune, we'll back each other up and attack.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.130
I know.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.830
Mind Transfer…

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.430
He disappeared into the pillar.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.370
It seems he can slip through objects after all.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.870
Well? Are you able to sense his chakra?

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.570
No. He has completely disappeared.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.830
A Sensory-Type with Mind Transfer skills.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.430
A member of the Yamanaka Clan, huh?

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.600
In order to protect himself,

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.570
he de-materializes his body at the moment of an attack

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.530
and passes right through it.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.170
But he solidifies his body to make physical contact when he attacks.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.000
We have to aim for the counterattack.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.070
That was a well thought out analysis.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.430
The counterattack must be timed perfectly.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.830
We'll attack one after the other and get him on the second stage.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.530
The first stage will be a diversion.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.600
I'll be the decoy.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.430
He's already seen through my Mind Transfer Jutsu.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.130
We'll go with your jutsu.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.500
Got it.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.630
That technique…

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.400
Torune… That jutsu…

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:12.570
Now!

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.670
This guy… He just pretended to attack.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.270
Damn it. We fell for it!

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.000
Hmm…

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.770
A jutsu to flush in chakra and destroy cells?

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.170
How troublesome.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.600
Forgive me, Foo.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.270
I'll extract them right away.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.770
This isn't chakra.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.870
These are nano-sized venom beetles.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.870
They are almost like bacteria.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.970
Insects that devour cells on contact.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.100
I've heard of them.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.930
You are a ninja from the Aburame Clan

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.470
who knows Hidden Ninjutsu.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.230
I see. You're the son of Shikuro Aburame,

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.330
the one with immunity to those insects.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.430
To think you were in the Foundation.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:27.500
Danzo!

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.700
You have yourself a good subordinate.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.330
Forgive me, Torune.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.400
Don't blame yourself, Foo.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.170
Use your sensors to locate him quickly.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.670
I'll get him the next time.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.500
Damn it!

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.600
He sucked in Torune!

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.030
My right arm has been injected with the venom beetles.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.970
You're next.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.370
I see.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.030
Who would have thought the meeting would become so intense.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.470
I guess with Danzo…

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.930
I'm not too eager about becoming the Hokage.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.670
And even if the situation requires me to accept…

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.330
I'll have to return to Hidden Leaf Village first

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.900
and hear what the others say.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.500
Madara has declared war on us!

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.130
There's no time to deliberate.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.530
I'm sure everyone will approve.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.070
We should have them proceed on the premise

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.070
that you are the Hokage, Kakashi.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.230
If our response is delayed

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.600
and the Akatsuki and Madara take the advantage,

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.770
that would be even worse.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.030
I guess you're right. Thanks.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.770
And Sasuke…

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.100
For him to attack the summit…

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.100
Naruto, this is a battle to protect the Eight-Tails and the Nine-Tails.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.270
Namely you.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.570
And it's also for the ninja world.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.300
As the Kazekage, I would give my life to protect you.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.400
If Sasuke Uchiha confronts

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.000
the Allied Shinobi Forces as a member of the Akatsuki,

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.870
I will show no mercy.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.100
Sasuke, you and I are alike.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.270
We've both walked through the darkness of this world.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.770
That's why you should be able to see even the faintest glimmer of light.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.970
In the past and even now.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.230
I closed my eyes long ago.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.070
My goals exist only in the darkness.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.400
Sasuke doesn't care about you.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.430
All he wants is darkness.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:51.470
Naruto, you told me, "I am going to be the Hokage."

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.100
I have become the Kazekage.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.330
If you are prepared to bear the burden of being a Kage,

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.800
then do what is right as Sasuke's friend.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.470
We've said everything we needed to say.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.470
Let's go, Gaara.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.870
We will return to our village.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.630
Kakashi Hatake…

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.100
With the understanding that you will be Hokage,

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.470
the Sand will take action.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.330
As allied nations,

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.700
I pray that there will be no conflicting intel between us.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.330
Understood.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.500
I consider you my friend.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.830
In the past, "friend" was merely a word to me.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.700
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.600
But after meeting you, you made me realize that…

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.800
the meaning of that word is what's important.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.700
What does it mean?

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:40.630
What can you do for Sasuke? Think hard about that.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:44.670
Let's go.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.630
Naruto…

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.000
Let him find the answer himself.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.580
Here I am, all alone with Sasuke in this dark place.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.280
Taking care of you while resisting every urge in my body.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.020
Hurry up and get well!

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.320
A-Are you all right, Sasuke?

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.780
Cold as ever. He'll never change.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.650
But…still…

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.050
Let me out of here.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.750
Don't be so hasty.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.120
I'll let you go.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.180
I have something for you outside.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.580
Sasuke Uchiha.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.980
You stay back.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.380
If you get involved, you'll die.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.320
Perfect.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.750
Sasuke… Madara…

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.350
I'll take both your Sharingan.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.280
Let me ask one thing.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.580
Is it true that Itachi Uchiha eliminated my clan by order of the Elders?

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.550
As I thought, you were special.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.680
Damn Itachi! I see he revealed everything to you before he died.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.720
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Danzo's Right Arm"

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.850
Don't say anymore about Itachi!

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:09.120
Tune in again!
