WEBVTT

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.000
Lost Bonds

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.400
Don't all those things we did together in Squad 7

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.930
mean anything to you?!

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.870
No… It wasn't meaningless.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.230
To me, you became…

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.370
my closest friend.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.500
I became your friend?

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.100
Then why?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.830
That's precisely why.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.970
That's precisely why…

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.470
you're worth killing.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.870
You're finally awake?

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.530
A dream?

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.270
Where am I?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.200
You lost consciousness.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.300
You really had us worried.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.770
Where are Kakashi Sensei and Sai?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.800
I see.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.400
Why?

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.670
Why did it turn out like this?

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.370
Naruto…

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.600
You should rest a bit longer.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.030
Come on.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.470
Sasuke…you're…

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.530
Did you hear? Everyone in the Uchiha Clan got killed.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.900
Yeah, I know. I heard my dad talking about it.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.470
He's the only one who survived.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.770
I was sorta glad back then.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.600
I wasn't the only one who was alone anymore.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.530
But Sasuke was good at everything he did.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.600
Good job, Sasuke!

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.300
Just what I'd expect from Sasuke!

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.130
He's so cool!

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.900
He's showing off! I can do that too!

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.400
He was so different from me.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.500
Go!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.030
That's why I picked him to be my rival,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.170
because I wanted to become like him.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.700
Even though we were both on Squad 7,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.470
Sasuke was always one step ahead of me.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.970
The reason why I trained so hard was because

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.530
I wanted to catch up to him, even just a little.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.000
"Am I strong?" All I want is the answer to that.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.100
I just wanted to fight the strong ones.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.230
And they are all right here.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.170
Naruto… I want to fight you too.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.970
I was really happy.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.900
It was the first time Sasuke acknowledged me as an equal.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.430
First off, let's have you guys introduce yourselves.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.530
But he…

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.170
My name's Sasuke Uchiha.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.470
I have lots of dislikes, but no likes in particular.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.000
And I don't feel like summing up my ambition as just a dream,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.370
but I do have an ambition.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.870
The ambition to restore my clan and

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.600
to kill a certain man without fail!

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.000
It's been a long time…Sasuke.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.030
Itachi Uchiha…

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.430
I will kill you!

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.900
This is the guy Sasuke talked about,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.530
the man he wants to kill?

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.630
It's just as you said…

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.370
I've hated you… and resented you.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.900
For the singular purpose of killing you, I…

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.330
I…

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.200
have lived my life!

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.530
You decided to live for revenge.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.470
My classified mission was indeed the assassination of Sasuke.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.870
But I've had enough of orders.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.570
I now want to act on my own beliefs.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.530
I think Naruto will get me to remember…

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.370
my past emotions.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.870
I don't know you very well.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.570
But there must be some kind of reason

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.930
Naruto and Sakura have pursued you so desperately.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.270
They don't want to sever their bonds with you.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.100
They're giving it their all to secure those bonds.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.130
I still don't understand it all that clearly.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.170
But Sasuke, you should understand.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.530
Yeah, I did understand.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.470
That's why I severed the bonds. I have a different bond.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.370
A bond of hatred with my older brother.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.600
What about the bond between Sasuke and me?

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.130
Hurry up!

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.700
Before that, put your headband on. I'll wait.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.030
I don't need that thing.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.700
Just do it!

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.370
You won't even be able to put a scratch on my forehead!

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.400
That's not it!

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.830
I'm saying this is a testament

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.230
to fighting on equal terms as Leaf Ninja.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.000
And I'm saying you're acting high and mighty!

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.870
Do you really think that we're equals?!

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.330
Yeah, I do!

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.370
I've never once thought that I was inferior to you!

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.830
You're an embarrassment!

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.270
That's because you're still weak, Little Sasuke!

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.170
Naruto!

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.570
Sasuke!

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.270
Stop it, both of you.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.100
Stop it!

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.400
Stop it, both of you!

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.300
Damn!

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.570
I can't stop completely!

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.330
Lord Orochimaru has already acquired the Immortality Jutsu.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.770
"Immortal" doesn't mean that his flesh can maintain itself forever.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.200
Before his body decays,

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.870
a strong, new body must be made into a vessel for his soul.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.400
That's…

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.900
Are you saying that's Sasuke?!

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.230
Yes… That's right.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.030
I won't let that happen!

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.070
When Sasuke abandoned the village,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.430
I really believed I could bring him back.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.030
But…

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.130
Have you snapped out of it yet?

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.770
You have no siblings or parents.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.330
How could you understand anything about me?!

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.730
You've been on your own since the beginning!

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.230
What makes you think you know anything about me?

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.030
Having that bond is what makes it painful!

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.530
And how could you know

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.030
what it feels like to lose that bond?!

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.870
In the end, I didn't understand Sasuke at all.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.700
I just thought I knew him.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.200
Why?

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.300
Why would you go so far for me?

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.930
Because this is the first bond that I've ever had!

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.570
That's why I'm gonna stop you.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.500
I admit it, you're strong.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.100
It's because you know the pain that solitude brings,

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.070
just as I do.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.770
And it's that pain that makes people stronger.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.970
And for that very reason, if I break that bond,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.530
I'll be able to achieve even greater strength.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.470
Did you know that this place is called the Final Valley?

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:21.230
Don't you think this is a perfect stage for us, Naruto?

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.600
You…

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.070
So let's bring this fight to a close soon!

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.130
How are you feeling?

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.270
I had them make some porridge.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.330
Eat it and restore your strength.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.670
I…was dreaming about Sasuke.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.870
You're going back to the village with me.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.700
They're Kakashi's orders.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.270
I'm sorry, but you just have to let Kakashi handle Sasuke.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.500
Got it?

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.570
Fine.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.530
Let me rest some more, then we can head back to the village.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.600
You should eat a little to restore your strength.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.370
I don't have an appetite.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.130
Sasuke said he was going to sever his bond with me

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:18.830
and become stronger.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.970
He said I could never understand his feelings.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.100
You were friends with Orochimaru long ago, right, Pervy Sage?

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.170
Why did Orochimaru desert the village

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.300
and decide to destroy the Hidden Leaf?

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.400
Orochimaru changed after his parents were killed.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.930
He became obsessed with Forbidden Jutsu.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.700
Maybe he longed to see his parents,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.930
or he sought revenge on the Leaf Village,

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.230
who he held responsible for their deaths.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.570
My parents weren't killed.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:03.830
So like you, I was accused of not being able to understand.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.300
Perhaps he was right,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.100
 I didn't understand a thing about him.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.030
However…

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:21.800
even I can see there's too much hate in our Ninja World.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.700
Hate?

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.830
And I've wanted to do something about this hatred,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.300
but I'm not sure what must be done.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.070
But I have faith that there will come a time

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.500
when people can truly understand one another.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:50.200
To me, Pervy Sage was irreplaceable. He was family.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.530
That's why…

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.000
Jiraiya-boy has died in battle.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.330
When I heard that Pervy Sage died,

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:14.730
I understood what Sasuke was talking about for the very first time.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.070
About the pain of losing a bond.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.900
Naruto, let's go soon. Are you still not ready?

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.230
I don't feel like going outside yet.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.730
Can you wait a bit longer?

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.000
All right. He still hasn't caught on that I'm a Shadow Clone.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.570
Have you come to understand a little of what pain is?

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.700
Unless you know the same pain, you cannot truly know another.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.070
And even if you get to know others, there can be no understanding.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.640
That is the truth.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.370
Just like how it's useless to chase after Sasuke.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.140
People change…

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.440
Sasuke isn't the old Sasuke anymore.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.170
Sasuke chose this himself.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.100
You must forget about Sasuke.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.270
If you are a ninja, become wiser.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.240
Fools cannot survive in our world. That is the reality.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.570
If being smart means what you say,

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.140
I'll remain a fool for the rest of my life.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.500
Pervy Sage, I'm a big fool after all.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.970
Kakashi Sensei's chakra…

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:16.740
This way!

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.500
Sakura, don't do anything reckless.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.900
This is just an assumption on my part.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.400
But I believe Sakura…

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.140
She intends to kill Sasuke herself.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.440
Sasuke has shouldered the entire burden of the Uchiha's hatred

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.570
and intends to strike the world with that curse.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.040
It is the most powerful weapon.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.840
It's his friend and source of power, this thing called hatred.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.970
And it is Sasuke's Ninja Way!

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.340
Did you know, Naruto?

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.170
When two shinobi are of a high enough level,

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.070
they are able to read each other's thoughts,

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.370
simply by an exchange of fists.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.340
Without ever uttering a single word.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.040
You're naïve, Naruto.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.900
Tell me, could you read…

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.940
my true feelings?

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.470
Sasuke… Right now…

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:35.740
I understand how you feel as someone who has lost a bond.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:44.840
You said earlier you consider Sasuke to be like a brother.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.770
What if Sasuke were to attack the Leaf Village?

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.400
What would you do then?

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.500
What? Why would Sasuke…?

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.270
There's no way he'd do something like that!

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.870
Sasuke is still naïve. He can easily be dyed any color.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.940
Would you be able to stop him?

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.470
Even if you had to kill Sasuke?

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.970
Could you weigh Sasuke against the Leaf Village

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.970
on a set of scales?

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.670
I would defend the Leaf Village!

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.040
But I would also stop Sasuke without killing him!

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.370
You're such a child.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.240
What you speak of are all fantasies.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.540
A ninja must sometimes make very harsh decisions.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.670
The Akatsuki will be branded as wanted fugitives.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.770
Then, not only I,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.070
but the whole world will hunt Sasuke down.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.040
Yet you bow your head for this criminal

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.870
and plead for mercy for your friend.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.040
In the ninja world, that is not friendship!

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.100
If you are prepared to bear the burden of being a Kage,

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.340
then do what is right as Sasuke's friend.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:05.240
I don't know what the right thing to do is.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.340
However…

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.370
Boy from the Hidden Leaf, think hard on what you must do!

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:15.300
The ninja world does not indulge fools!

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.470
I consider you my friend.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.900
In the past, "friend" was merely a word to me.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.170
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.200
But after meeting you, you made me realize

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.340
that the meaning of that word is what's important.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.740
What does it mean?

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:48.070
What can you do for Sasuke? Think hard about that.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.240
Sasuke…

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.670
If I see you…

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.300
If we meet, I think I'll know the answer.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.600
Sakura, you don't have to shoulder that burden yourself.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.100
It was my cowardice that split all of you up.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.770
I must have been trying to convince myself

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.370
that it could be like the old days again.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.900
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Burden"

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.340
I'm sorry I was such a careless teacher.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.740
Tune in again!
