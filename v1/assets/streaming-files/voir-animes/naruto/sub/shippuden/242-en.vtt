WEBVTT

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.150
Pursuing Hope

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.240
It's true that we've never gotten along in the past... Pursuing Hope

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.070
But we each did what we did to protect our brethren and clans.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.570
There perhaps were times we had no other choice.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.690
And now, today, even if our Five Nation Treaty comes to be...

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.490
I can't say how long it will last... or if we can even hold to it.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.240
But I have this dream, that sometime in the future...

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.860
there will come a day when shinobi will collaborate,

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.320
and help each other, with one heart, regardless of their affiliation.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.320
That is my... My dream of the future.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.030
Seems like our generation no longer needs to talk about that dream.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.110
Am I wrong?

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.860
Indeed.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.490
That goes without saying.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.280
But if we don't win here, it won't come to be!

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.940
Tsuchikage is right. Defeat is not an option.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.190
All right!

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.690
We'll spread out and take command...

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.400
and draw out the ultimate power from the Allied Forces!

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.070
That is our primary duty as the Five Kage!

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.070
– Scatter! – Scatter!

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.690
Sasuke!

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.900
I'll keep in sync with you!

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280
Incredible...

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.240
What just happened?

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.610
Naruto and Sasuke are attacking simultaneously.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.240
Did they succeed?

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.240
You better be prepared...

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.030
– I'll never let my comrades die! – I'll never let my comrades die!

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.740
This is...!

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.240
Naruto!

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.650
Even as he's fighting, he's helping his comrades recover...

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.240
Naruto! Just focus on what only you can do!

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.280
Leave the healing to me!

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.440
You don't understand, Sakura.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.070
Naruto is doing this unconsciously.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.030
Huh?

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.610
His chakra is acting on its own,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.110
from his deep desire to help Shikamaru.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.070
I can sense it clearly from my Mind Transmission Jutsu.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.240
Damn it, Naruto... You never change.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.530
You're always going overboard...

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.610
Sticking your neck out for us... How far will you go...?

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.610
All this time, you've never held back or compromised when it came to us.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.570
In front of you, I can't complain about what a drag things are...

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.280
Sorry, Dad...

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.190
Naruto doesn't want me... to join you just yet.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.440
Shikamaru, stop talking!

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.190
I‘m not letting you die!

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.110
Naruto...rather, everybody needs you!

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.650
Dad...

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.240
I only found out later that

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.990
Naruto had gone through a ton of painful, bitter things on his own.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.650
I don't ever want him to go through that again,

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.030
or at least that's how I feel... when I'm with him.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.070
I told you once, remember, Dad?

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.740
Someday, he's going to become a very important ninja to this village.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:07:01.360
When I'm with Naruto... he makes me want to follow him.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:12.780
Unlike Lord First, that dumb Naruto doesn't have an adept brother...

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.190
like Lord Second, to be his advisor.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.780
That's why... even more so...

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.780
I need to stick around so that when he becomes the Hokage,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.780
I can stand next to that idiot.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.320
So I'm sorry, Dad... I can't join you just yet.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.240
There's no one more qualified than me to be Naruto's advisor.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.280
Naruto, thank you...

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.360
Your chakra and the power of your heart saved him!

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.110
Yes! He's rallied!

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.110
Thank you, Sakura.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.360
Thank you, Naruto.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.780
Don't overdo it, Shikamaru.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.320
You just might become my advisor instead!

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.690
Don't worry, Akamaru.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.240
It's because a Kage can have up to three advisors.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.030
I want to stay by Naruto too.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.360
I'll have to work hard!

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.150
Shikamaru!

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.690
Lady Tsunade!

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.440
You did well!

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.860
Forgive me, Grandfather.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.490
Tsuna, don't apologize.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.360
I dragged this mess into my grandchildren's era.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.610
My cowardice is to blame...

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.610
But your heart and dreams have also been passed down

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.530
even beyond your grandchildren's era...

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.240
Yes, your... Will of Fire!

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.940
Hey!

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.490
Why you...!

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.610
All right!

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.990
Let's cut down this giant tree while he is distracted by his battle!

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.150
No matter how large it may be,

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.780
that tree is nothing compared to this very earth!

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.610
And the great earth, this land is on our side!

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.240
– Right! – Right!

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.900
I'm begging you!

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.280
I don't want us killing each other out of vengeance anymore!

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.530
A ninja does not bow his head so easily!

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.280
A ninja values action and strength!

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.860
It seems those who become Hokage like prostrating themselves, but...

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.400
As an act that relays one's heart,

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.280
perhaps it can lead to strength and be meritorious too.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.440
Let's go, everyone!

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.320
Okay! Double lariat time, bro! Yeah!

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.360
– Here we go! – Here we go!

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.530
As a woman, I mustn't get a late start on battle...

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.440
All right, everyone. Let's go!

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.190
– Right! – Right!

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.820
Damn it!

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.570
Naruto...

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.650
You have truly become a necessary existence to this world...

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.070
What the two of us had always wanted to be.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.240
And you will now save the entire world, Naruto!

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.240
– Everyone, follow me! – Everyone, follow me!

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.940
– Let's go! – Let's go!

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.320
All right, I think I should get going now.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.360
The springtime of my youth… hasn't ended yet!

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.780
Let's go, Lee! Tenten!

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.320
– Yes! – Right!

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.190
Your past is filtering into me through the others.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.440
Naruto Uzumaki, you are uniting everyone right now.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:50.610
Your tempestuous life made you into who you are.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.530
And your way of life has given everyone's hearts hope!

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.320
Let us pursue hope! Onward!

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.150
Let's do it!

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.280
Let's go!

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.320
Let's cut down that giant tree!

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.150
We samurai must not waver either!

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.990
Go forth!

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.360
Let's go too.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.440
Are you okay though, Shikamaru?

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.440
Yeah, I'm fully recovered.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.860
But what if that tree robs us of our chakra again...?

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.190
Now that we know, just have to be careful.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.240
Fourth, I'm going to use the link between your chakra and Naruto's.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.650
I can't move simultaneously like you,

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.820
but I'll still help protect them all with my Teleportation Jutsu.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.400
Orochimaru...

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.110
Are you just going to spectate?

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.570
I have no interest in this war.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:20.530
However, this dream of Obito's would lead to the elimination of this,

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.610
my precious laboratory...

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.690
So I suppose I cannot support it.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.030
Then lend me a hand.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.190
Fine then.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.030
I'll partake in a bit of nostalgia...

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.900
and participate in some student and teacher teamwork!

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.990
I'll shift to a more offensive form!

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.860
What is it?!

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.860
Do not panic!
It's coming!

00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.900
Huh?!

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.150
What?

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.030
I'll use my Teleportation Jutsu to whisk anyone in danger away.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.320
So go forth without fear!

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.190
It's the voice of Lord Second!

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.820
We can give it our all. It's because...

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.110
Still, don't get careless!

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.400
With two 100 Healings adepts, we can likely summon

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.440
one-tenth of Katsuyu's actual body here from Shikkotsu Woods!

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.530
We'll mold Katsuyu into the Allied Force's entire footing,

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.570
into a Healing Area where one can be restored just by standing on her.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.400
Ready, Sakura?

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.490
Yes!

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.900
– Summoning Jutsu! – Summoning Jutsu!

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.280
Ino! Have you relayed that to everyone?

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.190
Yes!

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.190
Huh? What's that going to do?

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.110
Is this it?!

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.320
This way, we can fight without our chakra being stolen!

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.320
Oh, this is great!

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.320
So this is the Healing Area?!

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.940
If you understand, quit playing around and get going!

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:06.940
Where's Naruto?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:15.990
Damn it!

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.360
He really is fast...!

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.320
But...

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.360
I'm starting to sense him better and better!

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.110
– Right there! – Right there!

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.490
It's about time that you go to sleep.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.360
I'll guide you into the dream.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.030
There's no time left!

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.400
Obito...

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:12.780
I bet you really did want to confirm...

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.280
whether a heart that never bends and a Will of Fire that does not waver...

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.190
are truly possible.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.320
You gave up on them once.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:45.150
But after fighting Naruto and hearing his words...

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.110
deep down, you're not able to deny that they might really exist.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.240
Isn't that right, Obito?

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.940
And yet, you still search

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.820
and test everyone and everything to prove yourself wrong.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.070
Which is why even now, as you stand at the precipice...

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:25.940
Huh?!

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.940
What?!

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.530
What is that?!

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.940
What was that just now?!

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.240
Naruto and Sasuke are...

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.320
But wait...!

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:18.320
You seek the answer...in Naruto.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.440
Why do you get up?!

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.400
And what are you fighting for?

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.280
Is it for your comrades? Or is it for this world?

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.030
Listen, friends will eventually betray you.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.820
And this world transforms love into hatred.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.440
You should know!

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.490
In the past, the people of the village and Sasuke betrayed you.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:06.150
And your love for Jiraiya made you hate.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.150
You and I are the same.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.740
The cumulative weight of all your suffering will change you in time.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.440
And now, even more pain shall assault you.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.990
And you still insist that you will not change?!

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.280
You don't know when your friends will betray you again...

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:38.110
Or if the Allied Forces might go back to fighting each other.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.320
And you don't even know if you can defeat me!

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.240
There is no reason to keep on fighting for a world like this.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.690
In a few minutes, this world will be gone anyway.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.570
Why do you still fight?

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.900
Because it's my Ninja Way.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.900
I never go back on my word.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.320
That's my Ninja Way.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.490
I thought I told you to go to sleep!

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.690
Let's settle this with our next move, Naruto!

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.110
Right!

00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.110
We'll sleep tomorrow, dreaming our own dreams!

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.260
Obito...when people see someone trying twice as hard as others,

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.680
they instinctively start wanting to lend a hand.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.680
That's because people eventually learn that

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.680
they only have each other to fill the holes in their hearts.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.190
And he who possesses a heart filled with comrades...

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.980
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "A Heart Filled with Comrades"

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.270
...is truly powerful!

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.610
A HEART FILLED WITH COMRADES Tune in again!
