WEBVTT

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.210
I see…

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.500
Sasuke and Naruto are in an alternate Time-Space

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.000
as well as Sakura and Kakashi.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.380
Naruto and Sasuke are the core participants in the battle.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.880
I wish we could have gotten your advice and aid a bit earlier.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.290
This lower body is a part of Madara after he became the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.210
In short, it contains Ten Tails, Madara and Hashirama…

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.880
No, rather Nine Tails, Madara and Hashirama.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.130
No, rather Nine Tails, Indra and Ashura.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.630
I'm only able to emerge like this now because their chakra is finally one.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.380
Going back to the jutsu you mentioned earlier,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.420
just what exactly are you doing to do?

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.210
I will weave the signs for the jutsu.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.960
But this jutsu requires a vast amount of chakra…

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.420
which I don't have right now since I've given it away.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.460
There's very little time. I ask you to just do as I say.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.700
THE TWO OF THEM…ALWAYS

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.950
This man lent me his power. That's how we were able to get here.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.030
He did?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.240
Oh no…

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.780
Damn it… I can't… Not until I can bring them back…

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.830
Hang on!

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.870
Will I…

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.080
break my promise again?

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.370
Rin?

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.080
You know, Rin, you saving me,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.530
is really the same as you saving the world.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.660
Hmm?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.700
I mean…

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.580
It's because I'm gonna become the Hokage and end this war!

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.830
For me to do that I have to stay strong and healthy in this world.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.160
So…how do I put it?

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.780
If you don't stay close and keep an eye on me…

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.830
I mean…

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.530
Well…

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.740
Y-You got so close all of a sudden!

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.120
Don't scare me like that!

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.080
You just said to stay close and keep an eye on you?

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.740
Yeah, I did.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.160
So watch over me.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.620
I'm going to wear the Uchiha crest…

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.740
and definitely become the Hokage!

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.160
Okay!

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.280
Oh man, oh man, oh man! This is the one day I can't be late!

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.830
NINJA ACADEMY ENTRANCE CEREMONY

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.330
- Where do you wanna go? - I don't know, where should we go?

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.740
It's the entrance ceremony and you're already late.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.870
Someone like you has no business being in the Academy.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.240
You'll never make it.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.740
It's okay.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.120
I got this just for you.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.990
For me?

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.160
Yes! Just submit this and you'll be able to enroll.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.660
Thank you! You're a lifesaver!

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.780
Keep pampering him and he'll never be cured of his tardiness.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.700
Shut up! Do you wanna fight?

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.200
Begin!

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.450
Stop right there!

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.620
That's amazing!

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.910
What's with that headband?

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.490
You passed!

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.740
Congratulations!

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.080
Thanks.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.330
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.830
As if! I'll catch up to you in no time!

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.410
Just you wait!

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.830
Obito…

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.910
Class is starting. Let's go.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.490
Rin…

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.410
Keep…

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.490
Keep watching over me, okay?

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.450
Huh?

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.910
I…

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.660
I'll catch up to him!

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.740
Then I'll surpass him and

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.620
I'll become the Hokage, no matter what!

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.700
Don't worry, I'll always be watching.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.280
I found you, Obito!

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.700
Huh? Rin!

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.830
Are you all right?!

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.700
I just slipped. I'm okay. I'm okay.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.740
Here is the graduation certificate for Obito Uchiha!

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.910
This certifies that you have graduated from the Hidden Leaf Ninja Academy.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.120
You are commended for persevering through the rain and wind

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.120
to reach this milestone!

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.700
Here! Congratulations on graduating.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.660
Rin!

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:08.830
Thank you, Rin.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.700
No one's here to watch.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.990
But this makes me happier than receiving it from Grandpa Hokage!

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.660
We've been assigned to a team and now…

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.870
this is our first step as shinobi!

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.490
I still have a long ways to go,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.490
but I'm a little bit closer to becoming the Hokage…right?

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.280
CHUNIN EXAMS FIRST STAGE TEST

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.910
I'M ALWAYS WATCHING YOU. -RIN

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.080
CHUNIN EXAMS THIRD STAGE ONE-ON-ONE BATTLES

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.490
I'm going to have you pay me back in full for the last time.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.700
The "last time"?

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.580
Do your best, Obito!

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.240
All right… Just watch me!

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.580
Begin!

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.870
Wha—?!

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.870
The winner is Might Guy!

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.620
What is he doing?

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.740
So this is where you are.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.530
O-Oh, it's you, Rin.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.490
It's only natural that Kakashi passed.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.280
But we can do it too. I know we can!

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.780
Let's practice hard for next year!

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.240
But it's hard to get pumped up after watching Kakashi…

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.780
What are you saying?!

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.330
You're going to be the Hokage, aren't you?

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.780
I'm always watching you!

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.740
Okay!

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.660
NINJA ACADEMY

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.780
Obito…

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.910
I did it!

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.700
I'm a Chunin now!

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.280
You're late again!

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.910
A lot happened on my way here and I got lost…

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.410
How come every path you take is a roundabout route?

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.870
Just walk a straight line!

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.870
They're not falling into line at all, are they?

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.700
That's for sure. But you know, Sensei…

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.030
Let me handle this.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.870
I'll watch over the two of them…always!

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.950
Let's go…

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.120
…you guys!

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.700
I was stubborn and never at ease.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.030
But you never failed to come to my rescue.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.280
Since it's a dream, everything is how you want it!

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.080
Even the dead can be alive again!

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.530
A world of only victors…

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.780
A world of only peace…

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.700
A world of only love…

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.700
I will create such a world.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.120
Rin… again…

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.740
I'll create a world where we can be together again.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.330
Thank goodness!

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.830
You came back!

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.280
There's still something I must do.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.330
We're going back, you two.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.370
Hang on to me.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.620
All right!

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.870
There's no mistake.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.910
Those things…

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.830
They cut down the Shadow Clones earlier.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.660
The Clones are desperately protecting that one.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.530
There's no mistake, Mother.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.740
The one with the Truthseeker Orbs behind him is the real one!

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.910
There's no end to them!

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:19.030
Am I powerless to do anything but watch?

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.700
Right now, even Sakura and Obito are desperately…

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.120
I…

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.370
I really couldn't do much for you as your teacher.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.030
Nor you, Obito and Rin…

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.240
as your friend.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.410
I just put on airs because I was an elite,

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.160
and kept making mistakes.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.620
It's not over yet!

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.870
There's no way I'm gonna lose!

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.830
What am I doing wallowing, when Naruto's fighting so hard?

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.620
That's why I'm never any good.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.780
There should be something I can still do!

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.830
Obito!

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.240
Impossible! It's Sasuke!

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.910
He's here!

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.580
Now, there's nothing to worry about.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.740
No way!

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:49.910
Naruto!

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.740
Why you!

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.280
He passed the Truthseeker Orbs to a clone?

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.910
We fell for something so simple!

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.330
Thank you, Sakura and Obito!

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.740
What? You're okay?

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.490
You scared us there!

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.700
Sasuke!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.910
Did you thank Sakura and Obito properly?

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.490
Focus on the enemy!

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.370
Well, Naruto was always unexpectedly cunning.

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:26.780
Mother…

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.200
Since they've reunited, we have no other choice.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.700
We can't afford to be stingy with our chakra.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.580
I know that.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.240
My body feels so heavy.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.830
This terrain… is digging into my body!

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.620
I can't levitate!

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.700
A heavy gravity plane this time!

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:13.870
Except…

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.870
She's affected too.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:32.910
Oh no!

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.330
Damn it! The Visual Prowess in my left eye hasn't…

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.490
Dodge it, Sasuke!

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.660
Is the heavy gravity distorting your aim?

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.870
I've now adjusted for it. I won't miss with the next one.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.830
I won't let you!

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.660
There's something that I can still do.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.410
I can at least be a shield for them!

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.030
– Let me make it in time! – Let me make it in time!

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:53.700
– Rin! – Rin!

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.870
Again, you…

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.330
Thank you, Rin.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.740
Obito and I will be joining you soon.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.660
We can catch up then… together, the three of us.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.830
Rin…

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.490
This time, when I get there…

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.870
Let's spend some alone time together, just you and me.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.870
Kakashi would just be in the way.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.580
I'm gonna leave him here.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.160
This is…Kamui!

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.280
Obito! You!

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.740
Kakashi… You stay here a little while longer.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.410
Don't you rush to follow us!

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:51.030
After fighting you, I feel like I've woken up.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.700
When I was a kid, I'd imagine myself as the Hokage so often.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.780
I think it's because you brought back…

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:05.830
that indescribable feeling of exhilaration and uncertainty.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.240
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "You Better…"

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.700
Don't laugh at Obito!

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.370
YOU BETTER…

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:35.530
Tune in again!
