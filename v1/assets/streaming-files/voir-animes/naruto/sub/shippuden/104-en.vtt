WEBVTT

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.430
Let's go, Akamaru!

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.000
- Yamato! - Yes sir!

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.030
Fang Over Fang!

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.730
Rasengan!

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.200
What?!

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.130
You're mine!

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.400
Huh?! Whoa! What?!

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.770
I-I can't breathe...

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.370
I'm keeping you restrained like that!

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.000
Impossible!

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.270
I'm really flexible, you see?

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.130
Now to fight back!

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.270
Hidden Jutsu!

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.800
Retreat! Naruto! Kiba!

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.270
Frill-Necked Lizard!

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.570
That's all there is to this jutsu.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.300
He's toying with us...

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.770
This formation didn't work either.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.600
He skillfully dodged all of our attacks.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.270
Kakashi Sensei... Yeah...I know.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.270
Naruto... Our formation attack was timed dead on, right?

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.430
Yeah...

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.270
He should have taken a direct hit! So how was he able to evade it?!

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.130
We probably did hit him.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.930
Huh?

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.870
It was the same when I first attacked him with my Rasengan.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.370
I was sure I hit him...

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.300
In other words, he made it look like he evaded it, when in actuality;

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.700
he allowed you and your jutsu to slip right through his body.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.270
Is that what you're saying, Naruto?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.400
Huh? Umm...

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.200
Cripes, Shino! It's hard to grasp what you're trying to say!

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.030
Maybe it's a clone...

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.400
or some sort of genjutsu that makes you see illusions or visions?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.030
I-I thought so too, so I used my Byakugan

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.600
to increase my field of vision and checked the chakra.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.800
The only chakra I detected is the one where he is.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.530
There we go!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.300
Slipped through... No wonder...

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.470
Kakashi Senpai... What do you think?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.970
No doubt about it.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.900
That's some unique jutsu only he possesses.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.270
Which makes it a real bother, but...

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.800
Shino... I know.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.830
The Mystery of Tobi

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.600
For this type of situation,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.600
someone like Shino who uses Hidden Jutsu is useful.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.730
Whoa! You're one of the Aburame clan!

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.070
Man, all wiggly and gross!

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.630
Heh! Shino! You look eager for a change!

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.970
Of course.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.470
That's because I was left out of that last Sasuke rescue mission.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.830
Go!

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.530
Gross, I tell ya!

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.430
Hey Shino! He's dodging them so easily!

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.070
Rather than a concentrated pin-point attack,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.470
the Aburame clan specializes

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.330
in making use of space to conduct a wide-range attack.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.700
Naruto, you haven't teamed up too often with Shino on missions.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.400
So let Shino handle this and watch him.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.430
You'll get in the way of his insects.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.070
What do you mean I'll get in the way?!

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.300
Disperse!

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.830
Now, he won't be able to get away.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.800
There's no way he can evade all the insects.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.000
Oh!

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.500
Is he dodging or just slipping through?

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.900
I'll figure out his jutsu!

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.070
Do it! Hidden Jutsu: Beetle Sphere!

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.600
Wait a sec!

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.070
All right! Way to go, Shino!

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.770
I will settle this.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.900
Because now that I'm part of this mission,

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.570
I must make myself useful this time!

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.730
Cripes... You're still bearing that grudge, aren't you?!

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.900
The insects are closing in...

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.070
It's impressive how he can manipulate so many insects so easily.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.570
Well, Hinata?

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.730
Y-Yes! I'm able to detect the target's chakra.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.600
He is definitely inside the swarm of Shino's insects.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.400
- Yamato! - Right!

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.570
We're ready to attack anytime.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.370
How is it, Shino?

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.170
I feel him resisting.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.500
That's because the Parasitic Insects are frantically sucking up his chakra.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.570
All right! Just let 'em suck him dry then!

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.400
What's going on?

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.630
My insects, which were reacting to his chakra,

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.230
have suddenly lost him.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:48.770
This is impossible...

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.600
Teleportation Jutsu?

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.200
No, it wasn't teleportation.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.170
Because if it was teleportation,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.070
my insects would respond and follow in his direction.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.200
They wouldn't let him escape.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.300
Then he used a Transportation Technique?

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.270
No...that's impossible.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.930
But he...suddenly...just vanished.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.330
He traveled through space

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.600
without weaving signs, summoning, or using marks?

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.530
That's a Transportation Technique that far surpasses the Fourth Hokage!

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.570
He erased his whole body. He can erase his entire presence?

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.800
No way...

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.930
But if we accept the fact that he can erase his existence at will,

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.530
then it follows that he can also erase just a part of his body as well.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.170
Which explains why a part of his body,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.130
which should have been hit by an external attack, disappeared.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.400
And to us, it would look like the attack went right through him.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.430
So he didn't evade the attacks,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.930
they really were slipping right through him.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.330
I found him!

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.300
Over there!

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.130
Oh! Hello, hello.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.600
Don't think you can escape my nose!

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.200
Tunneling Fang!

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.030
Hey, Kiba! Don't be reckless!

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.270
Did he slip away again? Damn!

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.300
Kiba... I think this time, he simply dodged.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:39.930
How did it go?

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.400
It's over.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.230
What...is that?

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.000
He was on the Akatsuki roster Kabuto left us with.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.530
We keep getting interference!

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.470
Sasuke has won. Itachi Uchiha is dead.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.830
Sasuke has won. Itachi Uchiha is dead.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.530
What?! I don't believe it!

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.030
Just kidding... It's as I expected.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.370
S-Sasuke...killed...Itachi?

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.730
Sasuke's down too, but... I wonder how he is?

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.930
He's in pretty bad shape.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.370
Hey! You there, spiky aloe guy!

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.230
Where's Sasuke now?!

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.100
Aloe?!

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.500
Don't bother with him.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.400
I'll take you on another time.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.530
That's...a Sharingan?!

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.130
Who...in the world is he?!

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.770
Later.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.830
We must find Sasuke before they do!

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.900
Hinata! Check in the direction of four o'clock.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.470
Y-Yes, sir!

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.500
Byakugan!

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.100
I can see strong chakra over a wide scope

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.000
about ten kilometers ahead.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.970
Also...for some reason... the forest is burning...

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.900
from black flames.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.630
Amaterasu?!

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.500
That's it! Everyone, follow me!

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.870
This time for sure!

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.370
Full speed ahead!

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.600
You're late.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.830
I'm not you, so I can't move as fast.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.730
If you were watching, you better have recorded all of it.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.970
Relax. Everything is recorded.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.030
I'll take a good look later.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.930
We're taking Itachi's corpse too. We should go now.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.900
I detected their scents.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.870
They've already reached where Sasuke is.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.230
Damn them!

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.230
So this is Amaterasu... I've never seen it before!

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.970
What is that?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.100
That is Itachi's jutsu!

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.970
Be careful!

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.330
That fire will not go out until it completely incinerates anything it ignites.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.670
Yamato!
Yes, Senpai!

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.200
Earth Style! Planet Splitter!

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.670
Please proceed!

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.430
Right! Everyone, except Yamato, follow me!

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.130
Quit wasting time.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.670
You're...

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.500
Zetsu.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.470
Tsk. We're not wasting time.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.500
So it's over?

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.470
Yeah, it's settled.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.830
What about Sasuke?

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.230
He's okay. Sasuke won.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.370
And...where's Sasuke?

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.400
He's already been evacuated to a safe place.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.000
Safe place?

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.570
Akatsuki's hideout in the east. You should head there too.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.900
The Hidden Leaf will come here very shortly.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.530
Let's go...to where Sasuke is!

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.000
What will you do, Kisame?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:40.370
If Itachi passed away, I think I'll spread my wings for a while.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.670
I see... Do as you please.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.370
What happened here anyway?

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.170
What kind of battle would cause this?

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.130
Two Sharingan users...

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.070
Is the battle between the Uchiha Clan... this intense?

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.000
Where's Sasuke?

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.470
I don't detect any other chakra besides ours in this area.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.570
There's still a faint smell left, but...

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.100
We were too late...

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.800
Naruto...

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.570
Why?

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:48.030
Why is it that I can never reach Sasuke?

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.430
I treated your wounds.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.870
You won.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.870
But you've sustained quite a bit of damage as well.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.430
Try not to force yourself up.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.200
We've met once before.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.500
That appearance... You're...

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.100
The last time, it was as enemies.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.670
Don't worry about Deidara's death...

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:19.100
I am not your enemy.

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:26.730
I brought you here in order to tell you something.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.300
You're not interested at all, I see...

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.030
Maybe if I put it another way, you'll want to listen?

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.300
It is about Itachi Uchiha.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.700
Yes... You think you know about your brother,

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.170
but you know nothing.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.830
Oh, all right... Let's start with introductions.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.200
Like you, I am a survivor of the Uchiha Clan...

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.070
And the one who knows the truth about Itachi Uchiha.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.330
It can't be!

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.370
What was that just now?

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.300
The Amaterasu, which Itachi implanted inside you.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:39.300
How like Itachi. He surprises you even after he's dead.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.670
To think he planned things this far...

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.000
What are you talking about?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.770
In order to kill me, he placed a jutsu into you...

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:54.500
Or rather should I say; in order to keep me away from you...

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.100
He probably set his Amaterasu to self-activate

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.130
when you look into my Sharingan.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.670
Even Itachi didn't know everything about me...

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.230
Otherwise I would be dead right now.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.200
So this was his fail-safe plan...

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.530
Although it didn't work on me.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.900
So...what's this all about?

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.130
Before he died, Itachi must've done something to you.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.130
At the end...for your sake,

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.670
he transferred his own ocular powers to you.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:47.230
What are you saying? Just...what are you trying to say?

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.670
Why would Itachi do something like that?!

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.730
Don't you get it?

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.500
In order to...protect you.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.630
To protect me?!

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.500
Are you kidding me?

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.530
You think you know about your brother, but you know nothing.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:49.100
If you continue speaking such nonsense, I'll kill you!

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.470
What I'm saying is the truth.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.770
Itachi did mention it, did he not?

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.430
About his accomplice that night?

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.330
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Fate"

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.870
I am Madara Uchiha.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:09.230
Tune in again!
