WEBVTT

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
When's the light gonna fade?!

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.990
Just calm down, loser.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.280
How can I?!

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.160
We don't know what's happening to everyone outside!

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.160
All we can do right now is wait.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.660
Until the Infinite Tsukuyomi subsides, we can't go outside.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.910
Itachi's Story – Light and Darkness: Moonlit Night

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.990
That's my boy!

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.240
You've become a member of the ANBU and I'm very proud.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.950
However, keep this close to your heart.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.080
Though you're an ANBU,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.790
you are first and foremost Itachi of the Uchiha Clan.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.160
Yes.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.200
You're the only one I can count on, my best friend.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.290
Protect the Village, and the Uchiha name.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.790
If I die, many things will change…

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.950
I've left a note.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.950
Shisui?!

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.540
Don't stop me, Itachi…

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.790
If you're truly my friend.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.490
Shisui!

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.990
Shisui Uchiha, who threw himself into the Nakano River

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.740
and killed himself last night…

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.200
I'M TIRED OF MISSIONS. IF THINGS CONTINUE, THERE'S NO FUTURE LEFT FOR THE UCHIHA...AND FOR ME. I CAN NO LONGER GO AGAINST THIS PATH. Why don't you come out and say it?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.990
Why don't you come out and say it?

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.370
You suspect me, don't you?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.290
Yeah, we do, you punk.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.740
Listen, Itachi.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.080
Just try and betray the clan.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.830
And you'll pay big time.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.580
The clan, the clan...

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.950
You overestimate your own abilities,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.950
and have no idea about the depth of my own.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.990
That's why you're groveling there now.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.080
Stop, Itachi!

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.120
What is going on?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.870
Just wha—

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.870
There's no hope left…

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.040
for this pathetic clan.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.240
Brother!

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.990
Please stop!

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.040
Observe carefully with those eyes... Sasuke.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.790
Observe how shallow this clan is.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.080
From today, you are now an ANBU squad leader.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.950
It's not the Foundation,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.740
but mission orders will come from me…

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.290
There is no need to report this to Hiruzen and his staff.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.370
Yes.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.490
Without further pause, I have a mission for you.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.290
It's a simple assassination.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.990
The two behind you will assist you.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.450
We are your subordinates from today.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.540
We're honored to be of service.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.540
Good work…

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.330
By the way...

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:03.990
While you were away,

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.040
the surveillance team that is covering the Uchiha reported that

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.160
the Leaf Police is strengthening their armaments.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.240
What does this signify?

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.120
Resentment towards the Village has been increasing among the Uchiha.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.160
So we can't ignore it?

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:24.160
No.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.040
FIRE LEAF EXAM ATTEMPTS: 1 SPECIALIZED SKILLS: TAIJUTSU
NOTES: EXCEPTIONAL IMPROVEMENT IN TAIJUTSU SKILLS OVER THE PAST YEAR.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.080
CLASSIFIED

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.620
Welcome home, Big Brother!

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.790
I'm going to go train.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.040
Come with me.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.620
I'm exhausted from my mission.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.580
You never get tired, Big Brother.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.990
Ouch!

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.950
Forgive me, Sasuke. Maybe some other time.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.160
Man!

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.410
You know about the clan meeting in three days, right?

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.240
No.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.870
Come alone to the Nakano Shrine after the meeting.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.950
Without your ANBU subordinates.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.700
I'll be leaving tomorrow on a mission away from the Village.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.490
Don't run away.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.740
"Run away"?

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.490
From what?

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.990
From your Uchiha destiny…

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.120
Do you understand? I'll be waiting.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.990
You two standby here.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.990
But, Captain!

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.370
Just report that to Lord Danzo.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.540
Within the clan, only those who possess the Sharingan

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.040
can read the stone tablet…

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.200
And even then, they can read only part of it.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.120
But with your Mangekyo Sharingan, you should be able to read further.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.990
So you want me to tell you what it says?

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.490
That's not necessary.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.660
Mangekyo?!

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.870
You have them too, Father?

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.490
It was during the Third Great Ninja War…

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.120
My friend gave his life to save me.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.080
Along with his tears of blood, the Mangekyo was born.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.080
The Uchiha's way to salvation is carved into this stone.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.790
But even with the Mangekyo Sharingan,

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.990
the end cannot be deciphered.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.160
It seems we still have a way to go.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.120
However, even if it's part way,

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.950
once you read it, you will understand, Itachi.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.040
The current situation forced upon the Uchiha Clan right is wrong.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.540
Even so, to use force to overcome it is…

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.910
The higher-ups of the Village fear us.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.240
That is why they persecute us...

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.580
out of fear towards our Sharingan.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.790
You're right.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.830
They fear we will control the Nine Tails

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.990
with the power of the Sharingan.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.080
That's just… …the legend of Madara Uchiha.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.540
Since then, no one has done something like that.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.620
We don't even know if anyone can.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.990
But the higher-ups cling to the ghosts of the past,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.120
and keep us at a distance out of fear.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.910
If they fear us…

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.790
there is nothing else left to do, but for us to control them.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.660
Will you use force to become the Hokage?

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.790
It's because the clan wishes it.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.330
I can't stop them.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.490
But I want to avoid the use of brute force.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.950
That is why I kept my Mangekyo Sharingan a secret.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:10.950
Why?

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.370
I can control the Nine Tails with Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.950
If the clan learns of this, they would desire even more.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:20.990
Watch!

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.740
We've brought the Jinchuriki!

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.790
Let's do it!

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:28.950
The captain can do it!

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.990
- Captain! - Please!

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.370
Use the power of the Uchiha!

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.740
That's!

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.990
Many in the clan resent the Village.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.490
When you're pushed into a corner, you'll resort to things like this.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.120
There will be much bloodshed on both sides.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.990
But Itachi... if you are with me…

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.950
We can take them by surprise and restrain the higher-ups.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.620
Some fighting will ensue,

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.160
but with your help as a member of ANBU,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.830
a bloodless revolution can happen!

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.910
"A bloodless revolution"?!

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.490
Itachi, you're my son. Please!

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.660
Save our clan!

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.080
Captain?

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.120
Your orders.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.870
FIRE

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.120
The Uchiha Clan…

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.040
is intent on revolting against the Hidden Leaf.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.260
There's no time to waste.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.550
We must strike preemptively before them.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.260
The Uchiha were our comrades in arms in past wars…

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.340
I would like to use words before violence.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.840
I will come up with a way.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.510
Despite what Lord Third said… when push comes to shove…

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.590
He will do what whatever it takes to protect the Hidden Leaf.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.090
I want you to choose.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.010
Align with the Uchiha and launch the coup d'état,

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.140
and be slaughtered along with your family…

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.140
Or side with the Leaf,

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.300
and before they attempt a coup d'état,

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.090
eliminate every Uchiha except your younger brother?

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.050
Eliminate the Uchiha… In order to protect the Leaf,

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.140
every possible step must be taken to avoid mayhem.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.970
The only one that can handle this mission is you,

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.140
a double agent for both the Uchiha and the Leaf.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.590
There is no one else, Itachi.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.510
Will you accept this mission?

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.720
The Village…the clan…shinobi…

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.430
Is fighting…inevitable?

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.220
The Village or the clan…

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.930
What should I do?

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.840
I wasn't serious just now.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.890
Yes , you were, loser.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.010
If I were serious, I would have beaten you!

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.090
This time, I challenge you to the high jump!

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.010
You're no match for me.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.550
What did you say?!

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.550
Hey…

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.140
There's something I would like you to help me with.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.890
LEAF POLICE FORCE

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.550
Who are you?!

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:49.930
Itachi...

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.970
What lies beyond this slaughter?

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.760
Are you going to show me...

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.550
a different future from the one I showed you?

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.430
This.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.890
LEAF POLICE FORCE

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.680
Oh... Such fine eyes.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.390
No way!

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.890
Help…Itachi.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.720
Help me!

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:39.010
This is what I see for the future of the village…and for the clan.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.930
I see…

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.760
Sasuke, eh?

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.260
A shadow Clone!

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.300
Father is the worst possible enemy for me.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.140
This is going to be a battle of Mangekyo Sharingan…

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.010
Over here…

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.720
There are no traps. Come inside.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:23.760
Father!

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.890
I don't want to participate in a death match…with my son.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:31.800
I see…

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.050
You've aligned with the other side.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.340
Father, Mother…

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:38.760
I…

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.010
We already know, Itachi…

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.430
Itachi, promise me this.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.090
Take care of Sasuke.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.430
I will.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.890
Do not fear it.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.430
This is the path you've chosen.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.590
Compared to yours, our pain will end in an instant.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.090
Our philosophies may differ, but I'm proud of you.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.590
You truly are a kind child.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.090
It's over.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.090
You're…

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.800
Never mind. Shall we go?

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.050
Go on ahead.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.140
I'm going to confirm things… with the Leaf higher-ups.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.220
First, you have my thanks.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.220
Civil war has been averted in the Hidden Leaf.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.090
We have maintained peace.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:10.890
Yes.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:16.720
However, I regret that there was no other way to achieve this.

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.550
I apologize.

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:21.050
I'm the one who must apologize.

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.970
You will now be branded a Rogue Ninja

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.930
who massacred his entire clan,

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:30.260
and be listed in the Bingo Book as a fugitive, wanted dead or alive.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.510
That goes without saying.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.140
What will you do from now?

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.140
I've found aid from a group called the "Akatsuki."

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.930
I intend to stay close to them

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.010
in order to make sure a promise is not broken.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.840
What do you want now?

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.180
You're a Rogue Ninja listed in the Bingo Book, Captain.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.800
An S-class, no less.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.010
As Foundation members, we want to make it appear like we pursued you.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.140
- Please go easy on us. - Please go easy on us.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.090
Your swordsmanship hints at more than just maintaining "appearances."

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.550
The Sharingan won't work.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.050
We won't look into your eyes.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.180
A genjutsu?!

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:25.840
How?!

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.760
When you first came to me as my subordinates…

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.180
We are your subordinates from today.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.470
I imbedded a suggestion in case you turned your sword on me.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:43.050
You didn't trust us… from the very beginning?

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.510
I was a double agent.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.550
I see through the eyes of both the Leaf and the Uchiha.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.970
To be frank, I don't know whose spy I was...

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.010
even to this day.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.390
Within the organization, I'm known as Tobi.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.300
I'm not an official member.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.550
I'm a newbie within the Akatsuki

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.970
who doesn't possess any spectacular jutsu.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.090
You should… treat me the same way.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.090
Why hide your true identity?

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.930
If word gets out that Madara Uchiha is still alive…

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.510
things could become complicated.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.800
Only the leader of Akatsuki, who we're meeting now,

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.260
knows my true identity.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.090
Why, it's Itachi.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.180
It's been a long time.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.680
Mr. Orochimaru…

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.300
That's right. You're from the same region.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.300
Is this going to be a touching reunion?

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.300
I heard the rumors.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.220
I knew it… so you were a shinobi like us…

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.220
"Like us"?

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.720
Those who consider bonds like the village, the clan and comrades...

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.840
to be a burden.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.180
The goal of the Akatsuki…

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.890
is a world of true peace among shinobi.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.340
Instead of the Five Great Shinobi Nations,

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.720
the Akatsuki shall rule the world.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.180
That's a big goal.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.050
That's why we're assembling skilled shinobi

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:12.970
without asking where they're from or what they've done.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.010
Itachi of the Hidden Leaf, we welcome you into the Akatsuki.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.140
From this moment on, reject the Hidden Leaf.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.260
From now… you are Itachi of the Akatsuki.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.470
SHU

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.890
Show the world pain…

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:53.800
Juzo...

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.050
Huh?

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.050
Form a two-man team with Itachi.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.760
Okay.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.430
Follow me, newbie.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.140
Yes.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.220
So Itachi, have you gotten used to the Akatsuki?

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:58.640
How would you feel about changing partners and teaming up with me?

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.680
I second changing partners!

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.430
I'd like you to think about this some more, leader.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.800
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Darkness of the Akatsuki."

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.010
You're one to talk, you damn snake!

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.930
ITACHI'S STORY – LIGHT AND DARKNESS: THE DARKNESS OF THE AKATSUKI.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:28.840
Tune in again!
