WEBVTT

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.070
Granny Chiyo.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.000
What's going on...?

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.530
That little girl shouldn't be able to move anymore...

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.870
Is Grandma controlling her?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.470
No, she wouldn't be able to make such complicated movements

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.400
in her condition...

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.730
That little girl... is moving under her own will...

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.400
How is it she can move?

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.470
I thought I nailed her with my poison.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.470
Sakura...You...

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.830
I used an antidote.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.270
When did you...get such a thing...?

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.900
When I made the antidote for Kankuro in the Village Hidden in the Sand...

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.170
I never imagined I'd find this many medicinal herbs

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.730
here in the Hidden Sand.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.970
However, it's quite difficult to grow medicinal herbs in this type of location.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.800
We only have a small amount of Scurvy Grass in particular...

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.130
No, this is more than enough.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.000
I can make three doses of antidote.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.570
I was able to make just three.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.400
I used one of them to heal Kankuro.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.030
You should be all right now, I think.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.000
Just lie there and rest for a while without moving

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.330
until the numbness goes away.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.630
I knew the enemy would use poison,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.230
so I made the other two into injections and brought them with me.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.230
I see... So that's how...

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.930
Yes, I used one of the two.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.300
However, the effects of the antidote will only last around three minutes.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.570
No matter how often I get hit with poison during that time,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.570
the effects of the medicine will turn all of it into harmless proteins.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.470
I see...

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.430
I couldn't let Sasori find out that I had this antidote...

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.270
I knew I'd have an opportunity

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.830
after he revealed his final intentions and let his guard down.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.530
So I couldn't use it until the very last moment.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.370
Now there's only one left...

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.600
I will hand this over to you, Granny Chiyo.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.530
Right...

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.000
Are you okay?!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.630
Don't tell me the poison was neutralized...

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.070
If you want to live that badly, I won't finish you off.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.330
However, that poison will kill you in less than three days...

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.700
Don't tell me they analyzed the components using the poison from back then...

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.370
No, that couldn't be.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.200
Even if by some chance they were able to analyze the components,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.330
they shouldn't be able to make an antidote that easily.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.970
The concoction of an antidote is so difficult

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.600
that even the slightest mistake is not permissible.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.670
Even I, who made the poison,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.670
needed a ratio chart for its concoction...

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.270
I'll heal you now.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.870
Now poison won't affect me for the next three minutes.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.270
Everything depends on those three minutes!

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.900
Right...

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.370
Grandma, huh...?

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.400
No, I'm the one who knows the level of medical ability

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.030
in the Hidden Sand more than anyone.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.170
I made a poison that

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.270
even she wouldn't be able to immediately create an antidote for.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.800
So this kid's also a Medical Ninja, huh...?

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.530
If I recall, she's from the Leaf...

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.230
The current Leaf Hokage Tsunade is known as a top-notch Medical Ninja...

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.530
Don't tell me... she made the antidote...?!

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.430
Three Minutes Between Life and Death 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.400
Sakura, my left hand's okay now.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.030
O-Okay...

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.430
Here I go!

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.070
Incredible strength...evasion... heals wounds...

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.330
They all utilize a considerable amount of Chakra...

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.870
She's probably already reached her limit...

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.230
Good grief.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:25.930
At this rate,

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.500
I won't be able to show my face to my man Sasori...

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.300
I've got to use the rest of my Detonation Clay

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.970
and show him that I'm a real artist!

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.370
And to do so...

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.370
I'll get that Copy Ninja out of the way!

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.130
It took a little time, but how about this?!

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.330
What?

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.770
Unlike the bird-type from earlier, these are sure small...

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.300
Is that so they won't get picked off by shuriken...?

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.670
And this amount...

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.570
Judging from the size of their hind legs...

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.970
I'd bet their special skill is jumping strength.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.900
Then I guess we'll go with a battle of speed!

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.870
Naruto! Hold on!

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.330
You're too slow, Kakashi Sensei! I'm going on ahead!

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.600
Don't do anything reckless on your own!

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.670
Yeah, I know.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.900
This might be a bit of a problem...

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.230
For the time being,

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.370
I stopped the bleeding of the large wounds...

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.730
I'll use all of my remaining Chakra to attack!

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.270
If I don't finish this during the next three minutes,

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.170
there won't be a next time!

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.870
The effects of the antidote will last three minutes...

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.700
We don't have any time.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.930
Can you fight right away, Granny Chiyo?

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.970
Very well.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.130
Let's end this!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.970
Now then...

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.400
this isn't the time to have a staring contest with these things.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.100
If I leave Naruto on his own, he could lose control at any moment.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.970
So by maintaining a fixed distance equal to how far I retreat,

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.530
they're preventing me from breaking through...

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.170
If so...!

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.930
They'd...better be following me...

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.530
Good work.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.400
That takes care of him.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.770
What? Kakashi Sensei?

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.800
Now at last, it's just the two of us.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.200
Don't scowl like that.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.270
Here I'm going to the trouble of letting you see your friend.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.170
Yeah-yeah, as a fellow Jinchuriki,

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.430
you can't keep your cool, can you?

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.130
Give Gaara...back!

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.730
Hold it!

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.600
Kakashi Sensei...!

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.530
Oh man, and I was totally convinced that you'd died.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.770
Sorry, it wasn't the real me that blew up.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.030
Next time, you'd better figure out how to get them

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.800
to tell the difference between a real body and a Shadow Clone...

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.370
If  there's a next time, that is...

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.430
Hold it!

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.900
That goes for you, too...

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.200
It's okay. We'll definitely get Gaara back.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:32.270
So calm down!

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.130
Sasori's gonna get mad at me again for not being prepared enough...

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.330
But it's not my style to think about every little detail

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.430
and always be perfectly prepared.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.130
Dealing with matters with a flexible mindset,

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.170
no matter what the situation,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.900
leads to developing sophistication as an artist.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:02.830
What should I do?

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.230
Listen up, Naruto.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.930
You're not accustomed to that kind of enemy.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.600
Not only that, he's a long-range type,

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.600
the worst match for someone like you; who specializes in close-range battle.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.530
There are only two ways to defeat this type of enemy.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.700
One is to draw the enemy into a close-range fight

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:26.800
and defeat them...

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.700
The other is to outdo the enemy with a long-range attack

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.970
and defeat them.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.630
But, how do we do that...?

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.270
No matter which method is taken,

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.400
your unit needs either a comrade who specializes in long-range attacks

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.970
or one who can use support Ninjutsu for long-range battles.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:53.130
In the event of having neither... it's impossible to defeat the enemy.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.570
Well, it'd be different

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.730
if you were as smart as Shikamaru, though.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.900
Stop beating around the bush!

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.630
If that's the case, then what about you Kakashi Sensei...?

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.230
Oh...me, huh?

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.300
A Jonin who's as smart as Shikamaru

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.430
and possesses support Ninjutsu for long-range battles.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.770
Then we've got what we need!

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.000
That's why I told you to calm down.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.670
Then we should get right to it...

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.930
It won't work out that easily.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.670
He won't leave himself open if we just chase him around.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.070
Okay, you're in range!

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.130
Mission accomplished.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:03.000
He infiltrated the Hidden Sand by himself and defeated Gaara.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.300
And most important... he's a member of the Akatsuki.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.330
Hey, this isn't the time for me to be taking it easy.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.100
Then what do we do?

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.770
All we can do is create an opening from our end.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.530
You and me together.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.500
If you were able to catch on to what I said,

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.400
then lend me an ear.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.730
I'll tell you the plan.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.030
Let's go, Sakura!

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.470
Right!

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:03.000
Heh... I'll admit it. You're an impressive kid.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.530
Who would've thought she could destroy the Third Kazekage...

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.330
It's useless to use other Human Puppets any longer.

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:18.870
I haven't used this since I joined the Akatsuki...

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.000
I can't remember when that was...

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.230
Wh-What's that?!

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:33.570
He hasn't aged at all since he left my side.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.370
He's exactly the same as before...

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:45.670
Scorpion And that's the reason why...

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.400
It's really been a long time...

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.430
since I used myself.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.870
He turned himself...

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.230
into a Human Puppet.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:21.230
Got it?

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.530
Yeah, I got it!

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.330
Let's go.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.170
What...?

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.200
If his entire body is a puppet...

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.370
Then it's safe to assume

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.500
all of the weapons inside his body are covered with poison...

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.200
What's the matter...?

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.770
It's already been over a minute since I gave myself the antidote shot...

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.800
Weren't you going to finish me off?

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.870
If you're not going to attack me...

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.900
The effects of the antidote will last less than two minutes.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.200
During that time...

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.000
somehow, I need to turn this into a close-range battle

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.670
and then finish him off...

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.600
Then I'll make the first move!

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.130
It's useless to hide!

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.900
Now...what will you do?

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.430
Open Ninja! Treasure Price Value!

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.400
Today, we had Granny Chiyo bring us these!

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.870
The finest works of Puppet Master Jutsu, by Monzaemon the First Puppeteer.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.100
If these are genuine, it'd be a historical finding!

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.400
There is no "if"'!

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.870
And how much value would the owner place on them?

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.270
These are priceless, of course!

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.000
I see. And how much value would the Connoisseur place on them?

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.730
These are truly fine works!

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.800
Ah, looks like they've made the decision! Open the price!

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.370
One...10...100... 1000...10,000!

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.730
Next time: Puppet Fight: 10 vs. 100!"
