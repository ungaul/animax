WEBVTT

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.230
Lost sight of my target.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.850
That spy pulled one over me. Should have figured out their intent…

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.640
Are you all right, Guy Sensei?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.600
I'll help you out!

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.730
Hey! Do not touch Guy right now!

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.430
He'll be experiencing the after-effects of the Eight Inner Gates soon.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.230
Even the slightest touch will cause him intense pain all over his body!

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.390
What? Really?

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.180
I'm sorry, ya know!

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.140
Quietly, quietly!

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.480
Because of the Water Prison Jutsu,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.270
I wasn't able to send a message about the intel leak.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.430
I think we can conclude that the enemy knows about this location.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.430
Which means we must act quickly to relocate Bee and Naruto!

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.310
The enemy will figure that out too and take immediate action!

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.180
I understand, but…

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.180
We will relocate them, but not by ship.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.350
They will remain on this island.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.230
What?

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.520
Leave him alone!

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.180
Bee! How did it go?

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.350
Not good!

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.310
Fool, ya fool.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.770
What do you mean when you say you'll relocate them,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.390
but they'll remain on this island?

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.100
You can't even find this island on a map.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.680
Even if they try to find it, it won't be that simple.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.390
The reason is because this island…

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.020
Y-You're huge!

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.310
But I am still a very, very small turtle.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.640
Impossible!

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.230
I've never seen nor heard of any turtle larger than you!

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.640
What did you say?!

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.980
Yes, a mobile stronghold, an island that can move.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.890
This is a colossal turtle reared by the Hidden Cloud since ancient times.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.140
Ouch!

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.600
We can say for sure that the enemy knows about this.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.230
However, this island is much safer

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.140
than returning to the Hidden Cloud Village by ship.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.560
Besides, hasn't Naruto been told that he's here on this island

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.390
for a top-secret ecological survey mission?

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.270
He'll get suspicious if we tell him we're already leaving.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.270
It seriously hurts!

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.310
The Super Secret S-Rank Mission

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.100
The Five Great Nations face an extremely critical situation.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.180
And as they prepare for the Fourth Great Ninja War,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.390
there is concern that the shinobi and samurai units will not be sufficient.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.350
Hence, a third military unit, made up of animals will be formed.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.810
To this end, it has been decided that a Jinchuriki

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.140
who is able to communicate with and understand animals…

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.390
One who loves animals like Naruto Uzumaki will be given

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.270
the task of selecting and organizing this animal unit.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.680
He will start by analyzing the biology of the animals,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.270
– Can we pass off… – then ascertain their strengths…

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.100
– such a childish trick? – and categorize them…

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.810
– We have to. – by gender and physical attributes.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.810
This is a top-secret S-rank mission!

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.730
Work diligently.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.640
Fifth Hokage Tsunade of the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.100
This… – This?! – This?!

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.060
This is the kind of brainy mission I've been waiting for!

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.730
It's kind of like the ones that Shikamaru always gets…

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.480
where you coordinate people!

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.810
We're talking animals.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.180
Leave it to Naruto… He didn't notice.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.230
They say that Jinchuriki are odd people.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.060
And that's putting it mildly.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.270
Granny Lady Tsunade understands!

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.310
She wants to test my leadership skills!

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.140
All right! I'm raring to go on this mission!

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.100
While you're doing that, I'll work on a new rap.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.140
I don't owe you anything anymore, not even a scrap! Yeah!

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.680
Don't "yeah" me! You have to help me!

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.520
You know all about the animals on this island, don't you?

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.310
Ask King!

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.060
He's the boss of this island!

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.140
King?

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.640
Hey! Can you help me out here?

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.270
I'm looking for the strongest ones on this island!

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.730
I really can't understand a thing you're saying!

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.180
Master King is saying to show him your proof of loyalty.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.310
Proof of loyalty?

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.480
Hey! That voice!

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.100
Condor the Ninja Ostrich?!

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.560
Did you run away again?!

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.560
Actually, I stowed away on your ship.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.560
Now I'm free!

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.140
Freedom!

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.600
Unfortunately for you,

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.140
the animals on this island are going to serve in an animal unit.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.850
Looking forward to working with you!

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.680
You've got to be kidding!

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.600
I don't want to go to war!

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.980
Really? Then listen up…

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.140
If you serve as my animal translator, I'll let you go.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.560
Damn it…

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.140
This is his proof…his kiss of love.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.270
Come on! Give me a break!

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.180
Master King says he understands.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.350
Besides him, the strong ones on this island are…

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.270
Don the giant koala.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.890
DON THE KOALA

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.140
Chuji the giant penguin.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.890
CHUJI THE PENGUIN

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.980
And the giant lame-o… I mean hippo, Hippo Boss.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.850
HIPPO BOSS

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.310
Keep them apart!

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.310
He says if they come face to face, they'll destroy the island.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.230
They're scary animals…

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.230
Yikes! They're already confronting each other!

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.310
King is totally the fiercest!

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.430
What are they saying?

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.390
This seems to be a four-way love affair involving one female.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.270
What did you say?!

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.770
Each one is claiming their affections for her and won't budge.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.060
Master King is demanding that she be brought here…

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.680
to choose among them.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.140
Are you sure about this?

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.100
What's that?

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.640
Huh? What the—?

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.140
This is mayhem.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.810
What? What's going on?

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.270
He's saying, "Armadiko is my girl!"

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:22.680
Huh?!

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.390
"Stop fighting!"

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.890
"Don't fight over me," she says.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.680
"I am not your commodity," she says.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.100
"I belong to this one," she says!

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.480
Huh?!

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.230
They said they're going to beat you to death!

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.100
This is perfect!

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.350
Now's my chance to slip away.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:11.180
No way am I going to war! I'm free!

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:18.100
Freedom!

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.560
Wait… I will go to the Eight and Nine Tails' location.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.430
What are you up to?

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.100
It's a good chance to build trust and solidify our relationship.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.100
Furthermore, Naruto, the Nine Tails,

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.350
always has someone close by in the form of Yamato,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.520
the copy of the First Hokage.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.390
I want him for my experiments.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.230
If I can't go, I'd settle for Zetsu's body.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.390
If you'd let me have some of him.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.350
Also, the revival of the Ten Tails isn't far off, is it?

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.930
You seem to be very well informed.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.520
I knew Orochimaru was secretly checking around, but…

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.730
According to intel that Kisame sent,

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.270
the Allied Shinobi Force is 80,000 strong.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.140
We also know what their military formation is like.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:27.100
But the key military power for this side is Zetsu here, right?

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.310
Just how much do you know?!

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.770
With the data I have gathered and my knowledge,

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.060
I can maximize Zetsu's strength.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.480
On the condition that you take me there.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.230
What are you going to do, Tobi?

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.270
Will you trust a guy like him?

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.180
If you bring me the Nine Tails, I will give you one of Zetsu.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:00.770
Follow me.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.270
This is…

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.430
the Gedo Statue.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.850
It's down here.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.230
This is… Yes, he's alive.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.180
That's Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.350
Well, he was merely cultivated from living cells

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.640
harvested from Senju during that battle.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.390
He's not conscious.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.100
But what you're interested in is down below.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.270
This is amazing. Since when?

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.730
However, there's a risk.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.350
I used a considerable amount of chakra

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.640
from the Tailed Beasts inside the Gedo Statue to create this.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.310
I want to preserve it as much as possible.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.600
If the revival of the Ten Tails is delayed,

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.180
it means my plans are delayed as well.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.930
How many are here?

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.730
Roughly 100,000.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.680
To arrive here to find that intel has been leaked…

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.310
We'll have to rethink our strategy.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.810
But as long as they know that

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.180
the Allied Shinobi Forces are aware of the leak,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.480
they will watch the situation.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.140
Perhaps it will be easier to lay some traps.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.930
What about the island?

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.100
Even if it's mobile, we can't let our guard down.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.310
Those two are their targets.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.730
They are sure to come in search of them.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:31.230
I established an escape route just for situations like this.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.640
In addition, the clouds hide it.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.770
The enemy will not be able to find it.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.600
If they come searching,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.430
the enemy will probably send a small reconnaissance team first.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:45.390
They won't infiltrate and try to divide our troops, will they?

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.100
There's no doubt Kisame put the coordinates of the island on the map.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.060
Even if we move, they will search the area thoroughly.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.600
We can't lose focus.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.390
In any case, send reinforcements.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.640
But it will be meaningless

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.850
if the enemy spots us mobilizing large groups.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.100
Send a few of the elite.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.140
I will go!

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.060
Lord Tsuchikage!

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.350
Old Ohnoki? Then I have no complaints.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:15.770
Same here.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.560
Someone who can fly through the air will move swiftly.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.180
Is it really all right?

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.270
Don't worry, Kazekage!

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.270
I am the Tsuchikage,

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.310
feared as the Fence Sitter of the Hidden Stone!

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.430
My back!

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.980
I will go, after all.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.140
I can ride my sand and be there in no time…

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.890
Fool! I said I would go.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.060
Well, you guys relax.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.480
We're off.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.140
It's the ocean from here on out.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.140
We'll have to fly.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.600
Yay! It's been so long since I flew!

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.230
This is going to be fun!

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.180
Don't get so excited, Akatsuchi!

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.230
We could be entering into a battle!

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.350
Yay!

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.140
I said to quit playing around, you brat!

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.310
You're so embarrassing!

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.140
Damn it! It does looks like fun!

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.980
But I can't get excited right now.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.930
Damn that Akatsuchi!

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.430
You're up next Kurotsuchi.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.600
Guess I have no choice…

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.270
Looks like you're awake at last.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.180
It's a different seal from Lord Orochimaru's.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.600
I won't bind you completely…Deidara.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.980
I don't know anything about art.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.140
And I know little about you.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:56.100
Well, my ninjutsu art isn't easy to understand… Hmm!

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:02.310
But I'm grateful to you. I once perfected the ultimate art.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.100
So now I can even go even further…

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.230
Speaking of which, that last explosion of yours…

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.230
It really didn't create a lot of buzz.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.270
I just told you!

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.140
My art is not easy to understand!

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.060
These things take time… Hmm…

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.310
I said to line up straight!

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.350
Hurry and get into the tunnel!

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.560
Listen up! The ecological survey will start once you're inside.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.060
Cut it out!

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.060
You want to fight again?

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:47.270
Damn it! It's tough moving all these animals.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.230
I win again! Rock, Scissors, Paper!

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.430
And I'm going to win again forever and ever!

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.560
Hey you there, octopus and crab!

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.350
Line up! Hey!

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.100
As long as there is a risk of the Akatsuki coming,

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.480
taking refuge inside the giant turtle shell is a wise move.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:09.600
Plus, Naruto is really taking this mission seriously.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.140
It will be disastrous if Naruto finds out about the war.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.100
He won't take the news quietly, he'd rush to the battlefield instead.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.020
We must prevent that at all cost.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.600
After all, this is a war to protect Naruto.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.140
Based on Kisame's intel, these are the coordinates.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.100
But they've already moved out.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.180
That was a light punch.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.310
I'm certain this person is…

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.980
Of all the people to ambush me,

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.350
it's none other than the Tsuchikage himself.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.310
I was just testing you out.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.770
Judging from your response, you're a clone!

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.140
It wasn't Madara, after all.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.520
And… What's going on with bird and Deidara?

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.270
Let's just say, they're almost real.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.480
However, you are…

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.100
a clay clone.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.930
Hey, Old Man Ohnoki.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.020
Long time no see!

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.180
You too, huh?

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.730
So what's going on with that Turtle Island?!

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.060
The Eight Tails and Nine Tails are there.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.520
The Eight and Nine Tails?

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.100
So that means that damn Naruto is there! Hmm!

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:20.770
Isn't he the perfect opponent to "exhibit" your art to?

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.180
First, stop the Turtle Island's movements.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.230
Deidara, make me a big one.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.100
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Artist Returns"

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.600
Let's make this one flashy! Hmm! THE ARTIST RETURNS

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.770
THE ARTIST RETURNS

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.350
ROCK LEE'S SILLY CHRONICLES PART 3

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.270
Guy Sensei!

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:42.770
Lee!

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.270
When it's necessary to use the Drunken Fist…

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:50.140
Eat this! A Chocolate Bomb that only good children can eat.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.100
Yes, Guy Sensei!

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.730
Down the hatch!

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.390
That's so weird… What's the matter?

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.600
I had a bomb right here, but…

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:09.020
Tune in again!
