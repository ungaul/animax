WEBVTT

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.780
My apologies for embarrassing you, Kinkaku and Ginkaku,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.480
long revered as the shining light of the Cloud.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.900
I don't mean to disrespect you,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.570
but I'll have to shame you some more.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.530
I may end up taking the shine out of your silver and gold…

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.280
With one strike of my Gale Style!

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.400
Even though this is drab…

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.110
Calm down, Raikage.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.320
You are the Supreme Commander.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.440
You just don't know how frightening the Gold and Silver Brothers are.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.480
I can't believe I just heard you say the word "frightening."

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.940
It's not that I'm scared…

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.650
They are the most reviled criminals in the history of the Hidden Cloud.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.690
The brothers staged a coup d'état during

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.780
the alliance ceremony with the Hidden Leaf

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.530
and attacked the Second Raikage and Second Hokage.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.530
It is said they use four of the Treasured Tools

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.980
of the Sage of Six Paths.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.940
They left the Second Hokage near death. I know that much.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.150
What?! These two are bathed in the Nine Tails' chakra!

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.730
Incredible chakra!

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.280
The Nine Tails' chakra… I didn't know they possessed it.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.190
Long ago, it seems the Hidden Cloud made an attempt

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.650
to capture the Nine Tails…

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.400
and the Nine Tails apparently devoured

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.230
the Gold and Silver Brothers.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.480
But the brothers kept thrashing around in its belly,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.940
forcing the Nine Tails to vomit them.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.530
Ever since then,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.190
they have been infused with the Nine Tails' chakra.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.480
Not surprising, considering they were inside the Nine Tails' belly

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.530
for two weeks.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.860
It's hard to believe, but what about the rumors that they are

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.150
able to wield the Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths?

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.780
Normal humans cannot handle the Treasured Tools.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.030
They absorb massive amounts of chakra from its user

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.570
that would kill the average man.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.860
Except ones who harbor the Nine Tails' chakra,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.110
like those two monsters.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.570
They are shinobi with monstrous chakra

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.480
who wreak havoc and fear nothing, not even the Nine Tails.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.530
What scares me is the thought of our subordinates

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.650
who must face them…

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.170
Forbidden Words

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.040
I don't like that tone you're using toward your seniors.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.330
I'll shut you up!

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.670
It can't be helped.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.330
Seems like a lot of time has passed. No one knows about us anymore.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.290
Samui, Atsui.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.130
If you're really the Gold and Silver Brothers

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.880
we read about in our scrolls,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.830
don't talk to me like we're comrades.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.710
It's not cool.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.130
Well, well… For someone who's always cool,

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.540
you're quite hot right now.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.210
I sense that you guys are pretty formidable.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.420
Let's do this, Ginkaku!

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.130
All right, Kinkaku!

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.290
What is that?!

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.500
No doubt about it, those are the ninja tools

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.960
of the Gold and Silver Brothers that were described in the scroll!

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.540
Four of the five ultimate ninja tools,

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.920
which the Hidden Cloud collected long ago.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:09.920
The Kokinjo binds its victim and

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.880
squeezes out the victim's spirit word!

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.500
The Shichiseiken severs and curses that spirit word…

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.130
The Benihisago records the spirit word

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.040
and seals the speaker with in!

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.960
And the Bashosen conjures up all five chakra natures:

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.880
fire, water, lightning, wind and earth!

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.670
Sorry to interrupt your lecture, Sis, but…

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.210
Let me handle this!

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.250
Cloud Style! Flame Slice!

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.170
Those ninja tools look nasty,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.710
but ultimately, they're just mere tools!

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.830
They're no match for our ninjutsu that's imbued with our hot souls!

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.210
Atsui, wait!

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.750
Stay cool until I finish!

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.880
Damn it! He's too hot-headed!

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.960
They talk too much… This is perfect.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.500
I'll take the one in the back!

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.580
Got it, Ginkaku!

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.040
Leave the others to me!

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.580
The nerve of the guy… Avoiding someone like me,

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.290
with a hot fighting spirit, to go for Darui!

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.710
Did you think you could avoid my hot-spirited attack

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.210
with a crowd of bodies!?

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.500
Pay attention, Atsui!

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.960
Stay cool and look around you!

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.790
That punch was pretty hot!

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.630
Damn it!

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.500
Atsui, Samui! Are you all right?

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.210
Don't look away, kid!

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.540
Change places, Kinkaku!

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.540
Right, Ginkaku.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.880
Can't I even stop one foe?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.540
Forgive me, Samui, Atsui…

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.580
Whoa… I'm your opponent this time!

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.290
That Kinkaku fellow packed a pretty hot punch!

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.830
And this time it's Ginkaku, eh?

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:05.710
Squeeze them!

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.170
Kokinjo!

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.630
What is that?!

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.000
The Kokinjo in my left hand squeezes out the Spirit Word

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.630
of anyone that touches it!

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.040
Curse them! Shichiseiken!

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.710
HOT COOL

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.000
Record them!

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.710
Benihisago!

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.540
All right. My side is done, Kinkaku.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.000
He's been struck… That's what you think, you jerks!

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.790
It's our turn now!

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.920
Didn't I tell you to let me finish?

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.500
Now listen. Don't say another word.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.080
What do you mean?

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.920
A Curse Mark Jutsu and Sealing Jutsu have been used on us.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.710
Our Spirit Words have been taken hostage.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.580
The word we've uttered the most since our birth.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.710
HOT COOL If we say that word…

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.500
We'll be sucked into that gourd and sealed away.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.420
You know a lot, don't you?

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.630
It seems the passage of time revealed a lot of things.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.790
The word we've said the most is now forbidden?

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.270
We're not playing some silly word game…

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.630
HOT COOL We're not playing some silly word game…

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.080
HOT COOL So drab… HOT COOL I see.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.130
Bashosen!

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.580
What?

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:48.170
What is the hot word I love to use the most?!

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.960
You probably don't have to think too hard to figure it out.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.580
Scroll of Fire!

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.880
Hot!

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.710
Damn it!

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.040
Stupid…

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.710
Atsui!

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.290
There's an old saying, "Silence is golden."

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.250
The mouth is the source of calamity.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.630
Right, Ginkaku?

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.500
Yeah, Kinkaku!

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.000
This is what happens when you can't keep your mouth shut.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.250
Words are used to lie.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.040
They're merely tools for deceiving people.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.710
If you make fun of words, Bee will let you have it.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.290
Bee? Never heard of him.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.710
If you move, the girl dies.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.500
And I'm not lying.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.330
I'm sorry, Samui.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.130
Just as I expected.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.170
I must say, you're both true Hidden Cloud shinobi.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.630
Gale Style!

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.710
Laser Circus!

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.040
He's fast.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.000
And to top it off, it was a Precision Ninjutsu?

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.630
Don't take us lightly, brat!

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.000
Owww…

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.380
Kinkaku did a good job of applying the Kokinjo.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.380
This one's first.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:44.960
What's going on?!

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.880
She didn't say a word, but Samui's been sucked in?!

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:50.920
Curse him!

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.380
Shichiseiken!

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.670
His arm has already regenerated!

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.750
Record him, Benihisago!

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.380
I can figure out what my forbidden word is.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.460
This is drab!

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.670
That was pretty drab.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:25.500
DRAB

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:30.150
DRAB My forbidden word…

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.110
The word I've used most often in my life is without a doubt,

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.150
DRAB "drab."

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.440
As long as I don't use it…

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.440
I won't be sucked into that gourd.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.230
However…Samui didn't say a word but she was sucked in.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.400
Which means…

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.190
If you stay quiet for a fixed amount of time,

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.610
you can get sucked in…

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.190
Am I right?

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.320
Sharp of you to notice.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.070
It seemed no one had figured that out yet.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.530
You're pretty smart.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.980
"Silence is golden"? As if…

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.150
They also say that, "speech is silver"!

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.440
Especially when spoken with a forked tongue!

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.480
In this case, silence is the most forbidden taboo.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.820
Didn't I tell you?

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.440
Words are tools with which to fool others.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.150
In the shinobi world,

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.980
trickery and betrayal are fine military tactics.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.940
The spoken word is also a ninja tool.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.730
Is it any wonder that you two are symbols of disgrace

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.480
among the Hidden Cloud?

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.480
How dare you say that, you third-rate underling?!

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.980
You're just another pawn for the Raikage…

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.730
A mere ninja tool.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.530
A mere ninja tool!

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.360
So you can cut the drivel!

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.190
What the hell is wrong with the ninja of today?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.320
Boss…

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:55.690
I'm sorry.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.070
I was chosen to be your bodyguard and yet you lost your left arm…

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.820
Don't worry about it.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.150
But…

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.480
I don't miss my left arm.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.860
After all, I have two right arms.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.230
Two?

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.940
This and…

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.530
you.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.610
How about including Cee and making it three?

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.730
Well, all right.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.190
You can never have too many.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.480
I am the Boss's courageous right-hand man…

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.730
Not some timid rabbit!

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.030
Hey, Ginkaku… What, Kinkaku?!

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.480
Get ready for Benihisago.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.030
I see.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.230
Why?

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.730
I didn't say "drab."

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.610
I am the Boss's courageous right-hand man.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.110
Not some timid rabbit!

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.820
I am the Boss's courageous right-hand man…

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.320
Not some timid rabbit!

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.280
Timid rabbit is…

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.650
Drab!

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.230
DRAB

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:20.400
Damn it!

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.780
Darui…

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.820
I want you to be lead one of the Allied Shinobi companies…

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.730
as my right-hand man!

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:30.780
My apologies, Boss…

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.530
I was so proud to be your right-hand man…

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.190
My apologies, Samui…Atsui…

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.070
My apologies, everyone…

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:45.530
My apologies…

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.820
My sincerest apologies…

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.070
Ready to move on, Ginkaku?

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.940
Right, Kinkaku.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.110
Why?!

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.070
Damn it!

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:11.530
I touched the Kokinjo!

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.440
Why didn't he…?

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.440
DRAB APOLOGIES

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.280
APOLOGIES

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:24.610
I…

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.400
I apologize about the desks and the wall…

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.110
My apologies for embarrassing you, Kinkaku and Ginkaku,

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.230
long revered as the shining light of the Cloud.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.150
Apologies, Samui…

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.440
I guess that means I'm a pretty humble guy.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.400
That's not so bad.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.570
I'm certain it was "dull."

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.570
My apologies, Boss.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.480
My apologies, everyone…

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.570
My apologies, Samui…Atsui…

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.780
I'm so sorry.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.030
Don't tell me… While he was being sucked in,

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.820
his most-used word switched places with his second-most uttered word?

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.730
Curse him! Shichiseiken!

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.030
Record him! Benihisago!

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.070
I think that's the way it goes!

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.480
Why you…

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:42.150
This uses up so much…chakra…

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.440
I feel like I'm gonna drop first.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:54.570
It's true…words can be used as tools to trick people.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.320
But when it really counts, the spoken word…

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.480
After all, I have two right arms.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.480
This…

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.480
and you!

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.570
The spoken word is…

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.570
is a precious thing that conveys the truth that's right here.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.110
Help me…Kinkaku.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.570
KINKAKU That's why I'm going to seal you now.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.280
Kinkaku!

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.900
Samui… Atsui… It's all thanks to you.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.530
I swear I'll save you later.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.570
But now…there's one more.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:58.820
Why you…

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.480
How dare…

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.690
How dare you!

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:25.610
What?!

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.820
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.610
This is…!

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.980
How dare you do that to Ginkaku…?!

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.780
He looks exactly like the Nine Tails' Jinchuriki!

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:38.900
It's a strategy from HQ!

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.480
We'll strike Kinkaku with the Ino-Shika-Cho Formation.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.910
Until they get here, we'll have to hold this location down!

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.400
– All right! – All right!

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.120
He may have the power of the Nine Tails,

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.780
but we have the power of the Ino-Shika-Cho bond!

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.910
