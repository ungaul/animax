WEBVTT

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.230
No way!

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.470
It’s useless.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.230
Th-This is…

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.900
Itachi?

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.100
The Forbidden Visual Jutsu

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.800
Die…

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.670
Amaterasu!

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.200
I commend you for placing me under genjutsu.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.730
However…

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.470
Sasuke! Now's your chance!

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.570
Why did you stop?

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.530
I was aware of your genjutsu long ago.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.500
It is a far cry from Itachi's masterful Tsukuyomi

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.230
in which he freely manipulated time.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.930
A Curse Mark that paralyzes the body.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.930
He must have placed it back then.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.730
Sasuke… You can't move?

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.730
I don't need to use jutsu on her.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.370
Taijutsu, huh?

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.530
It seems he wants to preserve his chakra.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.970
Release!

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.300
The flow of Danzo's chakra has changed.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.800
What's he up to?

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.900
If Sasuke knows the truth about Itachi,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.670
then the Akatsuki must know as well.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.570
It's impossible to try to conceal the information any longer.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.770
Why?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.500
Why was it necessary to save the life of such trash, Itachi?

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.870
Sasuke!

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.230
Look, Itachi…

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.500
at the sorry state he’s in.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.630
He’s your…ultimate mistake.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.200
But he could not kill… his little brother.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.770
He cried tears of blood

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.870
and killed every shred of feeling he had inside him,

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.670
then he killed his brethren for the sake of his village.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.330
But he just couldn’t kill you.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.070
Do you understand what that means?

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.700
To him,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.730
your life was more precious…

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.570
than the village.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.670
He broke free from the Curse Mark.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.270
Is that Susano'o?

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.000
It's completely different from before!

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.700
Is this Sasuke?!

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.530
This chakra… He's no longer the Sasuke from before.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.300
All right.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.030
His hatred has matured and gained in power.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.900
And his body is responding to it.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.530
This is going well.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.130
He doesn’t need my help at all.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.430
He's aiming for my landing.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.070
I can't weave the signs in time!

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.130
It can't be helped!

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.000
I managed to alter its path.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.970
Danzo's chakra level plummeted with that jutsu!

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.600
Why did he go to that extent just to dodge Susano'o's attack?

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.730
The jutsu this guy's been using is supposed to make him immortal.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.600
So the jutsu he released earlier was his own.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.600
That was Wood Style.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.000
I see. So that's why…

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.870
With that many Sharingan,

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.900
I knew there had to be a secret

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.370
for someone not from the Uchiha to be able to use them.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.370
Damn Orochimaru…

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.670
It seems he and Danzo have been in close contact.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.230
He had the cells of the First Hokage, Hashirama,

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.130
implanted in him to enhance his physical energy.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.430
That's how he was able to control so many Sharingan.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.830
No, he can die!

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.630
If he hadn’t countered that earlier attack, he would have died.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.570
That's why he exhausted so much chakra!

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:24.370
Sasuke!

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.600
That's the real Danzo!

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
The jutsu that makes him invincible is broken right now!

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.570
He's vulnerable!

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.030
So that woman’s a Sensory-Type Ninja!

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.500
She figured me out.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.930
But it's too late.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.570
Yes!

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.530
No…

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.700
The moment Danzo weaved a sign,

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.400
something about his chakra changed.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.530
He activated the jutsu!

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.830
I’m probably the only one who can see that.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.030
Susano'o's attack just then was probably too late.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.100
Damn it!

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.200
He recast the jutsu again,

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.570
but all three eyes are still closed.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.570
As far as I can tell, he has ten Sharingan in his arm,

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.030
as well as the First Hokage's cells.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.500
The power of the Uchiha and Hashirama.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.700
Looks like he intends to control the Nine-Tails.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.930
So he's after Naruto too.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.430
Danzo's chakra level has decreased some more.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.370
This jutsu carries a lot of risk after all.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.270
That’s why he needed to undo the jutsu once before.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:17.600
Release!

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.600
In order to preserve his chakra!

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.630
And another thing.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.530
The Sharingan in his right arm and his jutsu are definitely linked.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.430
The secret lies in the eyes that close!

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.700
There’s no mistake.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.670
This is the Visual Jutsu that was forbidden even among the Uchiha.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.900
Izanagi…

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.200
I didn’t expect to see it here, of all places.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.800
Sasuke!

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.570
Stay calm!

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:16.570
The only thing I can do right now is analyze Danzo's jutsu!

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.100
Izanagi…

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.330
Where in a brief moment in time,

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.130
anything disadvantageous to the user of the jutsu,

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.870
like damage or death, can be rewritten as a dream.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.300
And…

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.300
anything advantageous, such as the user’s attacks,

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.100
is kept as part of reality.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.430
The ability to control the space between fantasy and reality.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.500
An ultimate genjutsu cast upon oneself.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:26.300
And the eye that uses Izanagi loses its light,

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.500
never to open again.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.400
But…

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.630
The number of eyes he possesses…

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.030
The duration of Izanagi varies with each user.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.000
He wanted to extend the time by whatever means

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.530
so he agreed to become a test subject for Orochimaru.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.200
Damn that Madara…

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.300
It doesn't seem like he plans to join the battle,

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.100
but I cannot take any chances.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.300
I must reserve enough power to take him on.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.430
It will take some time

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.300
for the right eye I used at the summit to recover.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.330
However, this Susano'o is not easy to deal with.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.470
That arrow attack is difficult to dodge.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.830
And I can’t undo Izanagi yet.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.500
I’ll have to bet on this next minute.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.770
Summoning Jutsu!

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.400
This Summoning…

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.600
It’s the Baku. A monster that devours nightmares.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.030
It's much larger than I imagined.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.970
I will not lose sight of Danzo!

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.030
No matter what!

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.900
With this, Susano'o won't be able to move.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.130
I’ll take advantage of the Baku's suction power

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.470
to increase the force.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.970
Wind Style: Vacuum Blast Barrage!

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.770
The vulnerable spot in Susano’o…

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.200
is here!

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.470
Fire Style… Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.770
Using Fire Style in this situation…

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.130
You made clever use of the wind that was being inhaled, Sasuke.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:31.430
53…54…55… 56…57…58…59…60.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.230
Those eyes… One closes every 60 seconds or so.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.870
And during that time, his chakra continues to drop drastically.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.570
Which means…

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:51.900
that right arm shows how much time that weird jutsu has left.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.270
Four more left!

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.200
Or roughly 240 seconds,

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.730
approximately four minutes is the time limit of that jutsu!

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.000
While his jutsu is active,

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.500
Sasuke's attacks are made ineffective

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.770
while Danzo's attacks are successful.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.200
The way this jutsu works…

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:19.370
Danzo intends to bring Sasuke down while his jutsu is still active.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.530
Even with a mutual strike, Danzo will win!

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.930
Sasuke! I figured out a little bit of that guy's jutsu!

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.070
Listen! All right?

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.700
When all ten of your eyes have closed on your right arm,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.170
your jutsu will be undone, isn't that so?

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.600
You knew about Izanagi?

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.400
As I suspected!

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.330
You tricked me?

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.870
What a crafty brat.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.700
Y-You fool! Why are you engaging him?

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.600
Sasuke! Get away from him now!

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.270
Prolong the battle!

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.300
However, that wouldn't make sense.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.530
In that case, Danzo would simply undo Izanagi.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.870
If that happens, Sasuke, who’s used up so much strength,

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.100
would be at an overwhelming disadvantage.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.800
Sasuke is pressing Danzo

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.730
with the super-fast, high-powered Susano’o

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.500
to force him to continue using Izanagi and thus use it up.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.330
Sasuke figured this out early on.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.300
Now, who will be exhausted first?

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.870
He's putting his remaining strength into a chakra blade.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.270
This is the deciding moment.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:31.570
How many Uchiha did you kill to get that right arm?!

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.730
It was Itachi who enabled me to get it.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.900
You made him do it!

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.970
Shisui’s eye has recovered at last.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.400
Nevertheless, Sasuke is no longer useful with that injury.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.570
As I thought,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.000
Madara’s the one I need to place under genjutsu and manipulate.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:53.330
I can’t waste time since I have sustained injuries too.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.170
I can’t die yet.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.870
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Danzo Shimura"

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.400
I win.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.600
Tune in again!
