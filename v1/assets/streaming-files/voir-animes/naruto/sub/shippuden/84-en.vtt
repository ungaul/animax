~Thanks for watching on Crunchyroll.com~

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.130
Kakashi Chronicles ~ A Boy's Life on the Battlefield ~ Part 1

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.130
This is bad!

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.900
At this rate, I'll be killed!

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.730
Can I make it?!

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.800
Did I make it?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.230
No, Obito, you're late!

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.330
What time did you think we were supposed to meet?!

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.570
If you're a full-fledged ninja

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.730
you're expected to follow the rules!

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.100
Well... I was on the way,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.930
but an old lady carrying a load asked me for directions...

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.630
And I got something in my eye...

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.470
Okay! That's a lie, isn't it?!

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.300
That's enough, Kakashi.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.600
Obito showed the old lady the way...

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.700
Isn't that right?

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.770
I carried her bag too!

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.800
You're too lenient, Sensei.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.070
Besides, there's no way that some needy person appears

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.400
before Obito each and every time!

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.670
Those who break the rules and regulations are regarded as scum!

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.900
Isn't that so?!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.900
Don't you have a shred of kindness in your heart?!

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.030
All you ever talk about are rules and regulations!

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.200
The main thing is your own self-control.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.570
Now stop it, both of you. We're all on the same team.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.600
You're too easy on Obito, Rin.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.670
This is an important day for me too.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.100
Y-You're right...

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.200
What was it again?

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.270
As of today, Kakashi is a jonin like me.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.100
And in order to increase our efficiency,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.800
we'll be splitting into two teams.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.600
After all, presently the Leaf Village is at an unprecedented low

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.630
on military strength.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.270
Splitting up? Then... Yes, that's right.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.100
Kakashi will be captain of a three-man squad with Obito and Rin.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.830
And I'll be working alone.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.400
Remember, we talked about this the other day, Obito...

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.530
About getting Kakashi a gift.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.300
Sorry... I wasn't listening.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.700
This is my gift. A custom-made kunai knife.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.930
It's sort of heavy and odd-shaped,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.600
but once you get accustomed to it, it's easy to use.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.930
Thank you.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.470
And this is from me.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.800
Here! A personalized special medkit...

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.700
I adjusted things a little, to make it easier to use.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.900
Thanks.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.270
Wh-What's with that hand?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.330
I don't have anything to give you!

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.830
Well... I don't mind.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.800
It wouldn't have been anything worthwhile anyway.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.700
Getting something useless would only get in the way.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.230
I still can't figure out why you became a jonin!

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.100
You should talk.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.230
I'm Obito Uchiha of the  Uchiha clan!

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.000
I'll surpass you some day! The minute my "Sharingan" awakens!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.300
Everyone in the Uchiha clan is elite, right?

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.170
So you shouldn't have to rely on something like that.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.270
What...?!

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.870
Stop it, you two!

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.230
Can I start to explain the mission to you?

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.470
We're close to the border.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.870
Got it? It's this line.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.930
It shows where the Land of Earth is currently invading

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.770
the Hidden Grass Village.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.500
Our enemies are the Hidden Stone Ninja...

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.070
We have received word that 1000 ninja already make up the front line.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.300
They've advanced considerably since the last time.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.600
The Land of Fire shares borders with the Hidden Grass.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.530
We should have stepped in long ago.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.400
Judging by the size of this advance...

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.200
they must have an efficient system for reinforcement.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.170
Hence, our mission is here... at Kannabi Bridge.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.400
To crush one's enemy at the battlefront requires

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.330
an immense number of ninja.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.970
So ninja like us, who focus on sabotage missions,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.170
are forced to work in small, select teams.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.870
The bridge...you say?

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.270
Then it's an infiltration mission?

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.130
Right! Team Kakashi...

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.400
Your mission is to infiltrate the enemy's rear territory.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.730
You will destroy this bridge, which is used to transport supplies and reinforcements.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.530
And when this is done, withdraw immediately.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.770
- Yes sir! - Yes sir!

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.730
And you, Sensei?

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.630
I will face the enemy directly on the battlefront.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.530
I'll create a diversion for you.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.600
In any case, Kakashi is your captain today.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.400
We'll travel together to the border,

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.000
but after that your mission commences!

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.200
- Yes sir! - Yes sir!

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.800
Nice...Kakashi.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.300
They noticed... They're pretty good.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.970
He's...

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.100
No, that can't be...

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.100
I'll just watch the situation.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.270
One...

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.830
No! Be on guard, everyone. There are twenty of them.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.000
Although it's probably a Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.030
I think you're right. Sensei... I'll attack.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.800
Can you cover me?

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.830
Don't be hasty, Kakashi. I think you should back me up.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.770
Sensei... I'm the captain today!

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.300
I want to test a new jutsu I've been working on.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.130
He's coming...

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.400
Chidori!

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.130
What is that jutsu?!

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.900
Wh-What an incredible chakra...

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600
Here I go!

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.700
No matter what their numbers are,

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.200
with this jutsu, I can take them down in a flash.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.770
It's just like your nickname.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.230
Besides... Sensei... You said it yourself.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.030
Right now, I'm the captain.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.100
The rule says that the team must obey its captain's orders, Sensei!

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.630
To think he'd attack head on...

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.430
Your kunai attacks helped me pinpoint your location.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.630
Here I go!

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.930
He's fast!

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.300
Damn! It's a Shadow Clone...!

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.370
Then on to the next!

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.100
Don't let your guard down!

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.400
Yes sir!

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.130
That's number 18!

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.200
Don't get cocky, brat!

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.030
Kakashi!

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.700
I was barely able to counter that brat.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.800
But that yellow-haired guy's moves are...

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.700
I marked him...

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.900
Sensei's Transportation Technique is ...so fast!

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.670
N-No way... Are you the "Yellow Flash of the Leaf"?!

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.230
Those of us from the Land of Earth...

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.830
have been taught by our commanders to run when we see you.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.070
I finally understand what they meant.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.600
Kakashi's wound is serious...

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.830
We'll retreat and regroup.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.370
I'm all right!

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.870
No, you're not!

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.830
All because you ignored Sensei's warnings and charged ahead!

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.330
I don't need to listen to that.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.400
Not from the "Uchiha elite" who was whining in fear back there!

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.870
I-I got some dust in my eye and started tearing up, that's all!

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.830
Do you know the 25th rule of Shinobi Conduct?

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.630
The rule says a ninja must not show tears!

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.630
Hey... Stop it, you two...

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.200
That's enough, both of you!

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.630
Kakashi, rules and regulations are indeed important.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.070
But that isn't everything. Didn't I teach you...?

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.670
There are times when the situation requires

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.700
impromptu responses against the enemy.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.770
There, you see?!

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.500
Obito, you too!

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.630
There's no way dust can get into your eyes when you have goggles on.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.170
If you're going to advocate self-control, don't just mouth the words.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.830
Act strong too.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.400
And one other thing...

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.270
Kakashi... You shouldn't use that jutsu anymore.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.630
From what I could see,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:00.530
your focal point concentrated attack undoubtedly has power and speed...

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.700
But it makes you move too fast to ascertain the opponent's counterattack.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.570
It's still an imperfect jutsu.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.730
Before we part... I'll tell you one more thing.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.170
For a ninja, the most important thing is teamwork.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:28.770
Sensei...

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.130
What's the matter?

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.500
I know... that teamwork is important.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.100
But...

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.630
Kakashi always criticizes me about how I lack discipline, so...

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:56.430
I mean... I know that I'm the black sheep of the elite Uchiha Clan...

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.930
And I admit that Kakashi is an awesome guy...

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.870
Kakashi is the son of the genius ninja, Sakumo Hatake,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.930
feared as the "White Fang" of the Leaf.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.900
Even the legendary names of the Leaf's Three Great Ninja paled

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.200
before his father's.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.570
His childhood years were spent under the shadow of such a genius...

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.830
So I guess it can't be helped if, at times, he finds you lacking.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.970
White Fang...

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.530
That's right... I've heard of him too.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.370
The hero who died protecting the village.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.570
Kakashi never said a word about that...

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.700
He was a great man...

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.400
Someone respected by everyone in the village,

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.800
and naturally, by Kakashi himself.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.870
That is, until that incident...

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.630
Incident?

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.770
Perhaps, I shouldn't be telling you something like this...

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.730
But since you're on the same team as Kakashi,

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.100
I want you to know.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.170
What happened...?

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.300
Kakashi's father, Sakumo,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.730
took his own life after being slandered.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.300
Five years ago, he was the leader of an extremely difficult mission

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.530
and infiltrated enemy territory.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.670
He was forced to make a choice.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.730
The mission or his comrades' lives...

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.800
Of course, according to the rules of the village,

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.530
completing the mission was the right thing to do.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.100
However, in order to save his comrades,

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.830
he suspended the mission.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:36.570
That resulted in grave losses to the Land of Fire and the village,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.370
and he was blamed for it.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.700
What's more, the very comrades he saved also criticized him.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.230
The whole ordeal took its toll on Sakumo's health,

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.930
physically and mentally.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.070
And finally, he took his life.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.600
From then on, Kakashi never uttered a word about his father,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.970
and he strictly began to adhere to every rule and regulation.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:11.930
Obito...

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.100
Obito... Try to understand, even if it's just a little.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.930
Kakashi means well.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.470
It's healing well.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.700
But don't over-exert yourself or you'll open up the wound.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.630
Yeah.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.370
Let's start heading out.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.970
- Yes sir! - Yes sir!

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.170
We'll be splitting up from this point. Good luck to you all.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.330
The enemy the other day was doing surveillance alone.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.300
But from here on out, we'll be fighting teams.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:47.770
Be careful...

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.800
Let's get going...

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.400
Captain.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.030
All right... Let's go!

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.270
- Yes sir! - Yes sir!

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.570
Scatter!

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:14.300
Hey... Mahiru went out for surveillance and hasn't come back.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.270
You don't think those young brats killed him, do you?

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.700
Well then, let's ask them.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.800
Camouflage Jutsu...

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.400
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.770
We're taking this one.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:08.770
Wait!

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.900
Damn it!!

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.130
Obito! Don't go after them!

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:22.800
What?!

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.000
Do you realize what you just said?!

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:26.830
Yeah...

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.700
The two of us will continue this mission.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.570
And Rin? What about Rin?!

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.970
Rin comes later.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.730
The enemy wants to find out what we're up to.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.000
They won't kill her right away.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.200
And luckily, Rin is a Medical Ninja.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.200
So even if she ends up a prisoner of war, she'll probably be treated cordially...

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.000
On the condition that she treat the wounded on their side.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.530
The problem is if the enemy learns about our strategy.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.900
If they obtain that information, no doubt,

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.630
they'll immediately increase the security on the bridge.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.130
That will make our mission much more difficult.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.470
You're assuming Rin's safety under baseless assumptions!

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.770
What if those guys just now are lackeys who don't give a damn?!

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.170
Right now, saving Rin takes priority over the mission!

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.630
A ninja...

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.170
must sacrifice a comrade in order to carry out a mission.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:21.970
That is the rule.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.330
If we fail in this mission,

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.930
it is possible that the war will be prolonged

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.330
and many more lives will be sacrificed.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.670
That's just an assumption!

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.330
And for something like that,

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.670
you're willing to simply abandon a comrade

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.770
who's been through life and death with you?!

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.000
When you and I were wounded,

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.130
Rin saved our lives with her Medical Ninjutsu!

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.370
If she hadn't been there, we'd both be dead by now!

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.700
That was Rin's duty.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.630
I don't like you, after all!

00:17:55.030 --> 00:18:00.000
I don't care. I'm the captain. You will obey me.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.200
Whatever the situation, in order to keep the team together,

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.570
one person gives the orders.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.270
That is why we have the rule that states

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.870
that members must obey the team captain.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.130
Obito, you're not strong.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.730
That is why I was chosen as captain of this team.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.070
Then why won't you try to save Rin?!

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.070
As captain, you're strong.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.530
Strong enough to save your comrades, right?!

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.330
If you give in to your emotions even for a moment

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.600
and fail your mission, you will regret it later.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.530
That is why our code of conduct forbids any emotional feelings.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.670
You should know that.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.770
Rin...

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.130
Rin was concerned about your well-being.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.100
That's why she gave you that medkit.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.330
She even sewed on a protective amulet inside it!

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.500
The medkit and Medical Ninjutsu are superb systems

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.330
developed by the Hidden Leaf

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.570
in order to increase the success rate of our missions.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.930
But I told you yesterday, didn't I?

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.370
"Getting something useless would only get in the way."

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.300
Something useless?

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.630
To carry out his mission, useful tools are essential to a ninja.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.330
Something like emotions are useless.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.900
Are you serious...?!

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.700
Do you seriously believe that?!

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.000
Yeah...I do...

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.700
Forget it.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.900
You and I have been like water and oil from the start.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.870
I'm going to rescue Rin!

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.830
You don't understand anything...!

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.170
Not about what happens if you break the rules...

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.630
I believe that the White Fang was a true hero...

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.400
Sure in the world of ninja,

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.900
those who break the rules and regulations are regarded as scum...

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.870
But...

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.270
those who abandon their comrades... are worse than scum!

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.370
I'm gonna be trash anyway, so I choose to break the rules.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.830
And if that doesn't make me a true ninja...

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.170
Then I'll crush this so-called "ninja"!!

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:41.000
When I think back, I'm filled with regret.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.070
I was a cocky brat who had just been promoted to jonin,

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.470
and every other word I uttered was about rules and regulations.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.430
But frankly, I knew nothing about what was truly important.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:57.000
Until that day, when you taught me a valuable lesson.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:05.100
