WEBVTT

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.530
Huh? Where'd that guy go?

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.730
Ready?

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.600
Yeah.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.170
Then begin.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.000
Painful Decision

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.630
If only Lady Tsunade would come out of her coma,

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.230
I know she would resolve the situation with Sasuke.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.000
Sakura...

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.930
Excuse me.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.670
Sai?

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.170
I need to speak to you.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.300
Naruto did what?!

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.670
Yes.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.630
In order to protect Sasuke.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.330
He was bruised and battered all over.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.670
You bastard.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.400
Still, he refused to sell out Sasuke.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.170
Not only that...

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.430
In order to prevent you from worrying,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.530
he asked me to keep it quiet.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.270
Naruto...

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.330
He's on his way to see the Raikage

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.670
and ask him to forgive Sasuke.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.330
Why would he be so reckless?!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.470
Wasn't Kakashi with him?!

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.630
It probably wouldn't have made any difference.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.000
Kakashi Sensei has faith in Naruto.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.300
Even if it's a long shot,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.170
he probably wants to create an opportunity for him.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.400
If Lady Tsunade were there, she'd have done the same thing.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.670
Sakura...

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.870
I was only recently assigned to Team Kakashi to take Sasuke's place.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.400
So I still don't know all of you that well.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.930
And I'm not good at understanding a person's feelings.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.800
Also...

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.270
What?!

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.470
Did you tell her how you feel?

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.100
How could I?

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.300
I'm a guy who couldn't even keep my promise to her.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.570
I don't know the promise made between you and Naruto.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.470
Naruto...

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.900
This is a once in a lifetime request.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.570
Please...

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.370
Please bring Sasuke back.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.070
But...

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.270
Even I can tell that Naruto loves you!

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.070
You care for Sasuke so much.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.970
And I know what you're going through right now...

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.970
so much so that it hurts.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.200
I swear I'll bring Sasuke back!

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.070
I promise that on my life!

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.500
Sakura! I'll keep my promise to you.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.830
I swear I'll keep it because I said so.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.270
I said so...

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.930
I never go back on my word.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.270
That's my Ninja Way.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.970
Sakura...

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.170
It's as though Naruto has been shouldering

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.970
the burden of his promise to you.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.200
As though he intends to bear that burden for the rest of his life.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.500
I don't know what you told Naruto.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.230
But it's no different from what was done to me.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.970
It's like a Curse Mark.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.370
Sasuke is the source of Naruto's agony.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.300
But aren't you a part of it too?

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.570
Ino...

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.430
Don't cry, Ino!

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.530
Kiba, don't be so harsh.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.270
You know how Ino has felt about Sasuke all these...

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.800
It can't be helped!

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.270
Things have changed since then.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.530
Will they be okay?

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.530
Look at Ino.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.670
How will Naruto and Sakura take it?

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.100
Let's leave it to Shikamaru.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.230
He'll find the right words.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.370
Plus, there was that first mission of his as a squad leader that failed,

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.500
and he still feels somewhat responsible for it.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.400
If only we had been able to take Sasuke back that time.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.470
That's why he volunteered to be the persuader.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.530
Wait! Naruto genuinely wants to rescue Sasuke,

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.400
not just because he promised Sakura! Isn't that so?

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.300
I totally agree with you.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:02.070
But...both Sakura and I...

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.270
and everyone else rely on Naruto too much.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.600
I've watched how Naruto has been acting lately

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.570
and I figured out what he's feeling.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.230
It's sadness.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:21.500
Then my thoughts turn to Sasuke... and it starts to get warm inside my gut.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.370
I realize now that it's anger.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.000
Whether it's for Naruto's sake or for the village,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.570
we can't just rely on Naruto.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.930
We have to take action ourselves.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.430
Sasuke is... Sai is absolutely right.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.730
Shikamaru...

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.700
We're not kids anymore.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.070
We must stop the Akatsuki.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.630
And we must stop Sasuke.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:06.800
I came here for Team 7's consent.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.230
Consent? Don't tell me...

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.170
Yes...exactly that.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.600
We can't allow war to break out between the Hidden Leaf

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.030
and the Hidden Cloud because of Sasuke.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.200
Let me put it another way. Listen carefully.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.470
If the Hidden Cloud should kill Sasuke,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.870
there's no way Ino or you, or Naruto, would take it quietly.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.500
And if through some act of recklessness,

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.100
Ino and you are killed by the Cloud...

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.930
neither I, Choji, Inoichi nor your parents would sit still.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.070
They would seek revenge.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.130
Then the other side won't remain quiet.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.030
They'll want revenge.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.400
And if Choji and I are killed,

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.870
then it will be our parents who take action.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.500
And before we know it, we'll be at war.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.370
According to the messenger from the Cloud,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.270
Sasuke is already being treated as a criminal on a national level.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.730
If Sasuke continues to align himself with the Akatsuki

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.600
and intensify the hatred throughout the country,

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.870
the Hidden Leaf must deal with Sasuke.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.130
That is my belief.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.230
You understand where I'm coming from, don't you?

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.100
Sakura...

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.330
That's why I need your consent.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.900
Sakura, will you... Shikamaru!

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.100
Please don't...

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:47.900
say anything more.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.130
Sorry, Sakura... But whatever your answer is,

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.900
I must act for the sake of the Leaf's future.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.030
I intend to tell Naruto this too.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.470
Where is he?

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.870
Naruto has gone to the Land of Iron.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.200
To meet with the Raikage.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.770
He's willing to go that far?

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.100
I guess this isn't gonna be easy.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.100
I'll talk to Naruto.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.570
Sakura!

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.130
He's foolish enough to like someone like me.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.430
So let me handle this.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.270
I'm the one who made Naruto suffer the most.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.370
I'm always messing up.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.330
One failure after another.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.530
I don't want to make any more mistakes.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.870
I don't want to fail.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.430
That's why...

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.200
Let the Hokage lead the Allied Shinobi Forces?!

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.930
If you all approve, I will accept this appointment.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.430
Why the Hokage?!

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.230
He is synonymous with the dark side of ninja!

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.800
We cannot let him take charge!

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.600
Then whom would you suggest?

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.000
Not one of the Akatsuki came from my village!

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.900
This important post requires trust! I should be the one to...

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.870
I cannot agree to that.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.400
What?!

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:27.730
I am well aware that passion and strength are essential

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.830
in bringing the strong together.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.400
But someone like you,

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.870
who lets his emotions rule his use of power,

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.430
would send the Allied Forces into disarray like the top of that desk.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.900
I am simply making an objective, rational observation

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.970
as a representative of a neutral nation.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.700
Lord Kazekage is much too young to wield such power.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.100
He does not yet have much pull with nations.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.300
His title of Kazekage alone is inadequate.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.030
Lord Tsuchikage, on the other hand, is too advanced in years

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.300
and gives the impression of one whose power has waned.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.770
And, he used the Akatsuki too much.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.230
He is lacking in trust the most.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:16.200
Lady Mizukage's Hidden Mist is said to be the birthplace of the Akatsuki.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.330
There is the fear that inside information will be leaked to them.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.300
That there are spies.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.070
We do not know why the Akatsuki is gathering the Tailed Beasts

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.000
or what they intend to do with them.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.500
But we cannot let them have the Nine-Tails.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.400
The Nine-Tails belongs to the Hidden Leaf.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.930
Hence, I believe that the Hokage is the logical choice.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.200
First of all, I refuse to recognize an Allied Shinobi Force

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.100
that would compromise the security of my village!

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.670
Something about this just doesn't feel right.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.070
I'd better check.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.030
Chojuro...

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.630
Be prepared for battle.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:58.770
Huh?

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.130
Byakugan!

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.200
Th-This is...

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.700
What's the meaning of this?

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.200
That right shoulder and right arm...

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.400
and the color of the right eye...

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.400
There's no mistake.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.370
It's the color of Shisui Uchiha's eye!

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.300
He was a formidable foe that I fought against once.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.270
I'll never forget his color!

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:44.700
Lord Hokage!

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.070
I ask that you show us your right eye underneath that bandage.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.830
What's going on?

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.500
I believe you stole Shisui Uchiha's eye

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.930
and then transplanted it into your right eye, did you not?

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.830
Shisui...Uchiha?

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.670
The man praised alongside Itachi Uchiha

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.270
as the Uchiha's most gifted in the use of the Ocular Jutsu?

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.700
Yes.

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.370
Shisui's particular Ocular Jutsu allowed him to enter others' minds,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:20.970
make them go through phantom experiences and manipulate them.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.870
The victim would be totally unaware that he was being manipulated.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.400
It was an Ocular Jutsu of the highest degree!

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.870
Hokage! Don't tell me Mifune is being...

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.500
But...that's...

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.070
My right eye is also a precious spoil of war,

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.870
from a battle against the Hyuga.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.430
So like you, I am not really one to talk.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.330
But you cannot fool my eye,

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.930
which undid the genjutsu cast upon the Fourth Mizukage!

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.700
And...

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.800
Why you!

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.430
Hello!

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.570
One problem after another! Now what?!

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.630
Is it the Akatsuki?!

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.100
It seems so.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.800
Sasuke Uchiha has snuck in!

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:33.170
Now, where could he be hiding?!

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.430
What?!

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.130
Sasuke?

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.100
- Him? - What's he doing here?!

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.700
The one with the Sharingan?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.830
The one who took down Haku and Zabuza?

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.000
Who's he?

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.230
A member of the Akatsuki.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.600
I believe his name was...

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:58.400
Let's all go and look for Sasuke!

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.030
Yeah!

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.330
Where is Sasuke Uchiha?!

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.200
Answer me!

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.630
Th-This guy is super fast!

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.970
If you refuse to answer, I will show you no mercy!

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.600
Sasuke...

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.600
Where are you now? And what are you thinking?

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:47.370
Do you think about me, Sakura, or Kakashi Sensei...even a little?

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.830
You brought down your brother Itachi.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:59.470
You got your revenge.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.270
Are you relieved?

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.570
Or are you in more pain?

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:21.270
Sasuke... Why won't you come home to the Leaf Village?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.770
Has hatred consumed you completely, Sasuke?

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:37.030
Have you really turned into a mere criminal?

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:51.070
Now I'm starting to lose sight of who you are.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.530
Hey...

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.630
How about we talk, Naruto Uzumaki?

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.230
This is bad.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.470
What is it, Karin?

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.830
The Samurai's movements have suddenly become flurried.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.670
I think they're looking for us!

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.600
What?! But we didn't do anything to be spotted.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.800
Must be the doing of that guy Zetsu, who disappeared.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.800
That bastard... I'll get him for this.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.300
There's too many of them! They'll find us in no time.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.420
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Racing Lightning"

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.980
I'm very irritated right now.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.600
Tune in again!
