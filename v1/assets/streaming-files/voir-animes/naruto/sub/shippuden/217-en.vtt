WEBVTT

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.600
Orochimaru's Return

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.180
This is Kabuto?

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.390
He's kind of gross, huh?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.270
This one coming out of his gut looks like a huge—

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.270
Just leave him be.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.230
She's alive.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.100
What do you want with me at this point?

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.640
Why'd you go out of your way to look for me?

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.770
Oh yeah! That's right. See…

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.350
We found something incredible in one of the hideouts.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.100
Now let's see…

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.680
Earlier, you said that you and Itachi stopped the Reanimation, right?

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.520
But I don't think it worked on the reanimated Madara.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.020
No matter what darkness or contradictions lie within the village,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.020
I am still Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf!

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.930
You're the only person I can count on, my best friend.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.140
Please protect this village… and the honor of the Uchiha name.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.600
I told you, there's something I must do.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.730
I see.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.140
So it hasn't been stopped.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.390
I'm talking to Sasuke! Don't interrupt me.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.890
Anyway, never mind that.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.100
Look!

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.430
Look, look!

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.390
See! Amazing, right?!

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.480
With this, we Taka can rule the shinobi world!

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.640
This is it…

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.100
The human who's all-knowing…

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.310
I have to meet up with someone.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.310
I'm leaving.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.180
Huh? Who?

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.100
Orochimaru.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.350
Huh?!

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.060
What are you talking about?

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.680
You killed Orochimaru!

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.100
I thought you would use this to…

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.180
Are you really surprised someone as tenacious as Orochimaru

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.100
might not be killed so easily?

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.140
And even if I do find him vile…

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.480
I need him to do something for me.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.020
The clan…

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.980
The village…

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.850
It's time to see the all-knowing.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.310
What do you mean, “see” Orochimaru?

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.060
Who is this all-knowing person?

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.520
You don't need to know.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.100
What? I don't get it.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.980
In any case, Orochimaru must never be resurrected!

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.770
You probably want to ask Orochimaru for help

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.310
in using the power of the scroll, right?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.850
Just give it time and you'll figure it out.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.980
That's why we looked for you and…

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.850
There are still things only Orochimaru can do.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.430
Sasuke, tell me…

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.850
You were Orochimaru's favorite pupil, right?

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.270
So why can't you…?

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.310
Suigetsu!

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.520
Listen.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.730
Huh? What?

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.270
Don't underestimate Orochimaru.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.520
Idiot!

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.430
I don't underestimate him!

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.390
It's the exact opposite!

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.810
You were able to bring down Orochimaru

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.480
only because both his arms

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.230
were useless from the Reaper Death Seal, that's all.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.640
You're the one who's underestimating him!

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.350
Even if he is revived, his arms will probably still be useless.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.270
But he'll still be dangerous.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.060
He's going to come after your body again!

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.890
If he finds out about this war, he's going to want to be a part of it.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.270
He wants to destroy the Leaf too!

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.270
And that means that Team Taka will get mixed up in this war!

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.180
Are you okay with that?

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.100
We succeeded in beating our superiors.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.430
It's our time now!

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.770
Who'd want to see Orochimaru now?

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.770
Hasn't he caused us enough trouble?

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.350
Shut up, Suigetsu.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.600
Cut out and bring me a piece of Kabuto's flesh.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.730
Huh?

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.100
You don't listen to me, but you expect me to listen to you?

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.930
I'll do it.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.390
It's always like this…

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.480
Jugo, are you okay with this?

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.230
Orochimaru's going to be resurrected, you know…

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.680
I don't care.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.270
Sasuke's will is Kimimaro's will.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.310
I will abide by it.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.100
You're just the same.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.230
What is going on with all of this?

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.640
In my village, we call it Sage Transformation.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.020
My transformation originally was the same thing.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.930
But in all of my clones, it's called the Curse Mark Transformation.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.980
I'm going to seal your Curse Mark.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.680
Curse Sealing!

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.600
So the reverse of it is: Curse Unsealing!

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.850
Who could have imagined…

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.810
that it would be you who would facilitate my return!

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.180
H-Hello there! Long time no see.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.270
Orochimaru, there's something I want you to do for me.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.980
Don't bother explaining.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.640
I've been watching from inside Anko this whole time.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.890
I secured My Sage Jutsu Chakra into those Curse Marks.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.390
They are like pieces of my consciousness.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.310
Then you know about the war too?

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.850
Of course.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.180
I just have one thing to say about that, Suigetsu.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.730
Huh?

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.230
I have absolutely no interest in this war.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.480
Huh?!

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.560
It's someone else's war.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.100
The only thing I'm interested in right now…

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.060
Sasuke… is your young body!

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.100
I told you!

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.180
Having said that, I don't currently have the power to steal it.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.640
I wouldn't be so sure…

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.270
What is your intent in meeting with them?

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.180
There's too much that I don't know.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.810
So I plan to ask them everything.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.810
Everything?

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.560
There's no need to know it all.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.890
You're still a child.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.310
You're wrong.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.100
I treated you like a child…

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.180
I only tried to protect you. I didn't trust your strength.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.520
But now, I believe…

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.480
that perhaps you could have changed Father, Mother,

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.930
and the rest of the Uchiha.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.100
If I had been open with you from the start…

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.890
and looked you straight in the eyes and told you the truth.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.270
I'm not a child anymore.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.270
I can't stay a child.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.270
And no matter what you do from here on out…

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.770
I want to know what started it all.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.230
What I'm supposed to be, what I'm supposed to do.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.060
Are you questioning your vengeance?

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:42.100
No… Not my quest for vengeance itself.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.890
Reuniting with Itachi made my hatred

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.730
towards the Hidden Leaf grow even stronger.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.680
It's just…

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.060
I want to understand how even in death,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.890
Itachi could still consider himself a Leaf Shinobi,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.730
and care about and try to protect the village

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.560
that dishonored his name.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.600
Who was Itachi? What is a clan? What is a village?

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.180
And so…

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.680
I want to know everything, so I can finally have the answer.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.770
I need to see with my own eyes and

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.390
decide with my own mind what I must do.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:23.350
He's no longer the Sasuke who was manipulated by Itachi…

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.100
or me…or Tobi.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.640
What a strange sensation.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.980
He's going to absorb all of Kabuto's power, and then kill him!

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.560
You better stay alert.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.390
He might try and catch you off guard too!

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.930
The current you…isn't half bad.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.310
Didn't I tell you? He did absorb his power!

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.100
No, you're wrong.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.350
He undid the Sage Transformation.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.100
He's taken back his own chakra that was inside Kabuto.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.770
He didn't touch Kabuto's chakra.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.020
Fine, I'll help you.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.310
Come along.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.930
Where are we going?

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.980
Someplace you're very familiar with.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.560
Let's be on our way.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.060
The statue's been acting weird since it swallowed something earlier.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.390
That was…

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.730
Don't tell me…

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.230
I would have preferred resurrecting it

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.310
in a completed state but…

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.270
Watch closely and feel it through your skin…

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.430
The return of Ten Tails!

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.730
And the beginning of the end!

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.350
So that's it!

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.850
That statue was the Ten Tails' actual body!

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.640
Huh?! What's Ten Tails?!

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.980
But what's going on?

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.020
When he declared war at the Five Kage Summit…

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.020
The purpose of this war was to collect

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.100
all nine Tailed Beasts' chakra in order to revive Ten Tails.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.770
He doesn't possess Eight Tails or Nine Tails yet…

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.480
Is he bluffing?

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.140
It's too risky to get up close.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.560
Oh…

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.890
Only a fragment, but it is not lacking in power.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.680
Have we given him one tentacle arm's worth of chakra?

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.100
We're always dropping rhymes

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.270
But maybe we messed up big time…

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640
Yay!

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.430
The chakra from a tentacle was taken, just a little

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.310
I may not look it I admit I'm flustered a bit

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.520
He took the chakra from one of Eight Tails' tentacle arms…

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.890
Does that mean only a portion of a Tailed Beast is sufficient?

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.600
Naruto…

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.180
You felt it too, didn't you?

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.810
That was my chakra in that bottle and gourd.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:43.680
Yup…

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.560
Let me take over, Naruto.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.020
I'll explain.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.850
About Ten Tails too. You listen from in here.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.560
You know about Ten Tails, Kurama?

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.140
Yeah, of course.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.270
Listen up, everyone!

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.270
Hmm?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.600
That voice!

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.600
Naruto switched places with Nine Tails, pow!

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.140
He'll explain everything to us…

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.230
Nine Tails and Naruto are tight now!

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.930
If even just a portion of the Tailed Beast is sufficient…

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.310
Then that statue already has a piece

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.140
of Eight Tails' and my chakra inside it.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.270
The Nine Tails too?!

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.180
The bottle and gourd that guy summoned and fed

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.430
to the statue just now

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.270
were two of Old Man Six Paths' treasured tools.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.520
They both possess powerful Sealing Jutsu

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.180
that can seal away anything and everything.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.850
Once you get put inside either one of them,

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.180
you can't get out, no matter what.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:45.850
So…

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.850
Sealed inside the bottle was a guy named Kinkaku.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.890
And Ginkaku was sealed inside the gourd.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.520
I suspect they were reanimated using the Reanimation Jutsu,

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.180
used in the war and then sealed away.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.430
Kinkaku and Ginkaku, and the Sage of the Six Paths…

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.930
They're all legendary names…

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.730
But what's the connection with Nine Tails' chakra?

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.980
There was a time when the brothers challenged me to a battle.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.270
Naturally, I devoured them.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:26.850
However… They survived and fed on me from the inside

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.020
and absorbed my chakra.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.640
So Kinkaku and Ginkaku had some of your chakra.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.100
And the masked guy took them as insurance,

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.890
for the revival of the Ten Tails…

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.180
from Darui's First Company.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.100
That's consistent with the report we got from HQ.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.230
But given that they're just fragments of Eight Tails' and my chakra,

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.930
who knows what form or shape the revived Ten Tails will take.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.140
We must act before Ten Tails fully comes back to life.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.270
Kakashi…

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:07.430
You speak your mind way too easily.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.810
You're a man for whom a life full of regrets is fitting!

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.390
Just…who the hell are you anyway?

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.180
What's the point in telling someone who can't remember faces?

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.890
Kakashi, like you said, if we're going to make a move,

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.480
now's the chance, before the Ten Tails is revived fully.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.350
Old Man Six Paths used to say that Ten Tails' full revival

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.140
would signify the end of the world.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.100
Is the Ten Tails really that terrible?

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:47.180
I get that he's got Ten Tails, but just how powerful is he?

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.770
He's the aggregate of the chakra of all the Tailed Beasts,

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.520
One Tail through me.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.520
He was the beginning of chakra and a creator-god of many nations.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:04.730
Amenohitotsunokami… Datara… Deidarabotchi…

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.480
He has many names.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.180
He drank oceans, split open the earth,

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.560
and hoisted up mountains…

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.930
He is the progenitor who is said to have created this very land.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:20.850
Simply put, he has the total power of all nine Tailed Beasts.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.930
Honestly, I couldn't take him on by myself and hope to win.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.680
But if he only has a piece of Eight Tails and me,

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.230
who has the most chakra out of the nine…

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.270
it might be worth a try.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.230
You're all mistaken.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.480
For me, the revival of Ten Tails doesn't need to be complete.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.930
My end goal is a Super Genjutsu…

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.730
The Infinite Tsukuyomi!

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.350
I will put every human on this planet under a single genjutsu…

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.980
A single world that belongs to nobody.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:09.140
One perfect world without war or ill feelings.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.770
Only within a single collective consciousness…

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.100
where the individual has been cast aside, can truth be found!

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:23.020
The world no longer needs hope, a future or famous heroes.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.390
Even if incomplete, once Ten Tails is revived,

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.730
the Infinite Tsukuyomi Jutsu can be achieved.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.480
Then reality will come to an end…

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:36.100
And all that will exist will be a single unending dream…

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.230
that will last for all eternity!

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.180
Kurama, switch back!

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:51.850
I had Dad, Mom, and Pervy Sage.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.350
Kids love looking up to their hero.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.600
That's why I can keep running forward without hesitation.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.890
I will become the greatest Hokage of them all!

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.140
That's my dream, you idiot!

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.020
Even if you don't want your youth to end,

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.180
dreams must come to an end at some point!

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.310
Yeah… Dreams must be fulfilled.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.520
Dreams, dreams, lots o' dreams abound

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.520
I dream of grown women's boobs… So round!

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.930
When dreams are fulfilled, that's where truth is found!

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.680
You've got guts, Bee…

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.020
Telling us about your preferences at a time like this…

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.310
Individuality makes you lose sight of the truth.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.480
My words as a nobody…

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.310
are words guided by the truth of the world.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.270
Your window of opportunity is the instant he tries to suck you inside himself.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.020
That's when he'll be solid.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.730
If you try to attack him normally, you'll just pass right through him.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:46.850
Go for a counterattack!

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.020
Create an opening through continuous close combat!

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.430
Avoid using big moves!

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.930
I know! That's why I created a clone!

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:59.680
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Secret of the Transportation Technique"

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.930
Naruto! Just keep going!

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.980
THE SECRET OF THE TRANSPORTATION TECHNIQUE
