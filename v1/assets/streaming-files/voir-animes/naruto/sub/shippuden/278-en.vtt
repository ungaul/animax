WEBVTT

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.580
I've got dreams too!

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.960
I'm gonna become an even greater Hokage than you, Dad!

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.580
I swear I will!

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.130
So when you see Mom over there, please tell her…

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.170
that she doesn't have to worry about me at all!

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.580
Tell her I'm doin' my best!

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.350
THE FINAL VALLEY

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.640
We're leaving the rest to you… Kakashi, Sakura…

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.680
Sasuke and Naruto.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.060
Lord Third!

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.560
Elder Brother, you finally settled things with Madara.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.810
As Saru said…

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.560
let's leave the rest to the next generation.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.100
Naruto Uzumaki…

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.230
Sasuke Uchiha…

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.230
You two will probably find a different conclusion than we did.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.980
No…make sure you do.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.020
Now, we're free too!

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.100
I'm going back to Suirendo!

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.730
I'm going to seclude myself in a forest.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.310
We can finally go back to our homes.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.600
It's like a dream.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.270
Eight Tails, what are you gonna do?

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.850
Me? Well…

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.890
I think I'm gonna go back to Bee.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.270
Even his annoying rap has ended up growing on me.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.810
So, what about you?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.640
What will you do?

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.680
I'll…

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.980
A little piece of each of your chakra…

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.810
is already within Naruto.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.640
In short, Naruto is like a gathering place for you.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.810
If you want to discuss something,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.180
you can speak to each other through your chakra inside Naruto.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.890
Kurama… Hmm?

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.270
I'd like you to stay inside Naruto as the overseer of the gathering place.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.600
It's no longer a hardship for you anymore, is it?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.770
Well, if you say so, old man, I guess have no choice.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.930
What?! What's so funny?

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.480
Still not upfront with your feelings… You haven't changed at all, Kurama.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.140
So the Great Ninja War is finally over now.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.680
Yes. All that's left is…

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.100
Naruto and Sasuke… I asked you before.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.600
After battling my mother Kaguya,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.810
is there any change to the answers you gave me?

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.640
My answer's the same.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.850
And I'm sorry, Super Gramps,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.140
but there is one thing I feel strongly about after fighting Kaguya…

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.640
I'm really glad that Kushina Uzumaki was my mom.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.600
Kaguya was different from anyone I've ever battled.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.520
It's like she didn't have a heart at all.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.140
It's said my mother Kaguya started off as a beloved goddess of the people.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.640
I do not know for sure what caused her to transform

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.100
into a being that came to be called a demon.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.640
I suspect something was triggered

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.980
the moment she devoured the Chakra Fruit.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.180
In any case, you are not like my mother.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.770
I trust you not to become like her,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.560
even with all of the Tailed Beast Chakra within you.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.180
Now then, all that's left is…

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.640
to undo the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.680
But how, specifically? Do you need our powers?

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.640
No, you're fine.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.600
Naruto has the chakra of every Tailed Beast.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.850
And Sasuke possesses the Rinnegan.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.930
If they both weave the sign for rat simultaneously,

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.140
the jutsu will be undone.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.730
What? That's it? It's so simple.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.100
I researched thoroughly how to undo Mother's Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.020
There's no mistake.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.810
Now then, the rest is up to you, Sasuke.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.730
Yes…

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.560
But first, I'm executing the current Five Kage inside the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.430
What did you just say, Sasuke?

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.890
What about the Five Kage?

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.850
Oh, and…

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.020
I'm putting all of you Tailed Beasts under my control…

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.020
and eventually, I'll get rid of you as well.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.100
What did you say?!

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:47.810
Kurama!

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.430
He put the Tailed Beasts in a genjutsu…

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.850
and with a single glance too.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.600
Naruto, it has ended up as I expected.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.770
I have no choice but to leave the rest to you.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.810
I cannot stay in this world any longer.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.890
I shall soon fade away.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.680
Yeah, and sorry for saying this, Six Paths Super Gramps…

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.810
but we won't end up like your sons.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.480
I'm not Ashura.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.640
And Sasuke isn't Indra either.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.680
Sasuke! Is this what your current dream is?

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.730
Are you saying you're still seeking vengeance?

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.390
Sasuke!

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.680
I admit, at one time, all I wished for was destruction,

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.730
and vengeance was my goal.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.810
But I feel differently now.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.730
I want to destroy, and rebuild.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.640
A village no longer shrouded in darkness.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.020
I'll reform the shinobi world.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.930
What I'm touting is…

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.770
…revolution!

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.980
Revolution?!

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.310
My dear Sasuke, what do you want to do?

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.810
What is it that you seek in the aftermath of this war?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.730
I want to hear your honest thoughts and opinions.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.730
All of the previous Kage created these current circumstances.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.980
So I will become Hokage and change the village.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.020
This Hokage you speak of… What do you mean by it?

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.520
If want to know so badly, I'll tell you.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.730
Catastrophic Planetary Devastation!

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.680
Naruto… It's on you!

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.640
I swear I'll get you all out!

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.140
Just hang in there a little while longer!

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.770
Because of this war,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.730
I've become quite adept at using my Rinnegan's abilities.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.770
And all those who were in my way are gone.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.640
Except for you… Naruto.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.730
Things just don't go as planned.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.350
When I bequeathed power to just one side,

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.600
I ended up with Indra and Ashura.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:55.350
This time, even after entrusting power to both, the result is the same.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.350
Nope… All sibling squabbling ends right here!

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:25.100
Let the Tailed Beasts go. They've finally gained freedom.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.100
I'm friends with them, so I know.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.730
They won't cause trouble anymore.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.560
Naruto, you don't seem to get it.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.640
You're now the Jinchuriki of all the Tailed Beasts.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.640
Which means I plan to eventually get rid of

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.060
the Tailed Beast Chakra inside of you too.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.140
What?!

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.430
In other words, you're going to die, Naruto.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.640
Out of necessity.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.640
If what the Sage said was true, there's no need to use

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.600
the Tailed Beast power inside you to release the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.020
I can take advantage of the Tailed Beasts that I captured.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.100
I'll let them live until then.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.810
You know that I won't let you do that, right?

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.640
I guess I'll have to deal with you first, Naruto.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.600
Let's move this elsewhere. You know, don't you?

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.310
Wait, Sasuke!

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.850
Sensei!

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.680
The lingering aftereffects of the Sharingan…

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:31.350
I… I know in my heart that there's nothing I can do!

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.430
Even though I love you.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.980
Even though I care about you so much, Sasuke. And yet…

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.600
I can't get close to you or exchange blows with you.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.680
I can only whine and beg and cry like this again.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.810
It's so pitiful, isn't it?

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.810
Sakura…

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.730
Thank you.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.480
But…But Sasuke!

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.520
If there's even a little corner of your heart that thinks about me,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.680
please don't leave again!

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.140
If we stick together, I know it can be like old times again…

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.350
You're…

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.890
…really annoying.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.770
Sakura!

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.600
You didn't need to put Sakura under genjutsu!

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.140
If I didn't,

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.770
she would've chased after us, and gotten in the way.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.390
Sakura…Sakura just wanted to help you, all this time.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.890
So you're suggesting I enjoy a little romance?

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:58.480
Well, I have no reason to love her or be loved by her.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.600
The only time you need a reason is when you hate someone!

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.810
And Sakura's not trying to make you hers!

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.390
She just wants to help you!

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.390
She almost died by your hand.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.140
But she still thinks of your welfare and sheds tears for you…

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.640
because she suffers from loving you!

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.640
Mom…

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.560
How does Dad really feel about Big Brother and me?

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.230
What makes you ask that out of the blue?

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:39.680
The other day, he said to me, "That's my boy."

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:44.930
He usually says that to Big Brother, so I was really happy.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.770
Is that so? That's nice.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.560
But recently, Dad and Big Brother haven't been getting along, so…

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.350
I thought maybe I'm just a stand-in for Big Brother…

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.930
Your brother is your brother, and you are you.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:14.020
Your father is always thinking about the both of you.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.390
Then why is it always about Big Brother?!

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.770
That's not the case.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.680
Your father represents our clan,

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.180
and he's expected to protect the Uchiha Clan.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.680
So what?

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.390
It's just that Itachi is older than you, and your senior.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.680
So he's given more duties relating to the clan.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.100
Since your father oversees those duties,

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.310
it's only natural that his eyes will be more focused on Itachi.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.060
But this is just between us…

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.930
When your father is with me, all he talks about is you.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.350
He's always so serious,

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.020
and just not very good at expressing his feelings.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.100
Here's your lunch, Sasuke.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.810
When you come home, I'll watch over your shuriken practice.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.600
It's not practice. It's training.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.980
I'm leaving!

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.730
Have a great day.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.810
Perhaps, those are the ties to a failed past.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.600
Sasuke!

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.100
I made a promise.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.770
Long ago…to Sakura.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.100
I'll definitely bring Sasuke back!

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.810
I swear on my life!

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.600
Sensei! You know about my Ninja Way, right?

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.310
I'm gonna go.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.100
Yeah… We're counting on you.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.770
Love is a difficult thing…

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.810
I once had two sons.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.850
I loved them both, and they loved and revered me.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.180
But I entrusted everything to the younger brother.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.600
That became the impetus

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.890
for the older brother to begin hating his brother and me.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.600
Love transformed into hate.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.640
What molded the current Sasuke,

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.560
is none other than his loss of love in the past.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.810
Madara was the same too.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:47.100
Are you saying that Sasuke shares the same fate as Madara?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.520
No, not at all.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.810
I, too, want to make the future better in my own way.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:00.730
Having learned from past mistakes, this time I gave both of them the power.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.980
The past does not exist

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.060
to remind the present that the future cannot change.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.230
The past is supposed to exist for the sake of the future.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.640
How did you see the potential within Naruto?

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.270
Naruto Uzumaki…

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.730
The boy was able to save and befriend Kurama,

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.230
who had become a concretion of hatred.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.850
I shall let Naruto handle this.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.850
Since I hope that hate can be transformed into love this time.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:35.680
Or rather, I have hope that love can be regained.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:45.180
Because, unlike my mother, Naruto as well as Sasuke…

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.770
know what love is.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.770
This place, huh? I should've figured.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.100
Doesn't it bring back memories, Sasuke?

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.600
Long ago, we fought here.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.680
And just like before, you're going to lose.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.100
You won't be hitting me with that same punch as last time!

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.680
I'm not about to let you get away with whatever you want.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.680
I won't let you become the Hokage, either!

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.600
You don't even understand what it means to be Hokage!

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.140
I told you, that to me, being Hokage means revolution.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.230
It's totally different from what you think.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:31.140
Let me tell you something your big brother said…

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.810
It's not the one who becomes Hokage

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.600
who gets acknowledged by all.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.600
But it's the one acknowledged by all who becomes Hokage.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:45.430
I learned not from Itachi's words, but from the way he lived his life.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.480
You and I came up with different answers.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.520
Let me clarify this before we battle…

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.600
I'll teach you exactly what being Hokage means to me.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.380
You don't understand the way Itachi lived his life at all!

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.460
Itachi is now in my past.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.670
I will cut off everything in my past right here…

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.250
Starting with cutting you down.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.090
Yours will be the last blood I shed…

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.170
in the memory of my late older brother.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.420
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Final Battle"

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.210
I won't let you!

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:28.550
THE FINAL BATTLE Tune in again!
