WEBVTT

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.040
An Opening

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.000
I'll have to teleport it away with me!

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.670
You can have this back.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.210
Don't worry.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.960
I only teleported a clone.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.750
I marked him that last time we were in contact.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.080
Amazing! You can copy my dad's move!

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.250
Impressive, Second Great Stone Face-guy!

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.630
Lord Fourth is using my move!

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.500
And just call me "Lord Second"!

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.830
Wood Style: Wood Dragon!

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.960
Get out of my way, Madara!

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.710
I don't have much time,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.580
but there's something I've got to do now!

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.080
Wood Style: Wood Golem Jutsu!

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.790
I'm taking another chunk of you!

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.170
A-Amazing!

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.920
They're on a completely different level!

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.830
So this is the battle capacity of our predecessors!

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.130
If we went out there...

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.630
we would just get in their way for sure.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.040
We're of no use in a battle like that.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.000
Ino, please!

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.250
Got it.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.040
Even a small power... can be helpful.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.210
It's Shikamaru...

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.790
We may not be any help now,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.540
but there might come a time when we'll be needed.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.250
So don't take your eyes off the battlefield.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.080
For if such a time arrives...

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.210
our power could change the course of this world!

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.170
We can't afford to relax and let our guard down,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.880
even for one second!

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.750
That's right.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.750
He's got a point...

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.960
– Yeah... – Yeah!

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.830
Shikamaru, you would make a great Hokage.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.920
The ability to sway people's hearts is practically a requisite of any Kage.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.540
This is just like that time...

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.460
Madara, we were friends!

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.380
And we shared the same dream!

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.920
Hashirama!

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.960
How long will you keep saying such juvenile things?

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.500
It's just not possible to show our guts to each other!

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.960
Hashirama!

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.960
Madara!

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.790
The end result will be different, though...

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.210
So when are we supposed to make our move, Shikamaru?

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.130
You should try to think for yourself a little.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.960
But first, we need to figure out the circumstances of their battle.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.750
Also...

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.500
What's going on over there?

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.330
Did he get him?

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.830
He blocked it, huh? He's fast.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.920
We won't be able to hit him with ordinary jutsu.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.130
I guess I'll have to make an opening

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.500
with my Rasen-Flash Super-Circle Dance Howl Stage Three...

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.880
You're a bit of a comedian, aren't you?

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.210
I'd normally make fun of your jutsu names...

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.000
Except this guy we're facing is absolutely no joke.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.920
Amaterasu!

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.960
Sasuke! Naruto! I said I would create an opening for you!

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.750
I'll do it!

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.580
No, we will!

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.630
We'll let Dad and the others be the main act!

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.330
I could tell you were amassing chakra in your left eye.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.330
Hardly a surprise attack.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.330
Jeez!

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.460
Let's go, Fourth.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.920
A clone's Flying Raijin is much slower.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.920
Let's combine and reciprocate our Flying Raijin.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.500
Go ahead and put your mark on me.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.920
Yes, sir.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.960
Plus with these bodies, we can still move after being hit!

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.000
Naruto, this time, I'll match your chakra level using my Sharingan.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.790
No need to turn it into a competition!

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.750
– Wind Style: Rasen Shuriken! – Inferno Style: Flame Control!

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.170
A pincer attack?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.500
You two are the main act!

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.130
Distracted by what's going on in front of you?

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.750
Now!

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.830
– Reciprocal Round-Robin Jutsu! – Reciprocal Round-Robin Jutsu!

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.250
– Flying Raijin Jutsu! – Flying Raijin Jutsu!

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.670
I name it the Scorch Style Nimbus Tempest!

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.580
Just keep on going as planned!

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.420
So they switched places with the Flying Raijin?!

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.960
Hinata! What's going on with Naruto and Sasuke?

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.540
They're both...

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.830
smiling...

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.360
Smiling?

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.610
Both of them?

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.610
Yeah.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.860
All right!

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.190
Did they get him?!

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.570
I got in a direct hit before those black things could protect him.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.940
He should have felt that one.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.150
No effect at all.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.280
We can't touch those black, transforming spheres...

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.530
Our attacks have no effect on him...

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.780
He's quick on both offense and defense...

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.730
What a pain.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.480
He's even more perfect than how I imagine myself in my dreams!

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.570
It's like he's truly obtained dreamlike power.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.820
That's odd.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:27.820
What is?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.030
Your arm was ripped off...

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.190
There should be dust swirling around to restore it by now.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.190
Our reanimated bodies aren't regenerating...

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:53.650
I have come to possess the same power as the Founder of Shinobi.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.780
You can no longer measure me by the standards you are used to.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.190
Don't tell me, your jutsu...!

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.730
What does he mean by the same power as the Founder of Shinobi?

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.860
Fourth...

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:16.650
Try not to get seriously injured again, even with our reanimated bodies...

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.780
He's probably using a jutsu based

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.780
on Shadow and Light Styles that nullify all ninjutsu.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.860
In other words, if he destroys our reanimated bodies...

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.780
we'll be unable to regenerate, and we'll die!

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:37.030
Also...assume that right arm of yours is permanently gone.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.820
If that's the case, we'll need to fight him even more carefully...

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.650
But since ninjutsu won't work on him, this will be tricky.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.860
How about physical attacks?

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:50.730
Let's try it out.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.690
Sasuke... What?

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.570
We're going to have to take the lead.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.150
Think you can keep up?

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.820
Don't underestimate the Uchiha.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.070
All right!

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.650
I'll up my Kurama Mode and go into Tailed Beast State!

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.030
Huh?

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.030
Don't make things worse than they already are...

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.400
You're as goofy as your father.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.860
So much that even he's dumbfounded...

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.150
S-Sorry.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.070
Kurama! Lend me a little more chakra!

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.150
Hold off on going into Nine Tails State for just a bit!

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.980
But he's not someone we can beat without it.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.480
If you want to enter into Perfect Tailed Beast State,

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.980
you're going to have to fight in normal mode for a bit.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.820
Syrup Gun!

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.690
A toad from Mount Myoboku?

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.480
What was that about Gamakichi?

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.150
If you're going make a move, do something diversionary or a combo...

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.480
Sorry, but we're approaching the time limit for the summoning.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.230
I just wanted to repay him with a parting shot!

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.400
Thanks for the effort! Go get some rest!

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.280
Sorry about this.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:34.570
This is...

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.360
Obito, I thought you wanted to become Hokage.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:39.820
Why are you doing this?

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.440
You want to know why?

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:43.860
This is my chance!

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.070
Lecturing me now?

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.650
Isn't it a bit late for that...Sensei?

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.730
You're always too late when it matters most.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.820
Anyway, Rin and Kakashi are surrounded by dozens of shinobi!

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:06.690
And it looks like they're all powerful jonin and ANBU...

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.650
What is Minato Sensei doing?

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.650
Who's that?

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.400
I'm asking you what the Yellow Flash is doing!

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.320
Hmm... He seems to be on a different mission.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.440
At a time like this?

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.900
Rin... I want to...

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.320
I want to create a world with you in it...

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.780
I'm glad my teacher was a Hokage.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.730
It made it easy to give up on becoming Hokage.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.900
He got past Lord Third's personal ANBU Black Ops,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.650
infiltrated a top-secret barrier,

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.360
and knew that the seal

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.780
on the Nine Tails would be at its weakest during childbirth...

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.570
Are you Madara Uchiha?

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.690
No... That's impossible... He's dead.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.730
Who knows? Am I?

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.820
Right now, I don't care who you are...

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.940
But why are you targeting the Leaf?

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.780
You could say it's on a whim, but also as part of a plan,

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.780
for the sake of war, but also for the sake of peace.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.190
If I had realized that man was Obito,

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.190
I probably could have stopped him...

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.900
And then, I might have been able to prevent Kushina from dying.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.900
I might not have had to make Naruto

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.070
into Nine Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.820
If only...

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.070
I had realized he was Obito...

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.820
Perhaps the shinobi world wouldn't have ended up like this either!

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.650
Even though you were my teacher, you didn't realize it was me.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.690
That's just who you are fundamentally.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.440
How pathetic... You died a heroic Hokage,

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.320
but now you're being exposed as a disgrace in front of your son.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.030
That's right...

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.820
A Hokage is a pitiable existence... compared to what I am now.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.780
Apparently the kid's not a goofball.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.480
He's caught on!

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.780
You have no right to make fun of a Hokage

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.030
when you couldn't even become one yourself.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.480
Naruto, you—!

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.730
Especially my dad... who actually became Hokage.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.480
How dare you put him down!

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.980
That worked?! Why? How?

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.900
It's effective! I knew it!

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.230
Even if ninjutsu is ineffective, Sage Jutsu still works!

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.730
The toad from Mount Myoboku used Sage Jutsu

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.820
and his attack wasn't nullified.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.940
You bastard!

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.480
That's amazing, Naruto...

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.150
What's going on?

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.610
His Sage Jutsu is working!

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.860
He's even mastered the same Sage Jutsu as Jiraiya Sensei...

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.860
He's grown into quite a son, eh, Minato?

00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:00.110
It's no wonder he managed to sweet talk my other half.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.530
Dad, I don't know if it will work, but I've got an idea.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.240
Naruto, he's useless. He can't do anything.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.490
He couldn't even protect your mother.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.440
Nor his own subordinates.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.860
You know what tomorrow is, don't you?

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.530
It's the anniversary of Minato and Kushina's death...

00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:00.150
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Day Naruto Was Born"

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.570
The day both of your parents died.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:08.690
THE DAY NARUTO WAS BORN Tune in again!
