WEBVTT

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.790
W-What is that?

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.830
Katsuyu!

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.960
Yes, ma'am!

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.000
I shall explain everything!

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.540
Are you all right, Sakura...?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.670
Yeah... The Five Kage will be here shortly.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.330
Shikamaru!

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.000
Shikamaru!

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.580
Hey!

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.210
Hey, he looks real bad!

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.750
Lady Katsuyu!

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.750
Let's begin Distance Healing immediately!

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.170
That's not possible.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.330
Why?!

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.580
Even my mini fragments attached to everyone have been drained...

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.170
They have lost their chakra and died.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.960
That's...

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.540
In other words...

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.380
Everyone is in the same state as my fragments.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.250
Sorry, Dad...

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.420
Looks like I'll be right on your heels...

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.630
Shikamaru!

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.710
Sorry... Mom...

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.000
Shikamaru!
Sakura!

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.960
If we're going to die anyway,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.330
we might as well go down fighting to the best of our abilities!

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.000
But...at this rate...

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.790
...we'll all die before we even get to fight!

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.710
A Shinobi's Dream

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.080
Shinobi are done for.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.670
There's no need to keep going.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.540
If you don't resist, I won't kill you.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.580
If you keep opposing us,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.290
you'll continue to lose your comrades one by one!

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.630
This will become a world

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.710
where no one who acknowledges you will exist!

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.710
Unless you want to be filled with regret,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.630
stop and do nothing from here on out.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.000
If we don't do anything, we'll be saved...?

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.170
Yes...

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.290
You don't have to fear death or keep enduring anymore.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.040
You'll be entering a dream.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.080
Do not give up!

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.130
If you succumb to a genjutsu, you're no different from being dead!

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.290
This giant tree is closely connected to Obito...

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.170
They're like limbs that suck out chakra.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.460
We can't approach carelessly.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.630
Such words of weakness.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.040
So very unlike you.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.420
Sarutobi Sensei...

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.210
Orochimaru...

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.460
You're late... What of the Five Kage?

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.580
I had them healed.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.130
So as long as they don't chicken out, they should be coming.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.710
As sarcastic as ever, I see.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.710
Sorry I'm late, Jugo! Sasuke!

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.460
You're here...

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.960
This tree is huge now that I see it up close.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.710
I wonder how long it'll take to cut down?

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.040
Who cares about that?!

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.710
What's important right now...

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.130
...is to go over to Sasuke and hug and lick him, damn it!

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.330
Is to heal the Allied Forces shinobi, right?

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.670
Y-Yeah! I know that already, damn it!

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.540
He seems to be in a foul mood.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.210
What's going on?

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.880
When that bud blooms, Infinite Tsukuyomi will be complete.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.420
That's what Madara said.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.580
And yet, after depleting the chakra of this many shinobi...

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.000
the bud shows no signs of blooming.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.960
So when is it going to bloom?

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.080
The Eight and Nine Tails still live.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.330
Do you get it?

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.670
So the chakra of the Eight and Nine Tails is essential

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.540
to complete the jutsu...

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.170
However, if it contains even a small amount of each of their chakra,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.330
it's fine.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.130
In other words, it's not like it can't bloom.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.250
All that is affected....

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.380
is how long it will take to bloom.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.880
There's about 15 minutes to go.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.460
In that time, I shall stop Obito and switch places with him.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.960
Using your Sage Power.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.960
This is bad.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.000
Everything my original just heard must be relayed to the Allied Force.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.130
Anyone here belong to the Yamanaka Clan?!

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:54.880
Here!

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.210
Can you do the Mind Transmission Jutsu?!

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.040
Yes, I can, sir!

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.750
Good! Please link me to everyone here!

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.670
There are things I'd like to explain about that giant tree,

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.290
and the Infinite Tsukuyomi!

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:11.500
This sensation...

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.500
Grandfather!

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.580
Ah! Is that you, Tsuna?

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.130
This voice is unmistakably Lord Hashirama's!

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.250
This means the Five Kage are close enough

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.790
to be within range of my jutsu!

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.580
Oops! We'll have to reminisce later!

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.380
I have things I must relay to you five and everyone else!

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.500
Listen to me carefully!

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.580
I'll retrieve a little more chakra.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.630
It's taking too long for it to bloom.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.080
So we're just nourishment for that tree?

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.880
That's what shinobi are?!

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.670
Then...how are we supposed to fight it?

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.250
If there's only 15 minutes left, it's crazy!

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.080
We can't even get close to it!

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.960
And yet, doing nothing will yield the same result.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.290
We must either cut down that tree or

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.960
defeat the caster within the remaining time.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.790
But...

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.460
I told you not to give up hope!

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.380
That's what you say...

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.670
But you're a reanimated person from the past!

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.040
Brought back to life!

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.830
We're still alive!

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.380
It's all...over...

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.250
If it's going to end like this,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.710
we shouldn't have gotten started at all...

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.210
That's right. Just stay like that.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.500
I'll take you to a world where there are no regrets.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.170
Naruto, are you done?

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.670
Because I'm not.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.710
Let's go, Jugo.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.540
Yeah...

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.580
These are...

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.630
I can feel them, these are Naruto's feelings...

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.630
coming through my jutsu.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.830
Back then...

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.670
I knew I should've called out to him.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.710
I thought about it over and over afterwards.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.290
His thoughts are flowing in.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.710
That's why...

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.630
This is...

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:42.960
It's from that day...

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.670
I...

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.290
I...

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.500
I don't want to regret anything.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.920
I never want to think, "I should have..."!

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.790
Naruto...

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:18.420
And... I just can't make everything we've done...

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.210
up to this point meaningless!

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.290
Sasuke!

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.660
I'm coming too!

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.330
Naruto Uzumaki...

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.830
Time and time again...

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.240
Sorry to have to borrow more chakra.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.660
No worries!

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.870
Naruto, we're counting on you!

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.990
Hey, Sasuke...

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.950
You realize that only Sage Jutsu works on him, right?!

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.240
Don't compare me to you.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.540
Look, Karin...

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.700
Isn't that...Sasuke's Curse Mark patterning?

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.370
The Curse Mark is supposed to have lost its power...

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.660
Sage Power is the source of Jugo's Curse Mark.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.450
And with Sasuke,

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.290
back when I experimented with injecting Jugo's chakra into him,

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.370
he immediately unleashed the Curse Mark.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.990
So it's not surprising for Sasuke's Susano'o

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.910
to adapt to Jugo's chakra in similar fashion.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.200
In other words, you could call it a Sage Jutsu Susano'o.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.580
Sasuke Uchiha, huh?

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.830
He shows the same potential that Madara once did...

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.700
You Uchiha...

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.160
Maybe I'll go over there too...

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.870
You'll only be in the way.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.040
You'll get stabbed again.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.660
Bastard!

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.370
And Sasuke...

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.870
Unlike these two in the back, your power...

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.660
Rather, unlike any of my experiments...

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.240
your power is nothing like theirs... I can tell...

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.830
From my lifelong research and the data I've gathered...

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.080
my instincts tell me...

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.490
that you'll one day be a shinobi who surpasses Madara!

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.740
And Naruto Uzumaki...

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.870
You remind me so much of Elder Brother

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:46.830
when he was young.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.370
He's a foolish brat who spouts idealisms at the top of their voice.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:56.080
And yet, everyone likes and wants to depend on you.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:58.490
Aim!
Gotcha!

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.160
It'll be too late for regrets, you know.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.950
Not that there's going to be a future for either of you.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.540
Those two really went off to fight him?!

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.200
Yeah... so then what should we all do?

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.120
We can ask... when the Five Kage get here.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.830
Is that good enough?

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.410
I'm looking forward to the battles we'll fight...

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.740
...up until the time I achieve my true dream.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.080
What is your true dream?

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.330
I thought everything we've aimed for is here in this village!

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.040
You just can't see it.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.290
What's even further ahead... dreams of the far future.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.490
Then tell me about your dreams of the far future.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.910
These are Lord First's memories?

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.870
FIRE Dreams of the future... FIRE LIGHTNING

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.290
FIRE LIGHTNING WIND FIRE LIGHTNING WIND EARTH

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.580
FIRE LIGHTNING WIND EARTH WATER

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.790
The fact that we were able to convene this Five Kage Summit

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.160
with the first Kage of each of the Five Nations...

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.740
truly fills me...

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:13.580
...with gratitude!

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:17.660
Elder Brother!

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.200
You are the Hokage, representing the Hidden Leaf of the Land of Fire!

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.200
A person like you, need not bow to the other Kage!

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.330
But...I'm so happy!

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.240
Lord Hokage, raise your head...

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.830
That's not becoming of a village leader...

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:41.910
I did indeed come here to endorse the gist of Lord Hokage's pact,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.330
but I'm not just signing anything for free.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.790
If you behave too humbly, you'll make us suspicious.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.910
Distributing the Tailed Beasts that Lord Hokage has collected

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.200
to the other villages

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.660
is the condition of signing the treaty.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.910
This is a transaction, not something to get emotional over.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.290
Exactly, and we'll allocate the Tailed Beasts based on power,

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.200
but you will be acquiring them for a price.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.120
Not for free?

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.370
Shut up!

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.910
This was the very first summit!

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.660
Yes, and it was what would lead to the end of minor conflicts.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.450
In our village, a certain temple's disciples

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.200
have long been sealing away a Tailed Beast.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.950
Since we already have one, we do not need another.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.490
Instead, we would like an alternative compensation

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.580
for our collaboration in this pact.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.120
Would that be acceptable?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.370
What do you desire?

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.290
Our nation is completely covered in sand.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.080
Thus, we'd like the adjoining Leaf

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.290
to share arable land with us instead of a Tailed Beast.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.740
And the other nations to hand over 30%

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.790
of your Tailed Beast purchase price as well.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.790
Don't mess around, Kazekage!

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:10.450
What—?!

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.490
You overstep your bounds, Lord Kazekage!

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:17.540
I won't sign on unless all of you accept these terms!

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.160
Mine is a desert-locked nation with zero fertility!

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.200
It's only natural to use my village's Tailed Beast to full advantage

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.200
in dealings with the four other Great Nations!

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.240
We four nations could join up...

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.080
and defeat the Land of Wind...

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.160
It's true that we've never gotten along in the past...

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:58.330
But we each did what we did to protect our brethren and clans.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.330
There were, perhaps, times when we had no other choice.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:06.040
And now, today, even if our Five Nation Treaty comes to be...

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.410
I can't say how long it will last...

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.290
or if we can even hold to it.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:17.830
But I have this dream, That sometime in the future...

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.040
There will come a day when shinobi will collaborate,

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.040
and help each other, with one heart, regardless of their affiliation.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.080
That is my... My dream of the future.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.830
I ask you to take the first step toward that dream today!

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:43.580
So please, please, please, please...

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.160
I beg you!

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.160
All of my, our beloved children!

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.370
Now is the time to take all the pain,

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.740
the suffering, and frustration we shinobi have endured...

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.830
and weave it into

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.080
Our true dream!

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.100
Your past is filtering into me through the others.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:47.060
Naruto Uzumaki, you are uniting everyone right now.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.440
Your tempestuous life made you into who you are.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.730
And your way of life has instilled hope in everyone!

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.560
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Pursuing Hope."

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.690
Let's go! Let's cut down that tree!

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.810
PURSUING HOPE Tune in again!
