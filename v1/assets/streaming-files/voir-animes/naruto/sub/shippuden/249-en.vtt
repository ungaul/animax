WEBVTT

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.570
Gaara… Don't overexert yourself!

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.860
I'm no longer a Jinchuriki…

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.940
So...

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.320
I can finally pull all-nighters with you as an equal!

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.980
Gaara… You…

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.730
There's no need to distinguish between human and beast.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.150
…remind me of Bunpuku.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.070
Damn it!

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.320
Hey, Kazekage brat!

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.690
Do me a favor!

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.320
All right…

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.360
You got that… Gaara?!

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.940
Naruto!

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.870
A True Ending

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.620
Shukaku!

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.670
Sorry… Bee!

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.540
I'm counting on you… Kazekage brat!

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.170
I don't believe it… They've all been sucked in!

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.920
Well, I guess...

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.330
that's about all I can expect from my current strength.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.960
It took more than a few seconds...

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.040
But you were faster than Obito.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.830
You really do talk too much.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.250
You're all dud inventions of mine...

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.750
Always finding fault with me.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.870
Black Zetsu is nicknamed "Wicked Tongue"

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.960
and they call us White Zetsu, "Wagging Tongues."

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.370
I hope the other battle is going well.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.460
Don't worry! After all, the base is good.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.290
Flying Raijin Slice!

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.330
You're mine!

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.210
This is my chance!

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.250
Naruto…

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.500
Gaara... Gaara!

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.790
Naruto…

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.790
I swear I will not let you die!

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.040
Like I'd let you die!

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.750
It's your M.O. to strike an opponent when he's convinced of victory...

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.290
Making the brats do the work...

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.250
You're still a delegator, aren't you, Tobirama?

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.960
Same goes for you.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.170
However, heaven is on my side.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.670
Look at you, the one touted as the fastest shinobi ever.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.790
There's a reason why you two brothers

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.000
can't regain your former speed.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.920
Whether it's coincidence or if it's inevitable...

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.870
I've got the edge now.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.210
Plus I'm nurturing a new eye.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.420
Though it's unclear which side they'll end up on...

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.170
Wait!

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.670
Uchiha lad…

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.290
Let me give you a jutsu.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.000
A jutsu?

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:55.960
Yes… Madara stole my Sage Chakra…

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.710
This jutsu will respond to the Sage Chakra and bind him.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.960
Then do it yourself…

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.870
If you're a reanimation, you'll recover right away.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:07.960
If you want…

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.420
I'll pull those things out of your back for you.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.710
These rods seem to be piercing my Chakra Points,

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.920
preventing me from infusing more chakra.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.830
Also, I think it's a bad idea for you to touch them.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.960
I will give you all of my remaining chakra.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.000
You must stop Madara…

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.960
Why ask me, an Uchiha?

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.790
You're a lot like him...

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Madara's younger brother…

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.500
Izuna Uchiha.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.080
So? What does that have to do with stopping him?

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.870
Madara's fundamentally a kind man.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.460
He was very devout and loved his siblings.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.000
That's why he gave you a chance at redemption.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.620
But killing you would be such a waste with an eye like that.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.830
How about it? You're a survivor of the Uchiha like me.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.370
Want to join forces?

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:19.790
Make no mistake. You're a dead man.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.620
Fine then…

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.080
In any case, you don't have much time left yourself.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.250
You might be able to stop Madara without using force.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.000
Now…come stand before me.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.960
To be honest...

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.080
I've wanted to do this to you for a long time.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.870
Since you're…

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.710
the one who killed Izuna!

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.540
But you're just a moving corpse, so it's hardly fulfilling.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.620
Madara… What is it that you so desire so badly

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.330
that you'd come back to life for?

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.370
Our era, our time ended… ages ago!

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.370
I just want to build the nation that Hashirama couldn't.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.790
But this world belongs to Hashirama, my predecessor who failed.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.920
Drastic measures are needed to save the dying patient.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.830
I'm going on ahead!

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.250
So this thing called the Infinite Tsukuyomi was your idea?

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.040
This is your idea of a cure?

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.040
Yes. Hashirama's nation-building bore a paradox.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.500
People desire peace...

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.330
And yet, on the other hand, crave conflict as well.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.330
That duality is mankind.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.870
To only want peace and to discard conflict...

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.920
would cause people to stop being people.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.790
And those two things stand together side by side.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:27.580
Be they a friend...sibling... or even my own child...

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.370
I will not forgive anyone who threatens the village.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.620
People will sacrifice something in order to protect something else.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.870
Except in a true dream world.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.790
You've got a point.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.290
But…it's not a dream

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.330
that you should interfere with!

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.710
Now.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.710
You could say that this world is

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.420
Hashirama's paradox world.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:11.670
Damn it!

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.370
What is this?!

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.500
In order to protect something…

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.790
one must sacrifice something else.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.460
Stop, Madara!

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:33.250
Don't go any further… "Be they a friend...sibling..."

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.370
"or even my own child…"

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.750
I gave you plenty of time.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.210
And I warned you… that there wasn't much time left.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.580
How unfortunate.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.610
Madara!

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.020
What kind of a man are you?!

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.610
It's coming again!

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.070
My jutsu won't activate!

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.480
My chakra is—!

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.490
I can't believe we've been stopped by the likes of him...

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.020
This strange thing... It's blocking our way!

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.020
It's using the Wood Style… What is it?

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.270
I told you, I wouldn't let you pass so easily.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.020
By the way, isn't there anyone who can give me

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.730
a serious answer to my question?

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.820
I asked you, what does it feel like to poo?

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.940
Well… I'm thinking it's like the refreshing feeling you get

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.230
after killing someone.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.980
All five elements at once?!

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.520
How do we counter that?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.360
I know!

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.480
Impressive…

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.690
Using the same jutsu simultaneously as a counterbalance…

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.110
We're saved.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.070
Don't underestimate Lord Third!

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.940
That said, everyone's exhausted most of their chakra.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.480
Which leaves only a reanimated Lord Third to fight back.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.610
If Lord Third should fall, we're done for...

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.940
Forget Madara. We need to do something about him.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.650
To be honest... Everyone needs to start fighting as if

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.110
Lady Tsunade, Shizune and I aren't able to use Medical Ninjutsu anymore.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.360
This large-scale battle using big attacks is taking too long!

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.070
And we haven't had a chance to regroup.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.110
We'll just have trust young Naruto to take care of Madara.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.480
This is our chance, Lord Orochimaru!

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.860
Not yet.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.320
This foe…

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.440
No way!

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.400
Shh! Be quiet!

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.020
No way! This is—!

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:57.570
What is it?

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.320
S-Sa…

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.610
Did something happen to Sasuke?

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.650
It seems I should do it sooner than later, after all...

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.400
What is it, Ino?

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:13.980
Naruto!

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.110
What?

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.820
What is that?! That's Lord Gaara's…!

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.360
Over there!

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.190
Naruto!

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.730
There's no time to explain.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.570
Hokage! Come with me!

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.980
Heal Naruto as much you can while we're en route.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.820
I've depleted my chakra. I can't use Medical Ninjutsu anymore.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.520
Take Sakura. She can still help a little.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.940
How did Naruto end up like this?!

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.940
What happened over there?!

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.360
Just come!

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.730
Don't waste time! I'll explain later!

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.570
Quickly, Sakura, get on the sand!

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.570
Right!

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.150
How could this happen?!

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.690
Is Naruto there?

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.360
Yeah! Over there!

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.190
Can't you use your Byakugan?

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.110
Did he bring down Madara?

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.820
Naruto's heartbeat… is getting weaker and weaker!

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:42.520
Naruto!

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.660
Neji, please protect Naruto!

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.070
Naruto Uzumaki…

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.610
We're talking about the Uzumaki Clan,

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.230
so I'm sure he's going to be stubborn…

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.730
But trying to do anything for him is useless.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.770
A Jinchuriki dies when the Tailed Beast is extracted.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.940
– That's an absolute rule! – That's an absolute rule!

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.940
The fact that you possess such eyes proves

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.770
that you've continued to seek something despite many great losses.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.270
But it all ends here.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.650
You will lose your very self.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.480
It's what they call a true ending.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.520
I always lied to you and asked you to forgive me.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.770
Deliberately keeping you at a distance by my own hand.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.820
All because I didn't want you to get caught up in any of this.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.150
But now, I believe…

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.320
That perhaps you could have changed Father, Mother,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.820
and the rest of the Uchiha.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.230
I will love you always.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.020
I'm not dying.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.320
I…can't…die.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.400
I can't let Itachi's life...be in vain!

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.690
No matter what darkness or contradictions lie within the village...

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.370
I am still Itachi Uchiha of the Leaf!

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.370
Not yet…not here…

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.250
Until I build a true village…

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.200
and become a true Kage.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.500
I'm...

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
not gonna die!

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.950
Hang in there! Don't give up!

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.080
You are strong! You will make it!

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.080
My chakra's almost all...!

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.660
S-Sasuke is—!

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.310
What's wrong, Karin?

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.510
Sasuke is really going to—!

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.300
At this rate... At this rate, Naruto's going to…

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.860
– …die! – ...die!

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.540
To think Naruto would end up like this!

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.880
Sakura, I leave Naruto in your hands!

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.250
Naruto, you have always been our village's symbol of hope.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:53.460
You were in everyone's thoughts as they trained!

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.910
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The New Chunin Exams"

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.750
Yes, ever since that time... THE NEW CHUNIN EXAMS

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:08.790
Tune in again!
