WEBVTT

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.400
Oh boy…

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.970
Hey…

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.800
Where's Sakura?

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.770
Huh? Oh…

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.870
You were going after Sasuke, right?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.570
So which way did Sakura go?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.270
North…towards two o'clock.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.670
About one kilometer.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.070
That Sakura…

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.830
Looks like she learned how to concoct a powerful drug

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.370
from Lady Tsunade.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.870
They won't be getting up for a while.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.630
There we go.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.530
Sorry, there's no time so I'm going on ahead.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.200
What’s in it for me if you come along?

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.570
What are you plotting?

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.430
I'm not plotting anything!

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.730
Ever since you left the Hidden Leaf Village,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.570
I've regretted not going with you!

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.500
Is she an old teammate?

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.200
And she’s also in love with Sasuke? But…

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.130
I'll do whatever you want.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.100
I don't want to have any more regrets.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.200
And do you know what I want?

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.030
I don't care! I'll do whatever you ask.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.330
I'm going to destroy the Hidden Leaf!

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.270
That's what I want!

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.300
Will you really be able betray the Hidden Leaf for me?

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.500
Yes. If you asked me to.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.330
Then prove it.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.970
Finish her off.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.270
Then I'll believe you.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.330
Who is she?

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.730
A member of the group, Taka, which I founded.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.730
As you can see, she's useless.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.100
Sakura, you're a Medical Ninja, right?

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.900
You can replace her. This will work out just fine.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.200
How could he? He's definitely not the old Sasuke.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.070
He's completely changed.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.600
Well, Sakura? You can’t do it?

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.400
She has nothing to do with this.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.870
If I… If I stab Sasuke now…

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.930
it will all be over.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.400
Stop, Sasuke.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.830
He really meant to kill her.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.970
How you’ve fallen, Sasuke.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.230
One after another.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.470
Sakura, you tried to kill Sasuke by yourself, didn't you?

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.470
You don't have to shoulder such a heavy burden by yourself.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.770
I was the leader of Team 7.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.030
It was my cowardice that split all of you up.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.770
Sakura…

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.930
I said something irresponsible to you

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.370
in an effort to put you at ease.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.770
Kakashi Sensei…

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.370
Don’t worry. It will be like it was before!

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.530
I must have been trying to convince myself of that too.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.970
I’m sorry I’m such a careless Sensei.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.970
But you’re…

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.170
Sasuke…

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.900
I don't like to repeat myself.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.500
But I'll say this once more.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.330
I've seen so many guys like you, I've lost count.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.400
Those who follow the path of revenge end up nowhere.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.330
Do not become possessed by vengeance!

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.000
Itachi… My father… My mother…

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.870
My entire clan! Bring them all here!

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.200
Do that and I’ll quit right now!

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.370
I don't want to kill you.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.970
You talk like you could kill me at any time!

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.200
Stop acting like you’re still my Sensei.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.570
I'm itching to kill you…

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Kakashi.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.970
He’s been completely twisted by Madara.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.700
Sakura… Heal that girl to the point that she can speak.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.470
We still have time right now.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.400
She knows a lot of intel about the enemy.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.970
What about you, Sensei?

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.430
Take that girl and get away from here.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.570
Kakashi Sensei…

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.370
I will take on what would have been your burden.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.930
I guess you could say it's my responsibility.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.000
All right?

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.600
Hurry and go, Sakura.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.130
As the leader of Team 7, I will settle this once and for all.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.870
I don't like repeating myself either.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.800
But stop acting like you’re my Sensei.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.500
No matter how far he had fallen,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.230
he was still dear to you, wasn't he?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.470
Third Hokage…

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.370
Even though you had nurtured many other fine pupils…

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.030
A cherished student abandons the village.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.630
The agony of having to face that dear student in battle.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.730
No one can begin to imagine the resolve it took.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.800
Now I finally understand how the Third Hokage must have felt.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.000
You will go the same way as the Third Hokage!

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.600
The Burden

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.000
You… Don’t talk yet! Just a little longer.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.870
You’re the enemy, I don’t want to know how you feel.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.700
So…stop crying in front of me…

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.930
with such a sad face!

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.300
Damn it.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.070
All right.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.500
The Sharingan is proof of being an Uchiha.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.870
A lowlife ninja who isn't an Uchiha…

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.000
has no right showing off that eye!

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.930
The path of those shuriken…

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.230
Sasuke is used to real combat!

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.170
Well then… Earth Style: Mud Wall!

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.530
For someone whose Sharingan is borrowed,

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.470
you're quite skilled in using it.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.830
However, can your Sharingan do this?

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.430
I will show you…

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.900
that my Sharingan is in a completely different class than yours!

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.200
This is…

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.770
So fast.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.800
If I hadn't blown it away with the Mangekyo,

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.170
I'd be dead right now.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.030
So that's the Susano'o?

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.470
To think that someone who’s not an Uchiha

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.570
could awaken the Mangekyo.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.870
So it seems that eye’s power saved you.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.170
You should be grateful to the power of the Uchiha.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.600
Sasuke…

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.700
You are more than just your clan. More than just hatred.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.930
Look deep inside your heart. One more time.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.900
Are you still going on about that?

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.970
Deep down, you know.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.400
You’re all laughing.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.070
They're all laughing.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.200
You’re laughing at the cost of Itachi’s life!

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.900
Laughing together, completely ignorant of everything!

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.370
Your laughing voices sound like contempt

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.900
and mocking to me now!

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.670
I will change those laughs to screams and wails!

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.630
Sasuke… Sasuke's chakra… has gotten even colder.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.930
Sasuke isn't the Sasuke you knew anymore.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.600
This is bad!

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:49.870
How’s this?

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.070
So can your borrowed Sharingan extinguish that?!

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.830
I will show you the difference between the real thing and a fake!

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:09.000
Damn it!

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.200
My sight!

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.670
What is she going to do?

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.600
Sakura! Why are you here?

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.070
Don’t!

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.970
I won't let Kakashi Sensei bear the burden!

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.500
Do you think Naruto will calmly accept our decision?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.800
But this is something we all decided.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.070
We have to make him understand.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.970
I'll talk to Naruto about everything.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.270
You, Sakura?

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.700
Do you have a plan that'll work?

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.470
Just leave everything to me.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.600
How can I tell Naruto something like this?!

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.670
I have to take care of this.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.700
I have to stay committed.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.100
Hey!

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.470
Can you let me through?

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.600
Get outta the way, Naruto!

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.130
I want to sit over there.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.600
Sasuke…

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.700
Mind if I sit next to you?

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.570
I'm going to get Sasuke today!

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.830
I’ll be the one to get the first kiss! Cha!

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:55.000
I'll give you guys one more chance!

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.930
However, after noon it'll be a harsher battle to take the bells!

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.330
Those who want to take on the challenge can eat lunch.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.870
However, don't let Naruto have any.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.430
It's punishment for breaking the rules and

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.770
attempting to eat lunch on your own.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.570
If someone lets him eat

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.230
that person will be disqualified on the spot.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.930
I make the rules here.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:17.930
Got it?!

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.000
Here.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.870
H-Hey, Sasuke. Sensei just said…

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.670
It's okay. There's no sign of him now.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.770
In the afternoon, the three of us will go and get the bells.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.430
It'll be trouble for me if he becomes a hindrance, so…

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.330
Sasuke…

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.800
Sakura…

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.030
Thanks.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.470
You guys!

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.570
You pass!

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.770
You guys are the first.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.130
Up until now, I only had dunces

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.900
who would just meekly listen to what I said.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.100
A ninja must see through deception.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.570
In the ninja world, those who break the rules are scum.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:26.600
But those who abandon their friends are worse than scum.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.170
That's it for the exercise. Everyone passes.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.870
Why are you hanging around a place like this

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.870
in the middle of the night?

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.170
It’s because you use this path to leave the Village.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.330
I always…

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.470
Go home and sleep.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.570
Why won’t you tell me anything?

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.430
Why are you always silent?

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.070
You won’t tell me one single thing.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.230
I’m telling you to keep your nose out of my business.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.970
Stop fussing over everything I do.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.670
I always…

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.930
end up making you hate me, don’t I?

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.470
Do you remember?

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:36.430
We just made genin and the three-man squads were assigned.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.230
You and I were alone for the first time,

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.670
here in this very spot.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.070
You got mad at me.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.070
Solitude…

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.870
It isn’t the same as being sad

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.730
because your parents scolded you.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.870
What’s the matter all of a sudden?

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.600
You…are annoying.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.230
I don’t remember that.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.070
Yeah, I guess.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.800
That was long ago after all.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.970
But it all began that day.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.170
You and me…

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.130
And also Naruto and Kakashi Sensei.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.570
The four of us went on various missions.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.070
Those were tough and difficult times, but…

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.600
But more than anything, it was so much fun.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.530
I know about your clan, Sasuke.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.100
But revenge that won’t bring anyone happiness. No one.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.730
Neither you nor I.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:42.830
As I expected.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.070
I’m different from you guys.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.870
I’m walking a road that’s incompatible with the rest of you.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.230
The four of us worked together…

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.600
and it’s true that there was a time when I thought that was my road.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.500
The four of us worked together,

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.400
but in the end, I decided on revenge.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.070
That’s been my reason for living.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.470
I can’t be like you or Naruto.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.730
Are you going to isolate yourself again, Sasuke?!

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.470
Back then, you taught me that solitude is suffering, Sasuke.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.330
Now I know exactly how that feels.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.100
I have both family and friends.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.200
But if you were no longer here, Sasuke…

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.570
for me it would be the same as solitude.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.200
From here…

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.030
we’re going to start walking down our new paths individually.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.400
I…I love you so very, very much, Sasuke!

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.400
If you would only be with me, Sasuke,

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.000
I wouldn't let you regret it, no matter what!

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.930
I’ll do anything for you, Sasuke!

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.800
So…I’m begging you, please stay here!

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.730
I’ll even help you with your revenge!

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.570
I’ll make it happen somehow, I promise you!

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.700
So stay here with me!

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.630
If that doesn’t work for you, then take me with you.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.600
You really are…annoying.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:13.600
Don't go!

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.670
If you go, I'll scream and…

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.430
Sakura…

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:26.770
Thank you.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.200
I was sure…I was prepared.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.770
Sakura!

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.870
Damn it!

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.230
This always happens right after I use the Mangekyo!

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.730
Stop, Sasuke!

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.470
Naruto?!

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400
Naruto…

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.470
Sasuke, I’m going to save you from the chaos of your vengeance.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.370
I don’t need that.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.470
The stage has already been set for my vengeance to happen!

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:48.570
What?

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.530
Severing all bonds with the Leaf

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.700
shall lead to the Uchiha’s true restoration!

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:59.600
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Two Fates"

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.000
I guess we just have to do this then.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.270
Tune in again!
