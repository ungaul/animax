WEBVTT

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.870
I consider you my friend.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.500
In the past, "friend" was merely a word to me.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.470
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.300
But after meeting you, you made me realize that…

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.570
the meaning of that word is what's important.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.770
What does it mean?

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.900
What can you do for Sasuke?

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.400
Think hard about that.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.430
Danzo… Just what kind of jutsu does he use?

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.030
W-What? That right arm…

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.200
It has many Sharingan! It's disgusting!

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.430
How did you get those eyes in your right arm?

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.630
Through various means. It would take too long to describe.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.330
Any explanation would upset me more.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.700
Forget it. I've decided to kill you.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.200
Before that, let me ask one thing.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.270
Is it true that Itachi Uchiha eliminated my clan by order of the Elders?

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.430
This is…

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.570
So that’s Sasuke's…

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.770
So this is the Susano'o.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.670
Danzo's Right Arm

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.470
So? What do we do now?

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.200
In any case, I think we should return to the Hidden Leaf

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.570
and report what happened at the summit.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.130
And also about Sakura.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.930
The real me is accompanying Sakura.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.500
She won't be allowed to get near Sasuke!

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.270
You can count on that.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.300
But it would be better to go in person and talk her out of it.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:02.670
All right.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.300
Yamato, take Naruto and head back to the village.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.800
I'll bring Sakura back.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.670
Sakura is no match for Sasuke.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.300
It would be like she’s going there to die.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.800
I'll dispatch the Ninja Hounds with a report

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.530
about the summit since it's urgent.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.700
Understood.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.170
Sai… Take me to Sakura.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.170
Yes.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.170
What the hell do you guys want?

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.600
You were just talking about Sasuke!

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.030
Tell us what you were saying!

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.670
It's got nothing to do with you Cloud Ninja!

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.000
It's got everything to do with us!

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.300
Sasuke Uchiha of the Hidden Leaf attacked our village!

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.000
Your Rogue Ninja abducted our master!

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.870
We don't even know if our master is dead or alive, you idiots!

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.500
Th-That's a lie!

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.430
Why would Sasuke do such a thing?!

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.270
Like we'd know what the Akatsuki's motives are!

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.430
The Akatsuki? What do you mean?

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.870
Huh? Don’t kid around.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.800
Sasuke is a member of the Akatsuki!

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.270
You guys let your Rogue Ninja roam free,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.500
so Lord Raikage ordered us to come here!

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.030
And we've gotten your Hokage's permission to get rid of the Uchiha!

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.630
Sasuke abducted their master?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.830
We'll get our revenge!

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.030
The Uchiha is ours!

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.470
Itachi Uchiha… His life was one of personal sacrifice.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.330
For the village and more importantly, for his younger brother.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.030
Sasuke lost everything, and he was left all alone,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.230
in exchange for peace in Hidden Leaf Village.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.570
Can you still blame Sasuke?

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.800
Sasuke said that he couldn’t forgive the Hidden Leaf

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.130
for sacrificing Itachi's life to secure peace.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.270
He is doing everything out of a desire for revenge.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.630
He is the real thing. A true avenger.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.930
Hatred… It is Sasuke's Ninja Way!

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.370
The Hidden Leaf will deal with Sasuke.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.200
Every one of your comrades is committed to that

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.800
and will act accordingly.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.170
Sakura is not a fool.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.530
She’s not a child who wouldn't understand

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.930
the difficulty of the situation.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.900
Sakura intends to kill Sasuke herself.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.300
If you are prepared to bear the burden of being a Kage,

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.330
then do what is right as Sasuke's friend.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.400
Naruto, is something wrong?

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.000
Calm down, Naruto!

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.500
He's hyperventilating.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.100
Breathe slowly.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:56.830
Naruto!

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.300
Naruto…Can you hear me? Naruto?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.570
I'm going to ask you one more time.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.430
Is it true that Itachi Uchiha eliminated my clan by order of the Elders?

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.830
I'm asking if it's true!

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.070
Answer me!

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.230
I… I didn’t think he was that kind of man.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.930
Damn Itachi. I see he revealed everything to you before he died.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:46.430
As I thought… It seems that you are truly special.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:53.000
By making revenge your goal, he hoped to make you strong.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.070
I acted like the older brother you desired

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.730
in order to measure your vessel.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.930
You will become a rival to measure my vessel against.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.930
You have that hidden potential.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.030
You’ve been jealous of me and resented me.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.370
You’ve harbored hopes of surpassing me.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.100
That is why I am allowing you to live. For my sake.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.830
My foolish little brother…

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.000
If you wish to kill me, resent me, hate me.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.970
And survive…in obscurity.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.800
Run…keep running… and cling to life.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.270
Then one day,

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.900
come before me with the same eyes that I possess.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.230
The Uchiha is a proud clan of the Hidden Leaf.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.500
He wanted you to keep believing that.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.870
He beseeched the Hokage that you never learn the truth.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.800
And from the time he left the village,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.430
he was resolved to fighting you and dying.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.570
You really have gotten stronger…

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.070
Sasuke.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.270
So that he could instill in you a new power.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.500
He accepted disgrace in the place of honor,

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.600
and hate in the place of love.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:23.300
And despite that, Itachi died with a smile on his face.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.400
He entrusted the Uchiha name to you, his younger brother,

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.430
deceiving you to the very end.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.430
Lies! They’re all lies… Answer me!

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:43.770
I… I didn't think Itachi was the kind of man who would reveal secrets.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.370
Does that mean it's true?

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.530
Self-sacrifice… That’s what epitomizes a shinobi.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:27.370
Never seeing the light of day. Toiling in the shadows.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.400
It is as it was in the past. That is what a true shinobi is.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.330
It describes not only Itachi.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.300
Countless other ninja have died the same way.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.200
Niceties alone will not make the world go round.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.770
Peace was attained all because of people like him.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.100
People like you who misunderstood Itachi's intentions

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.730
couldn't possibly understand.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.570
Still…for Itachi to reveal such a secret to you makes him

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.200
a traitor to the Leaf…

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.130
Don’t say anymore about Itachi!

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.330
You’re right.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.070
Then let us proceed to a battle of the eyes.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.670
What's going on?!

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.670
He should've died earlier!

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.170
I can only sense chakra from one Danzo.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.200
I'm certain it's not a clone!

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.100
As expected…Susano'o.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.970
Just the thing to protect yourself.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.430
The power in its attack is as expected.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.030
Again? So if that wasn't a clone either…

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.300
Is it genjutsu?!

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.630
Sasuke's inner chakra isn't disturbed.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.970
And my chakra is calm.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.470
If neither Sasuke nor I am under a genjutsu…

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.370
Then…

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.030
what kind of jutsu is this?

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.530
Amaterasu!

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.330
Susano'o and even Amaterasu…

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.970
That's too much just to test Danzo's power.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.670
He'll tire himself out.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.070
Sasuke! Behind you!

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.430
Wind Style: Vacuum Bullets!

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.100
Sasuke!

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.030
Summoning Jutsu!

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.500
A new summoning jutsu?

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.030
When did he get that?

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.630
Amaterasu. It's been a while since I last saw that.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.470
You are Itachi's younger brother after all.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.830
You’ve taken over Itachi's jutsu.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.970
I told you never to speak of Itachi again!

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.970
Brothers with the same ability.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Yet, what your eyes perceive is so different.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.930
The truth about Itachi isn't important to you.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:15.870
You direct your hatred at whomever you can lay your hands on.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.770
You make the sacrifice of the Uchiha Clan meaningless.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:26.200
You have no right to talk about the Uchiha!

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.070
Wind Style: Vacuum Blast!

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.500
Sasuke!

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.170
This is…

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.770
No way!

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.230
It's useless.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.570
Th-This is…

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.630
Itachi?

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:42.300
Why did you hand over your life for this child, Itachi?

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.770
He misinterpreted your intentions,

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.930
he charges ahead with only hatred as his rationale. He is a fool.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:54.930
Look closely, Itachi, this is your one and only mistake.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.900
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: “The Forbidden Visual Jutsu”

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:04.030
I will correct your mistake.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.100
It is finally time for me to be in charge of a mini-corner!

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.970
Now that I’m here, I’m going to make sure you feel

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.630
the passion, the friendship, the sweat, the struggle, the gutsiness—

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.830
Palm Heel Strike!

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.430
At least you got to appear in the main story.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.100
My situation’s getting worse and worse.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.700
I’ll be taking this mini-corner.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.770
I won’t let you do this by yourself.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.530
ADORABLE TENTEN If we’re doing a mini-corner,

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.130
why not feature me, a cute, strong, and popular…

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.030
Idiots! All of us have had little screen time recently.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.030
We’re all in the same situation. Am I right or not?

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.800
Guy Sensei…

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.200
Therefore…

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:50.400
I will give you a hot, young, and awesome mini-corner.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.600
I call it… You just want to show off!

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:54.900
Who are you kidding?!

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.170
…me Might Guy, with overflowing youth

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.970
going at a great ultra-super full swing, will bring everyone…

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.730
Tune in again!
