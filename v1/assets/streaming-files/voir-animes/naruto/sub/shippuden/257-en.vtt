WEBVTT

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.260
Now, hurry!

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.420
Oh no, you don't!

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.470
Kamui!

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.170
The Infinite Dream

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.090
Sakura!

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.420
Kakashi Sensei.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.090
Sasuke?!

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.960
Why did you pop up here, Sakura?

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.010
She was in the Time-Space plane…

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.050
Sakura, what's going on over there?

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.960
Kakashi Sensei, your left eye!

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.170
It all happened so quickly.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.050
But I think Madara stole my Sharingan.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.960
Let me take a look, Sensei!

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.380
Thanks.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.670
In any case, what happened to Obito?

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.170
I'm sure Madara used the Kamui to teleport himself there!

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.090
In a flash, I was back out here, so…

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.550
Madara…

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.880
I want you to destroy my left eye,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920
the one that has the Rinnegan.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.960
I can't even move now…

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.550
If I let down my guard, even just a little bit…

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.260
Black Zetsu will take over my body, Rinnegan and all.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.050
Then he'll use my right eye's Visual Prowess to get back outside…

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.590
…and the Rinnegan will fall into Madara's hands.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.920
If he ends up with both eyes, terrible things will happen.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.460
Terrible things?

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.800
How much worse can it get? Hasn't he done enough?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.090
I wasn't able to implant both Rinnegan myself.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.630
Even with just this left eye,

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.050
its chakra and Visual Prowess are so strong

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.880
that I started losing myself.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.710
I'm not even its original owner,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.050
yet I was able to accomplish this much with just one.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.340
If both Rinnegan are restored to their true owner,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.630
I fear no one will be able to stand against him…

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.880
But that's—!

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.050
With Visual Prowess, only with both eyes together

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.920
can their full power be unleashed.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.880
We can't waste any time. Please destroy this left eye!

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.630
What's wrong, Sakura?!

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.090
We're in trouble!

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.090
Obito had reached his limit and couldn't move…

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.590
Which means Madara's going to get Obito's Rinnegan!

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.590
The Cursed Seal Tag I placed on your heart has disappeared.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.550
How did you remove it?

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.960
You shouldn't have been able to damage it yourself.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.760
I had Kakashi stab me and remove it.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.960
This is all I can do right now.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.630
Since it was in the way of me making myself

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.630
into the Ten Tails' Jinchuriki…

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.090
I gambled my life on it…

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.300
But I wasn't going to keep doing what you wanted!

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.800
Actually, you did exactly what I wanted you to do.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.050
In fact, you exceeded my hopes.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.630
What's so funny?

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.210
A Curse Seal Tag meant to turn you into a puppet…

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.050
One that would restrict your movements,

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.130
should you try to remove it from inside the body it's implanted in.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.800
It seems you knew about it, Obito.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.880
Regarding these Cursed Tags I implanted in the two of you…

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.880
Naturally, you couldn't have killed yourselves either.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.010
Since you both were my precious pawns.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.920
"You both"…?

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.210
As fate would have it…

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.590
It's ironic that both of you ended up

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.840
getting rid of them through the exact same method.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.340
Rin!

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.460
Yes.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.170
That plot to make that girl into the Three Tails' Jinchuriki

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.090
and have her rampage through the Leaf Village was mine.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.010
Not the Hidden Mist's!

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.840
That girl took advantage of Kakashi's attack against the enemy

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.760
to avert the plot, at the cost of her life.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.670
But that was also part of my plan…

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.760
In order to pitch you into darkness

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.880
and make you into my pawn.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.300
You bastard, you deliberately had me see all that!

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.420
I waited for the opportunity,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.800
when Minato was away on another mission.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.010
And manipulated the Mist Shinobi into kidnapping Rin,

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.090
leaving Kakashi so he would come after her.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.630
The other purpose of that

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.960
was so I could see the extent of your unleashed power.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.090
Did you really think that White Zetsu goading you on,

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.880
and you being able to get out from underground right at that moment

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.090
was all a big coincidence?

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.960
I was just outside!

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.960
Your friends Rin and stupid Kakashi are in trouble!

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.420
What happened?!

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.920
They're alone and completely surrounded

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.510
by Hidden Mist Shinobi!

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.550
How are Rin and Kakashi doing right now?

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.010
According to the others, it looks pretty bad.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.170
They're talking about some Hidden Mist test subjects…

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.170
but I don't really understand.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.130
Test subjects?

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.510
Anyway, it seems Rin and Kakashi are totally surrounded.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.960
And they're saying they all appear

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.210
to be jonin or Black Ops.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.960
What's Minato Sensei doing?

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.090
Who is that?

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.760
I'm asking you what the Yellow Flash is doing!

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.590
Seems he's on a different mission.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.710
At a time like this?!

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.300
That the girl dying by Kakashi's hand

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.960
was more than I could have hoped for.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.380
Either way, I would have had my Puppet Shinobi kill her.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.050
I taught you to use the darkness in people's hearts…

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.260
to manipulate them, didn't I, Obito?

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.590
If there isn't any darkness, you can create some.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.010
Don't you think it's presumptuous to consider yourself any different?

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.510
Why? Why me?!

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.380
You were kind and cared about people from the bottom of your heart.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.920
Remember how great you were at taking care of the elderly?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.670
Your deep love for Rin… for your comrades and friends…

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.170
for the Hokage and all other shinobi…

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.920
Once you fell into darkness, it would conversely transform

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.510
into an equally profound hatred for this world.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.960
That's the kind of guy you are.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.880
For my plan to work completely,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.340
I just need one more thing…

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.920
I'll be taking back that left eye.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.880
This should do it!

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.340
You can't move anymore.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.920
I'm leaving him to you!

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.050
Right! You can count on me!

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.050
It seems Madara appeared there.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.420
I see… So that's what Obito said.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.010
We don't know when Madara might emerge. Stay alert.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.920
What about his shadow?

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.920
I stopped him cold with

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.210
my Shadow Clones and Six Paths' Rods!

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.130
Naruto?

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.920
Hey, Sakura… Let me do it!

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.670
What are you trying to do, Naruto?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.800
Hey!

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.300
It's okay, it's okay.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.630
Kakashi Sensei, try opening your eye.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.170
No way! How did you do that?

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.050
It's really hard to explain in words…

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.760
But I took a part of Kakashi Sensei,

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.630
and then I kinda…um…uhh…

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.130
Hey, Naruto… I told everyone to stay alert!

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.170
What?

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.880
But it's the first time I'm hearing of it!

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.050
Quit talking back for once, Naruto!

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.880
Anyway, you'll have to explain about the eye later!

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.050
Madara stole Kakashi's eye and went to where Obito is.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.920
The next time he appears, he'll have both Rinnegan!

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.840
What? Really?

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.880
Let's see, we'll start with the introductions.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.710
I'll go! I'll go!

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.630
I'm Naruto Uzumaki!

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.710
I love instant cup ramen.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.840
But I really love the ramen at Ichiraku

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.760
that Iruka Sensei treats me to even more!

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.340
I hate having to wait three minutes

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.090
after pouring the hot water into the cup.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.170
My future dream is…

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.460
to surpass the Hokage!

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.130
And that's why I'm going to make everyone in the village…

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.340
acknowledge me!

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.920
My name is Sasuke Uchiha.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.630
There are lots of things I hate. And not many things I like.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.880
Also…I have no intention of saying I have a dream,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920
but I do have an ambition.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.960
That is…

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.420
to kill a certain man one day.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.340
I'm Sakura Haruno.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:12.880
What I like…I mean, who I like is…um…

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.920
My future dream is…

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.170
You've already surpassed the Hokage, Naruto.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.510
You're a hero and everyone has acknowledged you.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.300
But becoming Hokage is still your dream.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.460
And Sakura… I bet your feelings for Sasuke

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.010
have changed from what they were back then.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.010
You still love him, but on a totally different level.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.960
He tried to kill you, yet you still care for him.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.880
You won't cut him off, no matter what.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.130
And you think it's your duty to save him from the darkness.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.760
That's how kind you are.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:57.960
Sasuke…

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.920
Your dream was to kill Itachi.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.840
Now that he's gone, what do you desire?

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.550
What are you heading towards?

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.800
I was your teacher,

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.300
but it turned out that I didn't understand you at all.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.550
Even now…

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.340
Sasuke… What is your dream now?

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.300
What's the true meaning behind you saying

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.670
you'll become the Hokage?

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.420
It might be fate

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.960
that reunited the old Team Seven like this, Sasuke.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.840
If you don't want to say what you're thinking right now,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.010
that's fine.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:53.380
But the fact that we were once Team 7 is undisputable…

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.380
Right?

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.800
In front! He's coming!

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.880
You haven't forgotten the lesson

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.800
from the very first mission to steal the bells, have you?

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.590
Yes!

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.210
Of course not!

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.010
The answer is teamwork!

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:36.200
Then dying together can also be considered teamwork, eh?

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.290
Madara…you have both Rinnegan.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.250
His lower body has completely healed.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.580
Obito!

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.750
Unfortunately, Obito is gone.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.660
I've taken over his body now.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:08.700
Seems he was hoping to right his wrongs.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.200
He was praying like a child, deep inside…

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.370
so that he could leave the future to you all.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.500
How convenient that would have been for him, right?

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.160
Just like a spoiled brat.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:39.790
I can't blame her.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.040
Given the power of those eyes.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:59.410
Lady Tsunade, it looks like I finally caught up to them.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.790
I'm not retreating anymore.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.500
I'll be the diversion. So follow me!

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:14.950
Wait!

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.370
Sakura!

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.080
Rule Four!

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.160
A Medic Ninja who masters the Ninja Art of Mitotic Regeneration,

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.200
the 100 Healings, may break the first three rules!

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.370
The same Mitotic Regeneration Jutsu

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.450
as Hashirama's granddaughter.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.620
What?!

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.540
An invisible wall?! I can't reach him!

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.330
What's happening?!

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.540
Sakura…

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.160
Don't worry about me, Naruto.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.450
Sasuke isn't even concerned about me…

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.540
I'm all right, so…

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.620
Naruto!

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.000
Yeah, I know! There are more of them, right?

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.370
That left eye is a Rinnegan!

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.120
Madara's got four shadows now.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.540
Enough with this sideshow.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.540
What is he up to?

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.080
Catastrophic Planetary Devastation!

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.080
Retreat for the time being!

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.500
What about Naruto and the others?!

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.500
They will pull through, no matter what!

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.830
This is Six Paths' power?

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.660
He's way bigger than before and there's more of ‘em…

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.080
Stop getting distracted by what's above!

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.250
His shadows are on the ground with us!

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.450
They're a bit more solid and larger than raindrops, but…

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.450
Here they come!

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.870
The shadows as well!

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.540
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.410
Leave them to me!

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.410
I guess I'll just record their final moments!

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Kurama…

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:42.500
Yeah!

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.450
Susano'o!

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.580
Tailed Beast Bomb Rasen Shuriken!

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.830
Damn it! There's no end to them!

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.200
Unbelievable… Damn you!

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.080
According to that stone tablet.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.580
When the one who possesses the power of the Rinne,

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.370
should draw near the moon…

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.750
the eye that can reflect off of the moon,

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.700
and grant the infinite dream, shall open.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.830
Shine upon the world… Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.400
Where am I? What happened?

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.280
Are you all right, Yamato?

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.950
Lord Third!

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.450
That's right! Kabuto captured me…

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.740
That's happening in the war? What's going on?

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.320
Is Naruto all right?

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.450
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Infinite Tsukuyomi."

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.360
Pull yourself together, Yamato!

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:16.610
THE INFINITE TSUKUYOMI Tune in again!
