WEBVTT

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.570
Die?!

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.500
How come becoming one with nature means dying?

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.100
Gamakichi, what's with the dying?!

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.930
Don't make such weird analogies!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.870
But...

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.730
Relax. You're not actually going to die, Naruto-boy.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.170
Then what?

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.330
Just wait 'til I'm finished...

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.870
I'll explain it stepwise.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.100
Absorbing Nature Energy...

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.330
It means the ability to sense it around you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.670
and draw it into yourself.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.400
In addition, by becoming one with nature,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.700
you also gain full control over the Nature Energy

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.000
entering and leaving your body.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.570
Practically speaking, in terms of your training...

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.500
Yeah, yeah?

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.600
Sit still.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.570
Huh?

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.000
It means sit still!

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.800
When you cease your flow of animal instincts

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.770
and harmonize with the flow of nature,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.130
you will be able to sense Nature Energy for the first time.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.600
So I just stay still?

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.270
That seems easy enough.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.930
Naruto, you really don't get it, do you?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.200
For animals, not moving is the hardest thing to do.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.130
Jumping, running, molding chakra with all my strength...

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.530
I've done those sorts of training.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.370
But staying still? I don't quite get it.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.570
But that's how you take in Nature Energy, right?

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.270
It's impossible to do it right away.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.030
This training requires time,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.830
since the degree of difficulty is very high.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.330
It's gonna take that long?!

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.500
Don't take it so lightly, Naruto-boy!

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.630
Our enemy is Pain, who possesses the Rinnegan...

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.470
The power of the Sage of the Six Paths.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.870
A powerful enemy who killed Jiraiya-boy.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.830
With that kind of attitude, you can't possibly win!

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.530
I know all that!

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.200
Pain is the leader of the Akatsuki, who are after Tailed Beasts.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.530
They could come for me at any moment.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.800
I don't have much time to waste.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.230
Well, it's not as though there isn't a better way...

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.670
There is?!

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.370
Then teach me that!

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.500
This waterfall behind me...

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.100
It's the secret toad oil of Mount Myoboku.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.230
Toad oil?

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.570
Come over here and put out your hand.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.130
Here.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.030
This toad oil has the property of attracting Nature Energy.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.700
It helps with the training.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.470
Hey, that's useful!

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.270
Whenever you rub this oil on your body,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.970
Nature Energy can enter through there.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.530
And gradually, you'll gain the ability to sense Nature Energy.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.300
You're right...

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.830
I think I feel something through my skin.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.000
It is a tool to help grasp the concept.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.630
In time, you won't even need to use the oil.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.230
However, there is a risk.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.100
When used by one who is inexperienced in controlling Nature Energy,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.330
you start to turn into a frog.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.030
Wh-Wh-What the hell is this?!

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.730
Help!

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.970
I don't wanna be a frog!

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.400
Oww!

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.130
What's the big idea?

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.570
I'm back to normal.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.970
It's all about balance.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.870
You're used to turning your Mental and Physical Energy

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.570
into ninjutsu chakra, so you've got a balance there.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.300
But now, you must add Nature Energy into the mix.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.670
Getting the perfect balance is extremely difficult.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.430
Balance, huh?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.500
PHYSICAL MENTAL NATURE Take in too little, and you won't get Sage Jutsu chakra.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.570
And yet, if you take in too much,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.070
Nature Energy will overwhelm you and turn you into a frog.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.400
Of course, if you only take in a little too much, it's reversible.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.270
But get beyond a certain amount, and you'll stay as a frog,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.800
never reverting back to a human again.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.530
What I meant about you having to die

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.270
is that you might stop being human.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.430
Once you turn into a frog,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.400
then you progress further toward permanently becoming one with nature.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.770
And the past students who've failed in this training...

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.700
are those stone statues.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.800
All of them?

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.900
Well, don't fret too much.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.670
You have me.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.030
And this baton beats Nature Energy out of one's body.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.770
If you start transforming into a frog,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.530
I'll beat you thoroughly to reverse it.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.230
Speaking truthfully,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.330
even Jiraiya-boy wasn't able to completely master this.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.130
When molding Sage Jutsu chakra,

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.400
Jiraiya-boy always acquired some frog features.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.700
But he was among the skilled ones.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.070
I doubt that you'd hesitate after coming this far,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.570
but let me ask you...

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.170
What will you do?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.630
I'll do it!

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.470
My Ninja Way...

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.870
is the same as the Pervy Sage's!

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.910
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.000
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.420
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.340
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.140
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.440
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.650
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.280
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:11.910
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.910
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:19.080
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:27.300
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.800
koete Someday...

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.200
The First Challenge

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.470
We finally got the Six-Tails.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.300
Now we can go on the hunt for the Nine-Tails.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.070
Good idea.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.730
Because you killed Jiraiya, the Leaf will set their eyes on you.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.730
The more time passes,

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.270
the more likely they'll set some plan in motion.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.070
Take action before it becomes more difficult.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.630
Pain is invincible...

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.570
No matter what happens, we will capture the Nine-Tails.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.300
There's just one more Tailed Beast left.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.630
Not two?

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.500
Sasuke has already captured the Eight-Tails.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.800
I see.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.500
Konan, make preparations immediately.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.730
We're heading out to the Hidden Leaf.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.900
Oww!

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.500
Tomorrow, I'm going to be bruised and bleeding on the inside.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.200
What? Giving up already?

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.470
Hey, I know a much better training method.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.870
What is it?

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.570
Use Shadow Clones for the training.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.800
They exponentially increase my progress!

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.600
You have a point.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.200
The experience of the Shadow Clones reverts back to the original.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.030
But the reverse is also true...

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.430
If a Shadow Clone completely changes into a frog,

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.670
it's over for the original.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.830
I know that already.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.500
Very well. But four is the limit!

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.570
Any more and neither the baton or I can keep up!

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.570
All right!

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.770
We're not playing a game of whack-a-mole!

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.130
This is training!

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.930
I'm not gonna last doing this!

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.470
Damn!

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.100
Oww!

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.530
My face is like this from being hit!

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.630
I'm not turning into a frog!

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.430
What?! Sorry.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.370
I never thought that training to feel Nature Energy

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.900
would be so hard.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.530
Only through perseverance shall true strength be gained.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.470
I know that!

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.270
If it'll make me strong like the Pervy Sage,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.300
anyone would endure this.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.470
No... That's impossible.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.600
This training is not for everyone...

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:36.100
You could say it's only possible because it's you and Jiraiya-boy.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.130
Or else I wouldn't have even brought you here.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.600
What do you mean?

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.170
Unless you already possess enormous chakra inside you,

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.930
Nature Energy would just take over you right away.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.370
That is how intense Nature Energy is.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.370
Plus, they must have the guts to never give up.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.770
That's the kind of person who can become a Sage.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.470
All right! Let's do this then!

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.900
Fool! Do you want to kill yourself?!

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.670
I can see it!

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.830
- Yes! - It seems he's starting

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.130
- I can see it! I can see it! - to get the feel of Nature Energy.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.570
- Lord Fukasaku, I'm getting a little hungry. - I saw it! I saw it!

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.970
- You're right. - I saw it!

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.900
- Naruto-boy, time for a break. - I'm awesome, yeah!

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:54.970
Let's eat.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.230
Eat up now.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.900
After the break,

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.800
I'll have you try to lift up the stone frogs using Sage Jutsu.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.330
Y-Yes sir!

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:11.570
Good, huh? They're Ma's special dishes.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.170
They're all favorites of mine.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.330
That actually tasted quite good.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.870
I'm becoming less human, after all.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.000
Now then, I want you to raise the stone frog.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.770
But first, try it using only your ninjutsu chakra.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.100
O-Okay.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:36.970
All right!

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.800
I can't lift it!

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.400
All right, stop!

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.000
Now, mold some Sage Jutsu chakra!

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:52.900
Right!

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.370
Good! Now try lifting the stone frog once more!

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.070
Okay!

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.770
Oh!

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.670
That's it! Naruto-boy!

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.570
Nice, Naruto!

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.070
This lad's quicker on the uptake than Jiraiya-boy.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.870
I did it!

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.500
Fool! How dare you treat your predecessor with such disrespect!

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.130
Though he's a lot denser than Jiraiya-boy too...

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.330
All right, Naruto-boy!

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.200
Now put all the toppled stones back in place!

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.100
Are you serious?!

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.130
The Eight-Tails, huh?

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.300
It seems Sasuke was successful.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.200
Pain will bring the Nine-Tails.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:45.330
It appears you've mastered toad oil assisted control.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.130
Now you need to master controlling Nature Energy

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.330
without using the oil.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.300
I can feel the power flowing into me!

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.000
Ninjutsu chakra consumes your internal energy.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.670
The more you use it, the more exhausted you will become.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.370
In contrast, Sage Jutsu chakra draws in external energy,

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.330
so it will not tire you.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.800
In fact, you will recover and heal quicker too.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.130
I get it...

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.670
Well... With the Nine-Tails' chakra in the mix too,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.830
he's showing a truly remarkable recovery rate.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.670
Now maybe I can do that too...

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:29.930
Do what?

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.870
Huh?! Oh, nothing... Nothing at all!

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.070
Never mind then... But here.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.130
I thought I'd give you this today, Naruto-boy.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.070
What is it?

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:43.430
A book.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.330
Book?

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:48.600
This is the first novel Jiraiya-boy wrote.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.730
A lot of Jiraiya-boy's mind and heart are contained within it.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.670
You should read it.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.300
TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA Tales of...a Gutsy Ninja.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.430
Why don't you give it up?

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.370
This game of tag is getting boring.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.600
Give it up.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.430
Can I say one thing?

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.770
I don't care to listen!

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:38.400
Die already!

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.830
Give up...

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.500
on me giving up!

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.100
Even if you bring me down,

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.030
another assassin will attack the village...

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.730
As long as we are cursed to live in this Ninja World,

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.830
there will be no peace.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.330
Then...I'll break that curse!

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:13.200
If there is such a thing as peace, I'll seize it!

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.000
I'll never give up!

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.570
Wh-Who are you...?

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.500
My name is...

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:26.870
TALES OF A GUTSY NINJA

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.500
JIRAIYA

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.500
Sasuke said he was going to sever his bond with me

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:48.900
and become stronger.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.270
He said I could never understand his feelings.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.300
You were friends with Orochimaru long ago, right, Pervy Sage?

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.330
Why did Orochimaru desert the village

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.270
and decide to destroy the Hidden Leaf?

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:11.430
Orochimaru changed after his parents were killed.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.030
He became obsessed with the Forbidden Jutsu.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.100
Maybe he longed to see his parents...

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.430
Or he sought revenge on the Leaf Village,

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.370
who he held responsible for their deaths.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.770
My parents weren't killed.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.270
So like you,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.070
I was accused of not being able to understand.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.170
Perhaps he was right,

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.370
and I didn't understand a thing about him...

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.870
However...

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.800
Even I can see there's too much hate in our Ninja World.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.870
Hate?

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.900
And I've wanted to do something about this hatred,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.270
yet I'm not sure what must be done.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:06.100
But I have faith... that there will come a time

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.770
when people can truly understand one another.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.400
It all sounds kinda complicated.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.330
And if I can't find the answer,

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.630
perhaps I will entrust you to find it.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.800
Yes, sir! I can't turn you down, can I, Pervy Sage?

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.700
What? Why are you laughing?

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.670
Your smile is my salvation.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.700
I'm glad I made you my student.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.370
R-Really?

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.500
But I haven't given up yet.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.670
PRODUCTION NOTEBOOK I plan to change this world with my books!

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.200
With those books that don't sell?

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.670
You fool!

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.370
They'll be bestsellers before you know it!

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.130
And when that day finally arrives,

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.170
I won't autograph your copies even if you beg me!

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.730
I don't need any of that!

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.400
I don't need any of that...

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.630
'Cuz Pervy Sage... You gave me something much more valuable.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.670
With so few people, it sure is taking a while.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.900
Shut up!

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.970
Be quiet and focus.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.930
It appears... Sasuke has blundered.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.570
An octopus leg!

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.670
Quit laughing!

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.500
What's this sensation?

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.770
I don't feel uncomfortable being still at all!

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.730
Is this what it feels like to become one with nature?

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.330
I'm not using the toad oil,

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.970
but I can tell power is being gathered from everywhere!

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.200
I can feel the power surging inside of me!

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.030
Is this Sage Mode?!

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.800
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Surpassing the Master"

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:08.430
Tune in again!
