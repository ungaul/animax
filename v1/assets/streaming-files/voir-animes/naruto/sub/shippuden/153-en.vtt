WEBVTT

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.570
Boss!

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.930
No, no!

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.230
Stop!

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.870
Huh?

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.200
What's wrong? I was just about to start!

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.170
This is terrible!

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.300
It seems Lord Danzo has died!

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.000
He's not the Sixth Hokage anymore!

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.330
Not anymore!

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.270
What are you saying?

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.500
I've prepared and I've studied Lord Danzo's face so well

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.330
I even see him in my dreams!

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.530
Damn… What the heck?!

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.400
So… Who's going to be the next Hokage?

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.500
INTEL DIVISION She originally worked for Orochimaru

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.530
before she joined up with Sasuke as a shinobi for the Akatsuki.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.770
That means she knows a lot.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.130
You better treat me well.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.470
And…

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.870
It looks like she was there when Sasuke and Danzo battled it out.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.770
You saw them fighting?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.970
You're interrogating me here?

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.270
Okay, we'll hold her at the Intel Division.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.270
We'll get everything she knows.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.270
Take her away.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.200
Yes, sir.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.570
Hey…no! I won't try to escape.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.600
So let go of me, will you?!

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.730
Jeez!

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.330
I'm so thirsty, give me something to drink!

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.470
By the way, how's Lady Tsunade doing?

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.330
She's still unconscious.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.130
I see.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.770
Well, I'll go make my report to the superiors.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.730
Excuse me.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.330
Kakashi…

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.400
The chain of command in the Hidden Leaf Village

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.900
is in shambles.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.330
Someone has to restore order as soon as possible.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.300
Yeah… I know that.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.900
Kakashi Hatake, the Hokage

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.200
Sasuke did that?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.030
It's an unbelievable situation.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.200
That's why I want you to let me handle Sasuke.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.970
You'll take on Sasuke alone?!

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.770
How can you expect us to agree to that?

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.570
Tenten is right, Naruto.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.670
We can't just give in to your stubbornness.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.200
The reason is because this is a big problem for the village.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.530
I'm not being stubborn.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.270
You said you'd give us the details when we got home,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.000
but I never thought this is what you'd say!

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.100
We've all made up our minds to kill Sasuke!

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.700
Hey Naruto, don't tell me you're saying

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.700
you'll get Sasuke all by yourself,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.930
when you're actually planning to protect him.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.630
No, I have no intention of protecting Sasuke.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.500
– Chidori! – Rasengan!

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.800
After all that fighting at the Five Kage Summit,

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.630
and fighting Danzo…

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.830
If Sasuke was weakened at that time,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.000
why didn't you take him out right then?

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.000
Madara was there too!

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.300
It didn't seem so easy.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.670
Besides…

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.300
That's no reason to let him get away so easily!

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.400
Hey Naruto… You're strong.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.330
You're the hero who took down Pain, aren't you?!

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.030
Hero?

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.400
Yeah. You could take Sasuke down like you did back then.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.830
That's not true.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.370
Huh?

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.100
I wouldn't be able to beat Sasuke with something like that now.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.700
That's what I found out.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.130
Inside him…

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.730
What is it that you found out?

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.870
In any case, nobody should take on Sasuke as he is now.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.800
What do you mean?

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.600
I'm the only one who can fight him.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.430
That's what I mean.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.070
That doesn't tell us anything!

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.430
Explain it in detail. What happened?

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.130
I said I'd tell you when the time comes.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.900
Hey! There you go again! Giving us the runaround!

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.270
Damn it.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.800
Naruto…

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.600
Sasuke…

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.000
Were you able to read…

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.570
what was inside of my heart?

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.700
And you saw it, didn't you?

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.700
That if you and I fight…

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.230
we will both die.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.370
What are you hiding?

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.670
Well… Please leave it to me.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.000
Hey! Naruto!

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400
Naruto…

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.000
Hey, Naruto!

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.700
Danzo too?

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.100
Such a shame. The best ones go first.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.230
We must quickly hold a meeting

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.230
to determine who will be the next Hokage.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.570
The Allied Shinobi Force will be stalled

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.000
if the Hokage is missing.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.800
That cannot be helped.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.470
We will recommend you for Hokage.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.900
The Sand, a member of the alliance,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.370
has also recommended you.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.000
I am prepared for it.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.870
Oh… That was easy.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.500
Of course, it would be a little out of character for me

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.030
to be the Hokage.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.030
That's fine.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.400
I will go to the Feudal Lords to request a conference.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.600
Go back to the village and prepare until you are called.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.070
There really isn't anything for me to prepare.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.870
Listen, Kakashi.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.070
Let me just say one thing to the next Hokage.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.300
It is true that Danzo was very ambitious,

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.600
but everything he did was for the sake of the village.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.030
Hiruzen out front and Danzo in the back.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.030
Things went most smoothly in Hidden Leaf back then.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.600
Is that meant to be some sort of excuse?

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.470
Just some advice.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.630
Don't try to take on everything by yourself.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.100
It would be best to have a confidant beside you.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.370
We are the only ones remaining from the old days.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.630
There is no telling what the fate of the shinobi will be.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.700
Sensei… They say I am going to be the next Hokage.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.330
Yo! Kakashi!

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.130
Looks like you got home safely.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.570
How are you?

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.100
You weren't injured, were you?

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.930
Oh, I'm fine.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.900
Okay, in that case…

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.430
It's been a while, so why don't we have a match?

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.200
Why?!

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.530
Why? What do you mean?

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.900
Because you and I are eternal rivals, that's why!

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.330
We've had over 100 matches up till now.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.830
Let's add another one!

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.830
In that case… No using the Sharingan now.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.830
– Rock, paper, scissors! – Rock, paper, scissors!

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.800
No!

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.130
Not that! I don't want Rock Paper Scissors!

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.100
Our challenge will be…that!

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.270
I've set up a goal up there.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.200
We'll race to there.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.330
This is not the time for…

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:03.830
That's exactly why I want to have a hot challenge.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.100
You'll accept it, won't you, my eternal rival?!

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.130
You're right. No time like the present I guess.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.330
All right! Let's do it!

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.970
What? You want to start way out at the entrance to the village?

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.500
I want to enjoy this challenge to the fullest.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.470
Are you ready?

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.230
Anytime…

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.830
– Start! – Start!

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.970
Ouch…

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.100
When did you get those things?!

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.930
Oh, before we started. From a pile of rubble.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.300
That's not fair.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.200
Take that!

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.830
What?

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.470
Take that!

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.370
Ouch!

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.600
Are you thinking about Naruto?

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.500
Yeah…

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.730
Forget it. I don't think it'll do any good.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.900
Won't do any good?

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.500
If Naruto doesn't talk, we won't find out anything.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.600
Here.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.830
I guess.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.570
What was that?

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.430
Has something happened?

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.570
With the village being reconstructed,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.430
the roads are all different and I can't tell where we're going!

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.000
Seems like it!

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.270
What is that?

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.870
Listen, I don't think anyone will be satisfied

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.470
with the way things stand.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.930
What are you talking about?

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:56.930
About Sasuke…

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.270
Are you satisfied, Sakura?

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.070
I think you have some sort of plan, so…

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.730
I'm putting my faith in you!

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.370
Is that Kakashi Sensei and Guy Sensei?!

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.900
So fast!

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.470
Those two… Don't tell me they're at it again?!

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.530
No mistake about it. It's their rivalry contest.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.000
Guy Sensei probably challenged him.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.730
Of all the times to do this.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.000
No, that's exactly why he challenged him now.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.770
Huh?! Why?

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.000
As expected from my rival!

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.900
The challenge has just begun!

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.100
Yeah!

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.730
While Guy Sensei is battling it out, I will fight too!

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.530
Lee, who won?

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.400
Kakashi Sensei is… the winner!

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.400
That was a pretty good challenge.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.800
Congratulations!

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.300
Oh no… This is nothing to be congratulated for.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.000
Congratulations on becoming the next Hokage!

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.900
When you become the Hokage,

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.200
you probably won't be able to accept my challenges so easily.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.970
That's why I wanted to challenge you for the last time

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.200
before it happened.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.900
Thank you, Kakashi.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.870
This isn't the last time.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.470
We'll still be eternal rivals. That won't change.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:22.830
Huh?!

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.670
Guy, seriously, I find it reassuring having you there.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.900
I hope I can count on your continued support.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.500
Ka-Kakashi…

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.170
I can't bring this whole village

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.470
– together by myself. – You're making me cry.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.430
– Hey are you listening? Hey! Hey! – I'm listening.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.770
You're Kakashi Hatake, aren't you? The next Hokage?

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.300
Yes, well…

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.500
Oh, this is perfect! Let me measure your face!

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.200
I want to get a mold too.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.800
W-What is this?

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.730
It's for the Great Stone Faces. The Stone Faces of the Hokage!

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.130
I need you to come with me.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.200
J-Just a minute.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.270
It seems it's not easy being the Hokage.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:13.230
I guess I've been one-upped by my eternal rival.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:19.100
However… Yes! Now it is your turn to pass him.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.970
If Kakashi is to become the Hokage, I will aim beyond that!

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.730
I will go beyond Hokage, far and beyond!

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.930
Good luck, Sensei!

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.070
Thanks!

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.200
By the way, what is beyond the Hokage?

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.070
I wonder what it is.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.030
This hairstyle is okay, right?

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.530
Umm… The headband should be at an angle.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.730
You don't have to be exact.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.500
You must be joking.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.500
Once it's carved, it can't be changed easily.

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:07.630
I see.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.570
That's it! We haven't missed anything, have we?

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.870
No, sir!

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.430
Then let's get ready to make the mold.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.700
Got it!

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.570
Is that plaster?

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.900
That's right.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.900
We'll paint this on you in thin layers

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.770
to make a mold of your face!

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.200
I want to start right away, but you'll have to take that off.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.300
What?!

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.200
That mask.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.200
Your Stone Face won't look good if you're hiding your face.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.970
Somebody! Somebody, come quickly! Please!

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.030
What's happened?

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.130
Shizune… Don't tell me…

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.670
Thanks for accepting.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.030
I would feel a lot better

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.170
if you would become the Hokage, Shikaku.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:11.730
Don't be ridiculous.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.000
I'm old enough to retire and have my son take over.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.070
Of course, I'm in no position to do that.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.530
Yes.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:25.130
To think that Danzo fell to the Akatsuki.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:26.470
Yes.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.530
We must decide on another Hokage.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.470
We are all recommending Kakashi Hatake.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.370
Oh, that man?

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.130
Kakashi Hatake, enter.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.870
Oh… Seems like a good choice.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.900
All right. Now then, Kakashi Hatake, I appoint you…

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.870
I appoint you…

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.730
My lord, what is wrong?

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:09.570
Oh, well… What number Hokage do I appoint him?

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.600
What number?

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.900
Danzo was appointed Number Six,

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.530
but he died before he formally assumed the office.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:23.670
I don't know if Kakashi should be Number Six or Number Seven.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.070
Even if Danzo had not formally assumed the office…

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.300
A missing number?

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.900
He should be Number Six.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.700
No, I think Number Seven.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.800
But Number Six never really…

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.670
All right. Kakashi Hatake! You will be…

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.230
Please excuse me!

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:52.900
Guy?

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.500
What is this?! We are in an important conference.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.730
I have come to report a sudden change in the state of affairs!

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.170
What? A sudden change?!

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.030
Lady Tsunade!

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.130
Shizune…you're hurting me.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.970
Send messages to the other villages!

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.000
Tsunade, the Hokage of Hidden Leaf Village,

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.300
is alive and well!

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.670
Report this to the Feudal Lords of the other lands as well.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.800
We should let the people of our village know at once.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.030
I will leave that to you.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.170
Umm… Well…

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.470
May I go home?

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.230
Since we're here now,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.130
why don't we go and eat at that sushi boat restaurant?

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.270
Let's see who can eat the most!

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.000
Boss!

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.500
It's no good! Stop!

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.100
What happened?

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.930
They say Lady Tsunade has been reinstated as the Hokage.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:03.800
You gotta be kidding me! I wasted my time again!

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.970
It was indeed I who summoned you.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.170
Who're you again?

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.130
C'mon, could you remember my name already?

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.070
That's right!

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.370
That's right! I have seen a prophecy involving you.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.500
Listen carefully.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.870
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Prophecy of the Great Lord Elder"

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.400
It's all clear to me now.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:11.000
Tune in again!
