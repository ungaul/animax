WEBVTT

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.370
Gimme a break... I wouldn't have thought that

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.130
my Self-Destructing Clone would be eaten away too...

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.800
I'll show you my ultimate work of art...

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.500
Art is explosive!

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.870
I somehow made it in time...

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.270
Then again, I managed to flee because that acted as a diversion...

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.130
My arm's getting sucked into space...?!

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.830
What a Jutsu!

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.430
What I lost was... only up to about my elbow.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.500
I must search for my right arm and ring...

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.270
So this is Sasori's true form, huh...

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.500
Here it is!

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.430
Zetsu, here it is!

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.970
I wonder if I can now become a member of the Akatsuki...

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.800
One slot has opened up after all...

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.630
You idiot... It ain't that easy...

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.230
Oh come on, why don't you just let him join...

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.470
Tobi's a great kid...

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.130
Let's go.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.930
Give me a sec, Zetsu!

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.370
I'm sure... It's around here somewhere.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.870
Uh, hey, Zetsu!

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.000
Wait, please! Zetsu...

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.930
Return of the Kazekage 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:44.870
How much longer?

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.530
They'll be in sight soon!

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.170
Gaara...

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.370
That's...

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.300
Heh...what a lavish welcome.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.770
Awesome...!

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.730
There are so many people...!

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.530
Just as would be expected for the Kazekage... Yeah...

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.670
I'm so glad you're safe...

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.600
It's thanks to everyone...

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.670
Naruto Uzumaki, I am truly grateful!

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.530
No, I... I really wasn't able to do anything.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.370
Lord Kazekage, the villagers are waiting for you.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.270
Right this way...

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.330
Well, shall we go?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.470
Wait.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.300
First...

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:06.900
You're right...

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.770
Let us pray that Granny Chiyo's soul rests in peace.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.470
A moment of silent prayer...

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200
Big Sister...

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.670
We're home...

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.770
Huh, are you leaving already?

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.070
You should stay a little longer...

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.500
That's right. At least another day... until you've rested up.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.630
I'd love to do that, but...

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.270
There's something I must report to my Master, the Hokage, immediately...

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.100
I see...

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.100
And if the Akatsuki have begun to attack villages,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.030
I feel uneasy being away from the Leaf Village too.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.630
That's why you want to get back as soon as possible, right...

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.700
Yes, that's exactly right.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.170
But in that physical condition...

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.870
Not to worry... I have comrades I can rely on.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.970
Yeah! Leave it to me!

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.100
By the way, we have already sent the first report out through Takamaru,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.000
but there's nothing written

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.270
as to whether the two Akatsuki members are dead or alive...

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.500
Shouldn't you inform your village about it?

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.970
I'll report that directly to the Hokage.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.270
There are other things I'm concerned about too...

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.900
Granny Chiyo from the Hidden Sand Village is the only casualty,

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.100
and the Kazekage has returned home safely.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.770
Guy's unit and Kakashi's unit have completed their missions.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.230
They anticipate returning to the Leaf Village in three days' time.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.000
All right.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.330
Uh... Lady Tsunade...

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.570
What is it?

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:41.330
The last mission went well. But as Master Jiraiya stated...

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.030
sending Naruto, a Jinchuriki,

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.230
into a place where there are people targeting the Tailed Beasts...

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.870
I question the wisdom of that...

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.430
It's true that former Black Ops Unit member Kakashi is accompanying him,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.530
but why take such a high risk by sending Naruto?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.570
It's for the very reason that he's a Jinchuriki.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.700
The only people who can really understand Jinchuriki

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.200
are those who are Jinchuriki themselves.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.170
Besides...that guy has a mysterious power...

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.930
Everyone starts wanting to place their bets on him.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:26.870
So that's...

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.670
Granny Chiyo's grave.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.630
CHIYO

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.270
She said she didn't want a grave.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.800
But I thought it would be better to have one.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.100
I felt that everyone needed a place to gather...

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.030
Everybody, say your farewells...

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.200
Okay.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.200
Let's go.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.030
Okay...

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.800
Sakura, Naruto... It's about time to depart.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.100
Okay!

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.000
Let's go, Sakura.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.830
Granny Chiyo, thank you...

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.130
See you... Uh... yeah...

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:48.000
Normally I suppose people shake hands and say goodbye...

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.070
but I'm not really good with that kind of stuff, so I'll just leave it at this...

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.300
Sensei! You guys are too slow!

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.600
Uh... I'm sorry, Guy.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.470
When I use that new Sharingan,

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.670
it takes a toll on my body for quite a while...

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.200
Hurry!

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.470
H-Hey...!

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:00.830
Huh?

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.300
What is it?

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.270
That's...kinda disgusting...

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.670
Old men giving each other a piggyback...

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.330
That's more sickening than I imagined.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.000
Oh man... That's annoying...

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:25.130
I see! It's training, isn't it!

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.230
Now this way, it'll be faster!

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.630
Move, move, move!

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.000
You guys... You think you can keep up with me?!

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.770
And when movement gets thrown in, it's even more sickening.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.300
- Neji... - I refuse!

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.600
It looks like Deidara was done in too...

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.700
There's no question that his cause of death is from an explosion...

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.070
Don't you agree, Zetsu?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.870
He's probably laying there dead somewhere around there...

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.800
Get your hands off, you jerk...

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.430
Hey! He's alive!

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.700
What happened to the Jinchuriki?

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.930
I've met my quota...

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.900
Oh dear, oh my... You barely made it, Deidara...

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.370
You all right? Guess not.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.330
Tobi, even the patience of a saint has limits...

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.100
Try saying something again and I'll decide your cause of death myself...

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.130
No doubt it'll be death from explosion.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.500
That's...past the limit...

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.730
Death from suffocation...

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.570
I've already pulled some strings from behind...

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.830
So that you'll be posted with Kakashi's squad.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.770
Not only are you close in age with Naruto Uzumaki,

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.900
but you are also stronger than anyone in the village of the same generation...

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:29.730
And more than anything, I admire your superb talent for painting...

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.670
From today until the completion of this mission...

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.130
Your name is...Sai.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.600
Sai. Right...

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.500
Don't put on a fake smile like that in front of me.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:51.570
I'm sorry...

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.930
It said in the textbook that in order to charm people,

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.300
you first have to be able to smile.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.200
I've been practicing, but...

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.570
I still have difficulty in creating facial expressions.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.700
According to information I've acquired,

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.100
Sasori is to meet with a spy he sent to Orochimaru

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.700
at Tenchi Bridge in the Village Hidden in the Grass ten days from today.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.530
I see... A clue to Orochimaru's whereabouts?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.770
Lady Tsunade, please allow us to continue on with this mission.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.470
But this information itself may be a trap to lure you in.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.600
That doesn't matter.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.330
If it is a trap, I'll fight with all my might.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.600
Next time: "The New Target"
