WEBVTT

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.370
Let's get to it and silence this irritating rapper.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.500
I intend to.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.630
It's not irritating...

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.530
It's cool rhythms and rhymes. You fool! Ah! Yeah!!

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.000
He's really...irritating!

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.900
He's got zero rapping talent!

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.030
What?! You fool! You jerk!

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.100
Will you shut up?!

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.930
The pain in my chest, baby! Is like from your kicking, yo! You're not running now, come on! We're settling this score 'til I'm kicking, YEAH!

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.670
RHYME NOTES

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.370
I'm feeling good right now.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.970
Just came up with the greatest rhyme.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.000
Thank you.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.030
That's why I'll play with you... You foolish baby!

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.370
Watch out, Sasuke! This guy's used to handling blades!

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.000
He's no ordinary ninja!

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.800
I'll give you a taste of my hook.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.300
The Eight-Tails vs. Sasuke

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.530
Wha--?

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.830
What's with that stance?

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.170
Sasuke! Are you all right?!

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.200
What's with those moves?

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.830
I can't read through his line of attack.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.900
Chidori?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.300
He plans to use his indefensible Chidori Blade!

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.670
What?! He countered it?!

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.130
He can stream his chakra too?!

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.400
Float... Float like a butterfly...!

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.370
Eight-Tails! Sting like a bee!

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.870
Sasuke!

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.700
And this is the finishing sting!

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.230
He also uses... Lightning Style, which is my weakness.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.630
Sasuke!

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.600
Sasuke!

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.200
This is bad...

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.470
Here, Sasuke... Hurry up and bite me!

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.030
Do it now!

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.830
He funneled the Lightning Style through his body

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.900
and shifted the course of my attack.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.000
He avoided a fatal injury...

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.530
And...that woman possesses the ability

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.100
to heal others by letting them suck her chakra.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.230
Thanks, Karin.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.800
Sure... Sasuke! Let's do this together!

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.300
The fact is this guy is super strong.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.100
We should go at him as if we are trying to kill him, instead of not.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.730
That way we can probably take him down without killing him.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.870
Looks like this battle is gonna drag on...

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.730
Check it out, yo!

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.300
Got you!

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.430
Sasuke, now! Just do the both of us!

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.570
Chidori!

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.870
Gone! Where is he?

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.500
So weak, yet so persistent...

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.730
I'm done playing, now go home for some drinking! Yeah!

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.470
- Karin! - I know...

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.630
Over there!

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.570
That woman's also a sensory-type, eh?

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.700
Can't be helped... Going with the eighth tail.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.430
Here it comes... It's the same as back then.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.000
Hmm... He's the first to dodge my eight-tails form

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.300
since my brother.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.300
Damn, he's going after the others!

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.300
First, you guys will be torn apart!

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.170
Are you all right?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.970
Yeah...more or less...

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.430
He definitely has speed and power.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.370
But he only moves in a linear fashion.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.630
My eyes should be able to make them out.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:15.170
Karin! Read his chakra and predict his movements!

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.400
Stay on him and keep me informed of his location at all times!

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.100
That's if you can really keep up!

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.700
Sasuke!

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.470
Those eyes... The Sharingan! Is this genjutsu?

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.770
I can't move my body.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.530
Lariat!

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.400
Sasuke!

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:12.470
Wha--?!

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.100
What is this?

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.270
His neck and chest portion have been blown off, organs and all.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.730
He's beyond our...

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.470
He is like my reincarnation.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.170
Hang in there!

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.770
Karin, it's all right. I'll do it.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.330
The chakra you have now can't deal with it.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.770
What do you intend to do?

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.200
I'll distribute my body and chakra to Sasuke by merging with him.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.600
Since his body was compatible with my curse mark, it should work.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.470
In order to release the genjutsu,

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.730
I need a partner to disturb my chakra and awaken me.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.200
My partner is the Eight-Tails inside me.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.970
A genjutsu has no effect on the Jinchuriki host,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.570
which controls a Tailed Beast.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.970
Your illusions I obliterate, then you all I shall annihilate.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.700
My true form of the Jinchuriki...

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.070
It's a monster, so watch it now,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.070
Host Transformation, yeah...

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.070
Eight-Tails will pee your pants, you lil' ants!

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.570
Such chakra... Is this even possible?

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.270
That's the Eight-Tails?

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.930
An ox-octopus monster... That's his true form?

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.400
To spear my foes, my glorious longhorns!

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.830
His chakra is off the scale...

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.330
We'll die if we stay here!

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.200
Jugo, are you done yet?!

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.430
Thank goodness... Sasuke...

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.000
You're conscious. Come on, get up!

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.030
All right, Jugo... Huh?!

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.170
He turned into a child?! Why?!

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.470
Jugo...

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.330
I won't let you die...

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.730
You're a memento of Kimimaro.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.800
Come on! Hurry! We gotta run!

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.470
A Water-Style ninja... I knew it.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.470
You have the advantage of the terrain!

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.300
I'll take over from here!

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.470
Run while you can!

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.300
Suigetsu... Let's go, Sasuke.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.300
Heh. Who would've thought...

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.400
that I'd end up sacrificing myself to save their hides this often?

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.670
As if I'd let you get away after what you've done, you fool, you jerk!

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.400
Th-That really doesn't look good.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.670
Could that be Lord Killer Bee's?!

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.470
Wh-What is it, Senpai?!

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.400
- Let's go! - Yes, sir!

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.870
Th-That's...!

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.170
Lord Killer Bee...

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.400
Why has he transformed into the Eight-Tails?!

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.200
And after all that lecturing from Lord Raikage...

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.370
Look closely! He's battling someone!

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:32.930
Those robes...

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.230
Are they the Akatsuki?

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.400
The ones who kidnapped Yugito?

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.400
Suigetsu is wasted... Damn it!

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.300
We can't get away... What'll we do?!

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.170
Here, Sasuke. Hurry up and bite me!

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.070
I won't let you die...

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.670
You're a memento of Kimimaro.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:18.200
I'll take over from here! Run while you can!

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.170
He's coming!

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:32.600
Amaterasu!

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
S-So those are the inextinguishable black flames Sasuke spoke of!

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.730
A-Awesome!

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.030
Karin, run!

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.670
Damn! The black flames!

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.230
It's too late for Karin.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.970
We need to get away before we get caught too!

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.800
- Wait, Jugo. - No!

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.370
Karin!

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.730
Wh-What?

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.570
Jugo! Get Karin! Hurry!

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.430
The black flames are extinguished...

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.300
What's going on, Sasuke?

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.800
I was able to extinguish the black flames of Amaterasu.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.700
Are these the visual powers of my Mangekyo Sharingan?!

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.770
In which case...

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.530
The Eight-Tails... It seems he's barely alive.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.570
Then...we managed to take down the Eight-Tails without killing him.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.970
Let's grab him and go.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.370
No way... Lord Killer Bee has been defeated?

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.070
I-It must be some mistake...

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.530
Shall we rescue him?

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.330
They're Akatsuki members. Don't be hasty.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.930
Huh?! That's... What is it?!

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.430
The Uchiha crest!

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:24.730
Uchiha?

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:29.500
Rather than taking action ourselves, we'd better get word to Lord Raikage!

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.300
If he hears what happened to his younger brother...

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.730
Knowing Lord Raikage, he won't be pleased at all.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.330
You seem quite affected, physically.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.130
Especially since, in addition to losing Orochimaru's curse mark,

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.630
you haven't quite healed from your battle against Itachi.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.170
Yeah...

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.470
Though I really didn't expect we'd have such a fight on our hands.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.930
But now...

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.000
I've been waiting for you all.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.270
Lady Katsuyu! What are you doing here?

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.530
It's an emergency.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.070
The barrier to Mount Katsuragi has been broken!

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.430
What?! Of the Tsuchigumo clan?

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.470
Time is of essence.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.000
Under the secret treaty made by the Third Hokage,

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.470
Team Seven will immediately head out to the location

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.630
with Yamato as team captain.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.530
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Wanderer"

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.270
It's an all-new mission!

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.730
Tune in again!
