WEBVTT

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.670
Ow!

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.770
Owww... Focus!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.830
Though it's just a little, your body is moving!

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.470
Don't forget, "stay still"!

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.430
Doing this without using the oil is a lot harder than I thought.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.500
Of course it is!

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.870
Don't expect it'll be so easy when you don't use the oil!

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.930
Not even the slightest quiver!

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.100
Say, I was just thinking... What is it?

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.770
Why can't I just take this oil with me when I fight?

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.100
Then I won't need to learn

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.630
how to take in Nature Energy without the oil.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.600
That is impossible.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.430
Huh? Why?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.200
Outside of Mount Myoboku's climate, this oil vaporizes immediately.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.530
No kidding?!

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.230
I thought I told you.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.830
The oil is only to help you grasp the concept.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.200
Yes, sir!

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.530
But the way you change into a frog so quickly...

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.130
Naruto-boy, you lack concentration!

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.430
You're not taking it seriously enough!

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.000
No, that's not true.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.100
After all, I did get the knack of this thing from the previous training.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.630
Enough! Just follow me!

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.830
Hey... This isn't what I'm thinking, is it?

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.870
It's exactly that. This is your next training site.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.900
Stack a stone slab atop that summit and begin Zen meditation.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.630
If your concentration wavers and you move even slightly,

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.400
you will fall to the bottom of the ravine.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.570
F-From up there?

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.470
Hmm... This should do.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.130
Follow me, Naruto-boy!

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.970
Stay still!

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.470
You must learn to stop your motion as an animal.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.730
Find your own center of balance,

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.470
and motionlessly synchronize with nature!

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.930
S-Saved.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.700
Taking in Nature Energy will have to wait

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.700
until you first perfect staying still.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.000
No way!

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.100
Oww...

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.970
Maybe it's time for a break.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.970
Damn...

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.500
It's this hard just to stay still...

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.630
Isn't this training sorta ridiculous?

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.700
Such nonsense!

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.470
Your master, Jiraiya-boy, managed this feat.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.470
Huh? Don't tell me... Pervy Sage trained here too?

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.370
Yes. He and I came here often.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.830
Thank you, Lord Fukasaku!

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.000
Say Jiraiya-boy, how about we call it a day?

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.700
Nah! I can still keep on going.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.430
But...

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.700
I think I'm on the verge of grasping it...

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.630
So can you help me for a while longer?

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.870
I must say, he had more guts than anybody else around.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.500
Say, how long did Pervy Sage take on this training?

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.600
Well, Jiraiya-boy came here to train between missions,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.500
so it took him some time...

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.970
I see.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.800
Naruto-boy?

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.800
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.630
I don't have the luxury of time.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.930
So I have to pick up the pace!

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.800
Pervy Sage did the same training!

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.670
So I've gotta do my best too!

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.010
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.100
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.520
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.440
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.240
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.540
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.750
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.380
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:05:51.780 --> 00:06:02.010
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.010
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.180
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.400
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.900
koete Someday...

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.570
Surpassing the Master

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.400
It's no good...

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.800
Focus, Naruto-boy!

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.130
That's pretty colorful and yummy looking.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.970
Oh, would you like one, Naruto-boy?

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.630
It's my favorite, larva riceballs.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.970
No thanks!

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.830
Oh no!

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.700
Oh...

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.900
It's looking good. He's rapidly amassing Nature Energy.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.370
He's finally got it!

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.070
I'm impressed at how far he's gotten without using the oil.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.870
He's displaying the rings around the eyes. Proof of Sagehood.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.470
And no frog aspects either!

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.070
This might mean Naruto-boy has become a Sage,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.100
surpassing Jiraiya-boy!

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.770
And it seems he's able to build up

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.130
even more Sage Jutsu chakra than when he was using the oil.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.430
How does it feel?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.230
Hmm... Now I kinda get what it means to become one with nature.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:47.030
Owwww... Huh? It doesn't hurt that much...

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.400
And that is Sage Mode!

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.730
Your body has been activated on many levels.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.070
W-Wow! Sage Mode, huh?!

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.930
Now that you've mastered Sage Mode,

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.630
we've come to the final step.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.770
What?! Final step? You mean there's more?!

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.570
It's a type of sparring

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.670
that Sages perform using Sage Jutsu chakra.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.570
Now I shall teach you how to do Frog Kumite!

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.570
You are so useless!

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.400
Why'd you leave behind my Executioner's Blade?!

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.200
Shut up, Suigetsu!

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.130
Just be thankful we didn't leave you behind!

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.200
Look who's talking! You were also passed out, Karin!

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.130
I got knocked out trying to protect you guys!

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.430
It's the result of us trying to protect each other.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.070
We're like fish and water,

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.000
so close we can't do without one another.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.430
So quit quarreling.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.400
Fine.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.470
By the way, are we really going to get

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.300
the Tailed Beast's power, Sasuke?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.900
Hmph. Who knows?

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.300
But it seems there's no need to rely on that anymore.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.500
Why?

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.870
I have obtained new powers...

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.970
Strong enough to destroy the Hidden Leaf.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.230
What's wrong, Sasuke?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.270
It's nothing.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.030
What is it, Karin?

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.670
I sense a chakra outside. It seems we've been tailed.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:51.970
Now, go!

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.230
Forgive me, Lord Raikage...

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.870
It appears my tail was unsuccessful.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.070
Not only Yugito, but now Bee too...

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.730
I cannot believe that Bee has been taken down!

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.930
We have been receiving several messenger lizards from Jay.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.170
Once we've pinpointed the enemy's whereabouts,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.330
we'll send in four cells to rescue Lord Killer Bee,

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.830
and wipe out the enemy.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.000
I heard it was an Uchiha from the Hidden Leaf

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.130
who kidnapped my little brother!

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.730
Why is there an Uchiha in the Akatsuki?!

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.030
Sasuke Uchiha...

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.170
It appears he went rogue from the Hidden Leaf

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.600
quite some time ago.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.070
Why hasn't the Leaf's Hokage dealt with this Rogue Ninja?!

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.630
They were so quick to react over the Hyuga incident!

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.970
Something's wrong... The messages have ceased.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.470
Naruto-boy, let's call it a day.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.830
No, not yet!

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.270
I'm the one that can't go on.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.070
However...you're starting to get the hang of it.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.270
Yes, sir!

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.300
What?!

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.100
What do you mean the messages from Jay have ceased?!

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.200
It seems Jay has either been killed or captured.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.030
So we're unable to confirm the enemy's location.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.430
Use whatever information we have to narrow down the location,

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.230
and search every inch of the place!

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.700
I don't care if you have to dispatch a battalion!

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.930
Y-Yes sir.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.370
Summon Samui's platoon too!

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.530
I'm giving them a document of intent to

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.100
deliver to the Hidden Leaf

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.770
stating that we will take care of Sasuke Uchiha!

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.200
And have them give us intel on him!

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.700
Yes, right away!

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.400
Furthermore, I'm going to convene

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.400
a Five Kage Summit Conference with the Five Great Nations!

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.470
The Akatsuki will not be forgiven!

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.600
Omoi, Karui... Lord Raikage has summoned us.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.070
Summoned, eh?

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.400
What in the world could it be?

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.630
Maybe there's a crisis...

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.930
Or maybe... We're getting scolded?

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.330
Did he find out that my body fat percentage has spiked?

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.930
Maybe eating potatoes with mayonnaise wasn't a good idea?

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.700
Omoi, you always think too much!

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.700
Why would he scold you for something like that?!

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.630
The most that would happen is

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.800
you could get sent to buy some protein.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.930
Being around you guys is so tiring.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.870
Makes my shoulders ache.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.600
The stiff shoulders are probably caused by those big breasts of yours,

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.870
although one can't say for sure.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.730
What you thought was just a stiff shoulder could actually...

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.670
Will you shut up! Quit yakking and let's go!

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.470
You ought to think things through more carefully.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.700
A flat-chested person like you may not get stiff shoulders, Karui, but...

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.300
Shut up!

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.170
Oww! Now that kick will cause... You got more to say?!

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.170
You two... If you're ninja, act cooler.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.430
Let's go!

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.970
I pulled it off!

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.600
Even though it's far from perfect...

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.370
I need more practice while in Sage Mode.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.600
And, I have to make sure no one sees me.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:08.500
Jay...

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.900
We were too late.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.670
TO HOKAGE FROM RAIKAGE

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.530
Mission acknowledged.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.170
I'm counting on you!

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.470
I knew it... I had a bad feeling about this.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.530
Damn!

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.600
Don't worry!

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.030
No way Lord Killer Bee would screw up like that.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.530
It's probably some bad joke.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.830
How can you be optimistic?!

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.870
He could be suffering right this moment!

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.600
In fact, he could already...

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.470
Shut up! I don't want to hear your pessimistic thoughts!

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.500
He's our master!

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.230
We're talking about Lord Killer Bee here!

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.270
There's no way he'd be defeated!

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.030
Aren't you worried about Lord Bee, Karui?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.370
Don't get morbid ideas just because you're worried!

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.970
Enough, you two!

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.230
We'll save Bee, no matter what it takes!

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.970
We will save him!

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.570
- Lord Raikage! - Lord Raikage!

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.470
Ah! You've made great progress!

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.600
Nice, Naruto-boy. That's some jumping power.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.700
Your Frog Kumite is also pretty good!

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.470
Heh... That's not all!

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.070
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.370
What?

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.500
It ain't over! I'm just getting started!

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.930
Come at me!

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.300
The sudden appearance of six figures shakes up the Leaf Village.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.700
Cries of fear... People fleeing in panic...

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.800
Pillars of smoke arise one after another...

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.400
Unable to fight back, the Leaf Ninjas are engulfed

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.500
by the spiral of suffering set in motion by Pain.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.930
Amidst the merciless invasion,

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.170
Tsunade is convinced the fateful day has finally arrived.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.030
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Assault on the Leaf Village!"

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.130
NEJI CHRONICLES?

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.230
Hey everyone! How're you all doing?!

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.070
Today I brought Neji,

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.770
who hasn't made any appearances at all!

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.470
What do you mean no appearances?!

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.970
I'm constantly away on important missions!

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.200
Let's see...

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.430
The last time you made an appearance was a month...

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.330
No, six months ago? Wait, how long has it been?

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.500
I forgot! I don't do it for the sake of standing out.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.770
Oh yeah? Lee and Tenten from your squad

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.570
sure stood out the last time, though.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.770
What?!

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.770
Why those two...

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.170
Hmph. They have free time on their hands,

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.500
unlike a jonin such as myself.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.330
Right, it's tough being you.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.430
Darn you!

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.200
Hey, come along with me on my next mission!

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.600
We'll call it "Neji Chronicles"

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.900
NEJI CHRONICLES and air it as a spectacular one-hour special!

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:54.100
No, no way. It'll never happen.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:58.470
So, everyone, please continue to watch only my adventures! Okay?

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.170
That's just not right!

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.570
I object, object, object!

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.100
Objection, denied!

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.400
Tune in again!
