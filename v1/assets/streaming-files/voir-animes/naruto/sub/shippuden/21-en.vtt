WEBVTT

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.400
That's his real body.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.870
After twenty years, what say we face each other?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.630
What took you so long?

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.330
But I flew back as quickly as I could.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.900
More to the point,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.670
you took too long to send over a substitute border guard.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.470
Your planning was bad.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.270
That's no way to show your appreciation.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.170
I carried out your selfish request despite recovering from an illness.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.570
Well... Shall we get going?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.130
Yeah.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.870
Yes, sir!

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.000
It can still move?!

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.900
As I thought.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.230
Just what I'd expect from my old granny.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.030
No wonder this little girl was able to dodge my hidden weapons.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.200
After all, the old lady who can see past my attacks was controlling

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.030
the little girl with Chakra threads used for the Puppet Master Jutsu.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.300
He found out.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.830
What's more, you were so kind as to attach threads of Chakra to Hiruko's tail.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.330
But to think that I'd notice it

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.230
after the tail's motion had been brought to a halt...

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.470
It was when you first attacked with the Kunai Knife, wasn't it?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.100
Threads of Chakra attached to the Kunai Knife

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.530
latched onto the tail when it repelled the Kunai Knife.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.400
I suppressed my Chakra as much as possible so as not to be seen,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.630
and yet you still figured it out.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.200
I'm amazed.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.970
But of course.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.430
After all, the one who hammered the principles of puppetry into me was...

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.830
none other than you.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.100
Yes.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.170
But the show ends today.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.100
That is my intention as well.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.830
Well then, will things proceed as simply as that, I wonder...

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.700
Granny Chiyo...?

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.100
Granny Chiyo?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.130
Is he... Is he Sasori?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.200
What is going on?

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.970
He's just as he was before... He hasn't aged a bit.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.970
What's going on?!

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.670
I was told Sasori broke off from the Hidden Sand 20 years ago...

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.130
There's no way that he could be this young.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.470
Sasori's Real Face 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.830
Damn!

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.130
The sound that I heard coming from inside just a while ago...

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.070
There's no doubt that the battle has already begun.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.100
I'd like to get a grasp of the situation, but...

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.670
You! Return Gaara to us!

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.100
It's only a matter of time

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.870
before my man Sasori does away with the group inside.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.200
If my man comes out,

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.730
then the whole point of using this one to draw out the Jinchuriki will be lost.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.730
You jerk! I won't let you get away.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.530
Hold it right there!

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.470
Naruto, wait a minute!

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.530
Kakashi Sensei, you go look after Sakura!

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.300
Good grief.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.700
Guy, how are conditions over there?

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.200
Sorry Kakashi, it looks like things will still take a while over here.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.130
Rotation.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.130
If detaining someone is your objective, there's no better way than this.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.770
If your opponent has exactly the same abilities as you do...

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.500
It probably won't be that easy to bring matters to a close.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.570
Splendid move, Mr. Imposter.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.430
Damn... Looks like it's impossible to expect back-up for a while.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.170
Sakura, Granny Chiyo, hold down the fort a bit longer!

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.870
There's no way I'm going to let you get away!

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.700
They're coming, aren't they?

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.100
Better keep up!

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.530
And then, I will settle matters properly...

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.500
Stop!

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.930
What's wrong, Kankuro?

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.970
We'll rest here.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.830
What?! What do you think you're doing, Kankuro?!

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.730
There's no time to rest easy in a situation like this!

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.270
Don't be so impatient... That's not like you, Sis.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.070
I'm sorry, Miss Temari.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.930
Just a little while... If we rest just a little while,

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.370
we'll be able to start running again right away!

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.730
Please let us rest a little while.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.900
You guys have no discipline. And you call yourselves Shinobi?!

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.570
Stop being unreasonable.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.130
These guys took turns guarding the border for a whole day.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.100
And no sooner had they returned to the village,

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.970
they had to run all the way here...

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.770
However top-notch Shinobi they may be,

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.100
you can't force them to do more than this.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.970
No, we're okay!

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.570
We can't be resting while Lord Gaara is in trouble!

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.300
We should do what we can for the Kazekage's sake!

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.300
Yes, for the Kazekage's sake!

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.300
Miss Temari! Let's head out.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.330
You guys! That's the spirit!

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.070
Now, now, you shouldn't get so fired up about it.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.100
Ebizo...

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.830
A Shinobi should never lose his composure under any circumstances.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.000
Forgetting that and pursuing the enemy too far all by himself

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.530
was the cause of Kankuro's recent failure, wasn't it?

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.130
Besides, in your current state,

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.770
all of you are not being aware of your surroundings.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.330
What do you mean by that...?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.070
Well, look at that.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.200
Th-That...?!

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.430
That must be the remains of the battle that Akatsuki fought with the Leaf.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.530
That means...

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:27.600
Yes. You have to assume that we have already entered their territory.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.800
There's no telling what kind of traps they may have set up ahead.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.030
When you're about to set foot in such a place,

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.100
you'll be annihilated in no time if you go dashing in,

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.500
exhausted the way you all are now.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.000
This is just perfect.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.270
While you're resting, I'll tell you all a story about the old days.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.870
It was long, long ago.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.030
I'm sure you must have heard of it...

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.130
The incident of the Third Kazekage.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.800
The Third...Kazekage?

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.900
Yes... The one before the previous Kazekage.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.930
Of all the Kazekage down through history,

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.800
the Third Kazekage was said to be the most powerful.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:27.100
Then the incident occurred when someone kidnapped the Kazekage.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.670
The entire village got all excited and went out seeking news

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.300
of what had become of the Third Kazekage...

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.370
Looking back upon it now,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.200
you would have to say that they simply lost their cool.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.200
The village's guard wore thin,

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.330
allowing the enemy to intrude, and panic ensued.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.100
If they had dealt with it a little more coolly at the time,

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.500
the subsequent war could have been avoided.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.070
I am painfully aware of how you all feel right now...

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.970
But...you mustn't repeat the same mistakes

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.930
that were made back in the days of the Third Kazekage.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.770
Ebizo...

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.170
did they ever learn what happened to the Third Kazekage after that?

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.000
After that, the Anbu Black Ops continued to investigate in secret,

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.900
but no body was ever found,

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.300
nor any sign that the Kazekage had been removed...

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.000
What's wrong, Granny Chiyo?

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.670
Are you so filled with emotion that you cannot speak?

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.300
That's not surprising.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.030
After all, it's our first reunion in 20 years.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.230
Sasori, you...

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.770
While I'm at it, I'll show you something special.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.430
It's guaranteed to move you.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.630
A collection that gave me a hard time when trying to kill it, but...

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:22.870
Three?

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.330
That's why I like this best of all.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.830
Th-That... It couldn't be!

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.430
What? What's wrong?!

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.130
That's...the Third Kazekage...

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.330
What?!

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.970
The Third...Kazekage?

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.270
How about it?

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.000
Doesn't that take you back, Granny Chiyo?

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.900
Granny Chiyo, the Third Kazekage...?

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.700
How could this have happened?

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:25.900
Then...

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.130
It was over ten years ago

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.500
that the Third Kazekage suddenly disappeared from the village.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.630
We scoured the countryside, but we were never able to find him.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.270
He was the most powerful of all the Kazekage's, but...

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.830
Sasori, you...?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.030
And so what if I did?

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:51.470
Do you mean to say that a retired old lady with one foot in the grave

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.970
is about to avenge the Third Kazekage?

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.300
Tough luck...

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.430
Retired, with one foot in the grave. That may be so,

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.630
but it was worth hauling my heavy behind over here.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.800
I'd have too many regrets if I were to die now.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.870
It's bad enough that my grandson

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.270
got himself mixed up with a bad crowd...

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.530
but to think that you'd betray the village

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.830
and try to meddle with the Kazekage, for the third time!

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.500
Third time?

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.170
It was Orochimaru who killed Gaara's father,

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.870
the Fourth Kazekage, but...

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.230
the one who guided them was Sasori!

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.770
And this time, Gaara and even the Third Kazekage...

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.470
Hey, hey, I don't know anything about the Fourth Kazekage.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.700
The one who guided them was my subordinate.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.430
In that case, it's the same as if you did it yourself.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.230
Can you really say that you were not involved?

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.970
Indeed, I was originally paired with Orochimaru back at the Akatsuki,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.630
so I did lots of things but...

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:10.330
You...

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:16.530
If you were paired with Orochimaru...

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.930
then that means you know about Orochimaru.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.970
In that case, there're a lot of questions I need you to answer!

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.870
Sakura...

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.870
Unfortunately, I must take you two out

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.830
and go capture that Jinchuriki.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.470
I hate to keep people waiting,

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.130
so I have no time to answer your questions.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:49.970
So...

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.730
shall we get right to it?

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.670
Here it comes!

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:06.900
Die!

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.700
He's fast!

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.230
To think that Hiruko's tail fell to pieces...

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.600
You've got some pretty good moves, Granny Chiyo.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.300
In that case, how about this?

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.230
Oh no!
Take this!

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.770
Sakura!

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.230
Damn. Did I botch it?

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.470
Saved!

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.230
With the old lady manipulating things, it's impossible to get anywhere.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.430
In that case...

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.600
Oh, no! Sakura! Hold your breath!

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.730
Is it poison?!

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.330
In this poisonous smoke, your movements will be irrelevant.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.300
Sakura--!

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.470
Guy Sensei, this is terrible!

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:41.570
What is it, Lee?!

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.030
According to the information received just now,

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.100
Kakashi Sensei is the star of today's Mini Feature!

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.530
What?! He gets a juicy deal like that while we're down here fighting?!

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.630
In that case,

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.400
we'll have to take these guys out quickly and join the show!

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.830
Youth at full power!

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:56.830
No way, we can't make it...

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.730
Hard effort will pay off! Right, Tenten?

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.030
Huh? Where's Tenten?!

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.200
She just left all excited, saying she got selected as the MC!

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.870
Next time: "Chiyo's Secret Skills" Say what--?! That traitor!
