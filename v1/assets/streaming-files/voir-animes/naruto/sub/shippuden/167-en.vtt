00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.620
THE BRIDGE TO PEACE

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.330
I won't let you get away!

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.580
Your teleportation failed.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.450
I've been paying attention to you all this time.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.370
When you suck in yourself, you always materialize yourself.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.160
And it takes longer to suck yourself in than another person or object.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.120
If I didn't stop teleporting and shift to the side to evade the explosion,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.370
things would've turned nasty.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.870
Furthermore, you are only able

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.740
to pass through objects for five minutes!

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.530
What are these?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.160
They're all Paper Bombs…

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.200
I amassed 600 billion Paper Bombs in order to kill you…

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.030
And they will continue to explode for ten minutes!

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.330
I am the one who encouraged Yahiko to establish the Akatsuki.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.200
And I was also the one who gave Nagato the Rinnegan.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.870
Both Yahiko and Nagato were acting on their own free will.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.160
They were not your pawns!

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.370
You and Konan must do everything you can to survive!

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.200
Whichever way they chose…

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.160
They both fought and died following their beliefs!

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.660
That is why their will is connected!

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.240
I will not let you interfere!

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.740
My Sacred Paper Emissary Jutsu has come undone.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.700
I didn't expect it to take this much chakra.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.450
At least…

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.950
Madara is…

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.870
…Is dead?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.410
How? You should be dead.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.160
I ran the simulations over and over.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.950
I was sure this sequence would work.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.580
The Izanagi…

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.370
In exchange for losing sight in that eye,

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.120
a user can tie the illusion and reality together.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.660
It's a Forbidden Jutsu of the Uchiha.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.780
Only those who possess both the powers of the Uchiha and Senju

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.080
can use this Forbidden Jutsu!

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.780
Uchiha and Senju? Both powers?

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.700
But that's the power of the Six Paths.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.740
You do not have that power…

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.870
Since you are a dear and former comrade,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.740
I will tell you a little about my jutsu and myself.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.620
The Izanagi jutsu is simply the practical application

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.200
of what you already know

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.580
as the Sage of Six Paths' Creation of all Things.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.080
Originally, the Uchiha and Senju were one and the same.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.280
The Sage of the Six Paths was their founder

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.370
and he passed on his blood and power to these two.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.580
He also created many things.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.200
The Power of the Shadow Style,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.160
based upon mental energies that control imagination

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.280
that can be used to create form out of nothing.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.990
And the Power of the Light Style,

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.080
based upon physical energies that

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.280
govern life that could be used to instill life into those forms.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.740
The Tailed Beasts are one such example.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.330
He used the Powers of the Shadow and Light Styles

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.950
to create the Tailed Beasts from the chakra of the Ten Tails.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.910
The incarnation of imagination into life…

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.080
that is the jutsu known as Izanagi.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.530
Just who are you?

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.240
The world knows Madara Uchiha was the one

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.410
who lost to Hashirama Senju.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.160
However, what is the real truth?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.330
The victor is the one who can gaze into the future.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.530
The real challenge begins from now.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.030
The previous battle was merely to obtain his power.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.160
I am Madara Uchiha and I possess the power of Senju Hashirama.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.450
I am the second Sage of the Six Paths.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.200
I am unique.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.580
Unable to master Hashirama's power,

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.660
some have tried to use an imperfect Izanagi, and failed.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.780
In the afterlife, the two of you can commiserate…

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.780
about being fooled by Naruto's nonsense.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.080
There is no such thing as true peace!

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.870
There is no such thing as hope!

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.870
Nagato only believed in Naruto because he wanted

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.780
to find solace within his pathetic existence.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.200
This can't be…

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.280
Nagato is going to be the bridge to peace.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.200
My job is to be a pillar that supports that bridge.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.910
He is the bridge to peace. His will itself is the bridge.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.370
I guess this is as far as it goes for me.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.780
Naruto…I know you can truly—

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.830
The rain in the Hidden Rain is never ending…

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:40.240
What's going on?

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.370
Yahiko! Nagato!

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.200
Your will shall not be extinguished!

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.740
I too believe in Naruto!

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.370
It's his turn now!

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.410
He is the bridge to peace!

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.120
And I shall be his pillar!

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.950
Thank you, Nagato.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.280
You death has made my dream even clearer to me.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.280
I am expendable, a mere flower.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.120
I shall take you with me.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.580
You called me darkness.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.080
Well then, I shall make you wilt.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.280
And I shall also make your rainbow,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.410
this seven-colored bridge of peace, fade into the darkness as well.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.200
When this genjutsu is over, it will be the end of you too.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.490
After I make you tell me where the Rinnegan is.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:28.950
So this is the place…

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.490
You are the third Sage of the Six Paths.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.030
The red hair that was once proof of your Uzumaki lineage…

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.780
turned white from exerting a power so strong.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.240
You betrayed me, and still you laugh at me?

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.370
That took some time.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.830
I should go.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.200
NAGATO               YAHIKO               KONAN

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.700
NAGATO YAHIKO KONAN The one on the right is Konan's.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.190
NAGATO YAHIKO KONAN The one in the center is Yahiko's. Nagato's is on the left.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.990
What are they?

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.330
These are flip tiles.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.280
Flip tiles?

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.200
Yes.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.950
The top is red and the bottom is white.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.830
And you flip the tiles over like this!

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.280
Anyway, when we're at the hideout,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.080
the tile will show red.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.700
NAGATO YAHIKO KONAN When we're going out, flip it to the white side…

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.410
NAGATO YAHIKO KONAN then set out.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.870
Furthermore, this picture is a signal that you'll be returning shortly.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.370
Man, what's with all this anyway?

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.530
We're only listening to this flip stuff because you're the Toad Sage.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.080
But why is it necessary to do all this?

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.200
This area is still politically unstable.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.580
There's no telling when it will be targeted.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.120
Actually, being at the hideout makes us easy marks.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.200
If we're all scattered, we can counter,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.910
with a surprise attack, for example.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.330
So if the tile is red, but someone's not at the hideout,

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.370
it could mean the enemy has kidnapped them.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.240
But if they're here and it's white,

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.870
could mean it's a transformed enemy.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.370
It's so we'll be able to recognize things like that right away, correct?

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.660
Something like that.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.780
You're very sharp, Konan. Unlike Yahiko.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.200
I figured it out too!

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.530
More or less…

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.530
Anyway, this will be a secret code between the four of us

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.620
to make sure we're aware of each other at all times.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.410
Even if we're at the hideout, we must be vigilant!

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.620
Furthermore…

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.870
I constructed a hidden underground room

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.330
that has an escape route outside.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.240
Wow, that's so shinobi!

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.330
If anything happens, use it to get away.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.030
Oh, and by the way… The tile behind you is…

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.200
JIRAIYA …is my tile.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:29.740
JIRAIYA

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.950
Now then…

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.200
Shall we begin our "Water in a Frog's Face" training?

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.780
This will hone your ability to completely become a frog

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.950
and stay absolutely still, no matter what happens.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.620
All right!

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.370
Let's get going, everyone!

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.450
I wonder if Yahiko is getting all this?

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.990
Sensei just showed us what to do.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.450
I want to become stronger!

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.080
And then…

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.410
And then, I'm going to change the world!

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.370
Before you change the world,

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.990
you must change the side on the flip tile!

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.620
Did I look like that earlier too?

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.580
That's embarrassing.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.780
NAGATO             YAHIKO            KONAN

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.280
Oh? She used the Wind Style to speed up her Paper Shuriken.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.830
However…

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.490
Damn it!

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.410
No good.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.410
You have get quicker with timing your coordination!

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.580
NAGATO            YAHIKO                KONAN

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.240
NAGATO YAHIKO KONAN Let's eat!

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.410
– Let's eat! – Let's eat!

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.830
Hey! No fair, Sensei!

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.200
Oh yeah, is that so?

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.280
That's mine!

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.330
JIRAIYA

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.700
Thank you, Sensei.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.580
NAGATO           YAHIKO                KONAN

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.410
Are you the Akatsuki?

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.200
Who's that?

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.740
The chief of the Hidden Rain, Hanzo of the Salamander…

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.950
Who's the leader?

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.330
It's Yahiko! Yahiko of the Akatsuki!

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.620
I shall remember you.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.370
Yahiko?

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.410
What does that mean?

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.370
Hanzo just acknowledged us.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.200
NAGATO            YAHIKO          KONAN

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.700
NAGATO YAHIKO KONAN Our organization is getting larger. We need to move our hideout.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.490
It's our last day here.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.700
Yes.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.280
This place changed us.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.200
We became strong.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.370
Everything began right here.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.450
We are leaving this place in order to make our dreams come true!

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.200
And…

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.330
Where did they go?

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.410
To think the secret room would come in handy at the very end.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.950
What a way to set out…

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.950
But I guess, it's appropriate for this country.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.370
Let's go, Nagato! Konan!

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.910
We are leaving this place

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.450
in order to make our dreams come true!

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.370
And once that happens…

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.620
Even if we are split apart,

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.330
let's meet back here one day…

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.700
And the three of us will celebrate together!

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:47.370
Yes. Then we should invite Jiraiya Sensei too!

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:48.950
Yes!

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.030
I guess you're right!

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.580
That took a lot of trouble,

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.370
but you got yourself a nice eye.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.240
It was always mine.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.830
By the way, this arrived too.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.870
What is it?

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.280
Intel from Kisame.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.280
We've learned the whereabouts of the Nine Tails.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.870
Everything is going our way.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.620
So this is from Kisame.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.990
Let's go collect the Nine Tails!

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.200
I can't believe the enemy knows our whereabouts!

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.200
We have to get Naruto out of here,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.280
but we can't let him know about the war.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.910
We have to fool him somehow.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.910
All right!

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.330
I've been waiting for a mission like this!

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.950
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Super Secret S-Rank Mission"

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.030
THE SUPER SECRET S-RANK MISSION Thank goodness he's stupid!

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.660
ROCK LEE'S SILLY CHRONICLES PART 2

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.240
Hop… Step… Jump!

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.200
Sakura, are you watching me?

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.780
How was that?

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.240
Foul!

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:09.160
Tune in again!
