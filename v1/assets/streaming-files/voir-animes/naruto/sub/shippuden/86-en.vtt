WEBVTT

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.270
You've finally settled down.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.170
Sheesh, what a handful.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.370
You're back.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.730
Yeah, but having to bring him back without killing him,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.630
was quite a bother.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.030
It's starting to rain.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.630
Looks like it'll storm.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.130
Let's take cover under a tree, or we'll catch a cold.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.870
Leader is waiting for word that we've captured him.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.630
Immediately thereafter,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.770
the sealing of the Three-Tails and Four-Tails is to occur simultaneously.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.600
So we make him wait a little.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.770
Once the sealing begins, we'll be working for quite some time.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.730
He seems near death.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.830
You must handle the elderly with care.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.670
You say that because you don't know him.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.170
This Jinchuriki who uses the Corrosion Style Jutsu of the Four-Tails

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.130
isn't what you think.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.030
You didn't fight him yourself,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.770
so you wouldn't understand what I went through.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.700
But, I was the one who asked to go alone.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.130
Say, want me to beat your assignment half-dead too?

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.130
Don't get so excited, Kisame.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.070
Well, I'm a bit tired, you see.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.900
I wish we could catch all the Tailed Beasts already.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.130
Don't be so impatient... It's going to take some time.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.030
I wonder about that. There's just a few more, right?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.330
And it's been decided that the Nine-Tails will be sealed last...

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.970
Otherwise, the balance will be disrupted,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.830
and the sealing statue will be pulverized...

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.970
That's what Leader said...

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.730
After all, the Jinchuriki need to be captured alive.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.670
So I say just catch them quickly and leave them tied up.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.170
Humph... Fine with me, but remember that Deidara failed.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.800
If he's going to be sealed last,

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.370
it's no big deal if we capture him last.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.370
And besides, Akatsuki is becoming too conspicuous lately.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.000
If we capture the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki too soon,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.900
the Hidden Leaf will become even more of a nuisance.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.330
Heh... You really think so?

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.600
The Hidden Leaf Village has very strong links with other villages.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.500
If they begin to collaborate, it will be difficult for us to act.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.000
It will be wiser to collect up to the Eight-Tails

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.770
with as little commotion as possible.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.930
I see. I guess you're right.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.930
There's the summons.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.700
We've been caught dawdling.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.800
You're late...

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.070
We had just finished catching the Jinchuruki when you contacted us.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.970
We tied him up good to make sure he didn't escape.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.600
That's what took us longer.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.170
So, what's up?

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.730
I got an urgent message I wanted to relay to you.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.500
Orochimaru has been killed.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.370
It's been ten years since he deserted us...

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.630
So we've been spared the trouble of killing him ourselves.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.430
I would've loved to see him die

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.830
as much as I would've loved to see the Zombie Combo die.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.370
Hidan and Kakuzu were our comrades.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.300
Don't say such things.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.800
Sorry... Back then, they were done in by...

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.130
The Hidden Leaf.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.730
The squad with Kakashi and the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.200
They're strong, that team. Even Deidara got his butt kicked.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.530
Tobi!!

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.600
Say one more word and my patience will run out! It will!

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.130
It takes self-control to be patient...

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.700
And your fuse is too short for that.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.130
Why you--! Tobi! You!

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.300
Pipe down, Deidara. Tobi's right.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.430
You got chewed out!

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.100
But Tobi, you always talk too much. Respect your superiors.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.200
Okay! Sorry!

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.500
And we're supposed to get the remaining Jinchuriki with these two?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.370
But killing Orochimaru took special skill. Who did it?

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.500
Sasuke Uchiha.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.430
I was gonna be the one to bring Orochimaru down.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.670
Hmm... He's good.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.930
I'd expect nothing less from your kid brother, Itachi.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.870
He's gathering members...

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.370
Really troublesome ninja at that.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.870
What do you mean?

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.330
You know them well too...

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.870
One of the Hozuki Brothers of the Hidden Mist...

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.400
You mean, Suigetsu? That brings back memories.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.170
And also, Bipolar Jugo.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.500
So be on your guard, Itachi and Kisame...

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.930
I dare say they're targeting you two.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.230
And the rest of you should keep Sasuke Uchiha in mind.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.070
After getting information about Itachi and Kisame,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.400
they may just come after Akatsuki.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.400
Kisame, what kind of guy is he...?

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.670
This Suigetsu...hmm?

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.730
It happened ten years ago... He had such a cute smile.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.900
A child prodigy who's been called

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.630
the reincarnation of the demonic Zabuza.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.600
Are you a river child who got stranded on land?!

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.970
Quit stopping to drink water so often!

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.630
Hmm... They seem like an interesting lot.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.170
Hey, don't get too interested. And just leave me out of it!

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.730
Never mind that already. Itachi, Kisame...

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.900
hurry up and get the Four-Tails.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.230
We'll seal him at the same time as the Three-Tails!

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.300
Understood.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.800
Cripes, and I thought we'd get to rest a bit.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.170
We have no choice. Let's hurry.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.770
Assemble

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.100
We target the member of Akatsuki

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.470
with whom we have the highest chance of meeting Sasuke.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.170
Well, I can see the logic in that.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.970
Itachi Uchiha... What shall we do?

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:40.000
If we're able to take just one of the Akatsuki into custody,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.600
Ibiki can get information about Itachi out of him.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.470
I've already issued an order to all teams to capture

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.500
a member of Akatsuki if the opportunity presents itself,

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.970
and to transport him here.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.370
That will probably be very difficult.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.300
Kakashi Sensei...

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.300
We won't be able to make them talk so easily.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.930
Even those we've already encountered were far too dangerous

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.330
and we couldn't even think about taking them into custody.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.730
Then what're we gonna do?!

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.130
Well, until we come across Itachi,

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.300
I don't think we have any choice but to be very patient and search.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.830
I can't go on. Let's take a short break...

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.270
As long as you drag your feet like that, we'll never get there!

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.700
Well, pardon me.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.300
But unlike you, I have a very delicate constitution.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.700
Huh? Look, just evaporate, you water ghost!

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.930
Why don't you get lost instead?

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.830
I thought you had somewhere else to go?

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.370
We're here.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.930
This is a big one.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.330
So you've come...

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.070
All right, we'll begin the sealing starting with the Three-Tails.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.870
All right! Assemble.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.900
Let's begin.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:17.570
We're here.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.430
What a creepy-looking place.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.370
Let's go.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.000
A hideout in an old ruin like this...

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.630
It's news to me.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.600
Orochimaru has nothing to do with this.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.630
My clan used this as a weapons store.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.300
We'll prepare for the battle that will be fought here.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.370
The passageways look so similar, it's easy to get lost in here.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.030
But what a depressing place. It stifles my breath.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.370
Sorry if it's depressing here.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:53.530
Huh?

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.370
It's been a long time, Denka and Hina.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.130
It's young Sasuke, after all...

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.500
What's your business here?

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.130
What's your business here?

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.100
Weapons and medicine... and various other things.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.100
We're preparing for battle.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.630
This is...

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.170
Oh, a talking raccoon dog?

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.770
Hey, come over here.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:19.130
Yikes...

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.470
They're ninja cats. Don't approach them carelessly.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.400
They'll tear you apart.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.670
You should warn us about stuff like that from the beginning.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.130
Did you bring us a present?

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.630
Here...a bottle of catnip.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.270
Thank you.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.370
Follow me. I'll take you to Granny Cat.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.000
I owe you, Granny Cat.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.270
It's been so long since we've met, but you're in such a hurry.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.670
Yeah. I have something important to do.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.600
You're not a ninja cat, right? There, there.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.670
No, stop. Even this one is too small.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.230
Sorry.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.000
So you're going to see Itachi, after all?

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.830
I've known you both since you were little,

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.870
but little did I imagine it would come to this...

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.230
You two are all that's left of the Uchiha Clan...

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.070
And now, you'll have to fight to the death.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.800
I'm going. Thanks for everything.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.870
Granny, don't we have something bigger for him to wear?

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.270
In that box over there!

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.370
Nothing fits.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.100
Then just wrap that curtain around him!

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.670
I don't run a clothing store!

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.730
Granny! What a rude thing to say, considering he paid us!

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.900
Fine.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.130
Pursue Itachi in order to meet up with Sasuke, eh?

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.200
Well then... Say we find Itachi. What next?

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.470
About that...

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:12.100
I have an idea. Can you spare some time?

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.370
You don't look too pleased.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.170
Pervy Sage? What're you doing here?

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.670
I hadn't seen my apprentice in a while,

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.670
so I thought maybe we could share a meal.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.570
Are you treating?

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.130
ICHIRAKU RAMEN Cripes, what's with Kakashi Sensei?

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.630
Here, we're ready to move out any time.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.400
It can't be helped. There are lots of things to prepare for.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.800
Prepare for what?

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.570
One small squad isn't enough.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.570
What do you mean by that?

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.270
Listen. If Itachi is defeated,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.170
Sasuke will lose his purpose in coming.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.630
So we have no choice but to find a way to detain Itachi.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.530
And that will require a coordinated effort with more ninja.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.330
Right now, Kakashi has his hands full trying to get this organized.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:15.970
Is that how it is?

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.700
But we're dealing with Itachi here. Ordinary methods won't work.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.900
Probably not... And we can't just avoid him, can we?

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.030
And just bring Sasuke back?

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.100
I'm sure you understand,

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:36.130
but Sasuke has grown powerful enough to kill Orochimaru.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.270
I know that...

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:42.070
But I made a promise to Sakura long ago...

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.900
That I'd "bring Sasuke back without fail."

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.800
And I can't go back on my word.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.230
What is most important to a ninja

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.070
is not the number of jutsu he possesses...

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.570
What's important is...

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.500
- To never give up! - To never give up!

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.700
Determination!

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.500
That's my Ninja Way!

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.200
You're as foolish as ever.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.570
I can't help it.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.600
After all, I'm the apprentice of the Pervy Sage.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.970
Geez, what a rude apprentice I'm stuck with.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.030
"Rude"?! What does that mean?

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.700
Exactly that, you rude apprentice.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.870
You're one to talk, Pervy Sage!

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.630
You're a no-good, perverted old man!

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.330
Here, eat this too.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.300
Oh...

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.970
Ichiraku's roast pork is still the best.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.400
Cripes, sealing the Tailed Beast is such a pain!

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.770
And there's more to go after this, right?

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:08.500
Just thinking about it frazzles me.

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:12.000
Now then... which way? Hmm...

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.830
Umm... Excuse me, Senpai, "which way" what?

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.470
What do you mean?

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:19.170
What do you think?!

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.170
Do we go for the Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki whose team is led by Kakashi...

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.430
or Sasuke Uchiha...?

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.330
Hey, we shouldn't mess with either one!

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.700
Our assignment is over!

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.000
And furthermore, Sasuke's not even a Tailed Beast!

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:36.670
Are you kidding...?!

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.630
The Nine-Tails' Jinchuriki owes me one for punching me.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.200
And Kakashi got my right arm...

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.700
Then there's Sasuke Uchiha...

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:51.030
I can't forgive him 'cuz he killed Orochimaru, whom I planned to kill.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.900
Geez...

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.100
Once he sets his mind to something, he just won't listen.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.200
Did you say something?

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.530
No.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.030
Humph. We're going, Tobi.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:08.770
Oh dear... That Deidara has gotten all worked up

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.000
about going after your little brother.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.530
Is that okay with you, Itachi?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Let's go!

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.530
I see. You've given it quite a bit of thought.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.270
Say, shouldn't we have even more guys?

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.900
It's not simply a matter of manpower.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.530
For this job, I think two squads working together are ideal.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:09.670
If our targets are few in number, namely one or two,

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:14.030
having more than three squads will make us too easy to detect

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.930
as well as interfere with the chain of command.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.400
And it will end up hindering our mobility.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.400
Restraining the enemy requires much more technique than mere killing.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.470
In coordinating the squads, it would be wise to choose members

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.730
who are accustomed to working together.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.100
Well, right now, this is the best plan.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:36.900
Thank you.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:42.200
Well, we're about ready to set out, but I don't like this weather.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.230
All right! Let's go!

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.030
The rain is perfect for cooling off someone so fired up.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.070
Okay, I'm issuing the order for a mission

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.200
to locate and detain Itachi Uchiha!

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.630
All of you, be extremely careful and carry out your duties!

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.030
- Right! - Right!

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.700
Basically, this search team is organized

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.000
by one ninja and two ninja hounds.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:45.100
However, Yamato and Hinata the Visual Jutsu User

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.030
will accompany Naruto just in case he, a Jinchuriki, is attacked.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.400
I'm counting on you, Hinata.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.130
Yes.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.170
Listen, we're after Itachi and Sasuke.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:59.370
But, even if you find either of them, come back to this point.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.070
Now, go!

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.370
Next time: "The Hunt"

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.770
- Good night! - Good night!

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.570
That was a tough recording session.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.530
Sakura, how about stopping for some ramen on the way home--?

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.770
No thanks.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.230
That was a quick answer.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.600
N-Naruto...

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.870
What's wrong, Hinata?

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.630
I-If it's okay, I... I...?

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.600
- I-I mean... - "I mean" what?!

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.570
Come to think of it, lately Hinata's only line has been "Naruto."

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.500
That's true!

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.930
Starting from the next episode,

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:33.700
maybe we can keep using the same line over and over again.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:34.570
What?!

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.000
That's what the director said.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.930
Even though it's the same line,

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.030
I'm saying it from the bottom of my heart.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.770
So when you're embarrassed?

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.670
N-Naruto... When you're happy!

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.070
Naruto...

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.630
When you're angry!

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:49.200
N-Naruto!

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.900
- Cry! - N-Naruto... - Rush! - Naruto!

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.930
- Smile! - Naruto... Scream!

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.670
Naruto!

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.330
That's okay. We'll be using these lines for a while.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:02.430
Huh?!

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.370
STUDIO N-No way.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.700
Tune in again!
