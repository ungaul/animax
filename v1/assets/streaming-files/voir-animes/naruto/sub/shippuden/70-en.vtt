WEBVTT

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.700
I can't believe his arm could move on its own

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.470
after being separated from his body...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.670
But when did this happen?

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.100
Was it back when I attacked with a Paper Bomb?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.670
He hid in the smoke and sent his right arm underground...

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.200
Tsk! Just what I'd expect of the Akatsuki.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.970
They all use insane abilities!

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.000
You said we were finished, but my powers are still unknown to you.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.470
You keep your distance when you make your next move.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.830
You're intelligent, unlike my partner.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.630
Damn it! My body...!

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.870
Do something, Kakuzu!

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.070
Oh no!

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.300
Now, Choji!

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.700
Spiky Human Boulder!

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.430
Kakuzu!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.430
S-Such power...

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.000
It seems Naruto hasn't rested at all.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.470
There's no choice.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.800
He has to complete his new Jutsu

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.700
and then we have to head out to back up Kakashi Sensei and the others...

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.800
The time limit is 24 hours, huh?

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.830
It'll be tough, but all we can do is believe in Naruto.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.100
After all, there's nobody who can work as smoothly

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.370
with Kakashi Sensei and the others as us.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.900
Kakuzu's Abilities

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.370
All right. It's almost complete.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.630
And now... I can catch up to Sasuke.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.800
Indeed you can...

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.970
However, watch out for Sasuke's fire Change in Chakra Nature.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.970
Huh?!

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.630
I guess I should explain

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.900
the comparative strengths of the Five Great Changes in Nature to you.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.030
What are...comparative strengths?

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.470
Well, put simply, I guess it means the five changes

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.700
in Chakra natures of fire, water, earth, lightning and wind

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.430
are each connected and have comparative strengths.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.930
So...what does that mean?

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.330
It's easier to explain with a diagram.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.870
There are five main Changes in Chakra Natures.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.270
First you draw...

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.500
FIRE WATER WIND EARTH LIGHTNING - ...the five in a circle. - Right.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.470
And...for example, take the first one, fire...

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.900
I'll draw comparative strengths and weaknesses in this diagram.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.800
This fire Change in Chakra Nature is strong against the wind next to it,

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.770
but weak against water on the other side.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.370
The Five Great Changes in Nature

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.900
have strengths and weaknesses in relationship to each other.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.630
Uh...Okay. So?

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.470
He's not getting it...

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.270
Simply put...

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.100
Naruto...

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.030
your Wind Style Jutsu is weaker than Sasuke's Fire Style Jutsu in relationship.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.870
Huh?!

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.030
Only Water Style can beat Fire Style.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.100
Why can't Wind Style beat Fire Style?

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.930
It may be quicker to imagine them.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.570
Wood burns hotter when wind blows.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.370
However, the fire can be put out when water is poured on it.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.330
That means if you strike one of Sasuke's Fire Style Jutsu...

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.170
with a Wind Jutsu of the same strength,

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.000
it'd backfire by making the fire even larger.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.530
However, look at the relationship of wind.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.770
Wind is indeed weak against fire, but it is strong against lightning.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.300
In other words, that means your new Jutsu...

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.370
will be strong against Sasuke's Lightning Style Chidori.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.730
Naruto...

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.500
It's a good thing you don't have the earth Change in Chakra Nature.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.570
So I'm a good match with Sasuke, huh?

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.900
Yes, only wind can defeat lightning.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.070
No, that's not what I meant.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.230
Hmm?

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.530
I mean only the power of wind can help fire

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.800
by making it an even larger power.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.600
Yeah, that's right...

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.830
Naruto!

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.830
You're awesome.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.600
Yeah!

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.800
It looks like your training is going well.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.500
I guess.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.500
Then you'll be finished soon, right?

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:19.330
Yeah.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.370
No, just a minute.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.970
Could you give me a little more time?

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.070
There's still something I want to test out.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.800
What's going on?

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.330
I knew it. It's just as Raido Senpai said...

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.400
It might be a Jutsu for hardening his body.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.870
That's his power...

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.500
Nice analysis...

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:24.100
That's right. No physical attack will work on me.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.830
I'd projected their powers to a certain degree, but this...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.200
If we can't use direct attacks, what should we do?

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.300
Shikamaru...

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.500
Be afraid, you atheist jerks!

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.230
All right! It's about time for us to counterattack!

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.600
Kakuzu, break this Jutsu already!

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.830
Sure...

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.530
It can't be...

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.870
You snuck up behind me... without me sensing you...

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.300
Too bad...

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.130
Be afraid, you atheist jerks!

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.830
All right! It's about time for us to counterattack!

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.170
Kakuzu, break this Jutsu already!

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.230
Sure...

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:46.900
It can't be...

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.030
You snuck up behind me without me sensing you...

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.000
Too bad...

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.530
Awesome.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.830
What?! What's up with that?!

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.930
I thought physical attacks weren't supposed to work on you!

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.700
Yeah! How did you get behind him, Kakashi Sensei?!

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.600
I saw everything.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.300
I saw the Jutsu you use for hardening your body.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.370
Judging from how you formed your seal earlier,

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.130
I'd say you've got an earth Change in Chakra Nature.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:25.170
In that instant... you read the speed of my seal?

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.000
And using Lightning Style at this level...

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.530
I see! You're...the Sharingan Kakashi...

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.570
Earth is weak against lightning...

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.700
We're not a good match... You're finished.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.970
Kakashi Sensei is awesome, sure enough!

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.500
Now there's just the other one!

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.630
In an instant... Just what I'd expect from Kakashi Sensei!

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.030
Yeah. We needed to take care of the mortal one first...

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.570
It'd be trouble, after all.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.000
You okay, Shikamaru?

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.370
This isn't looking good.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.170
Kakashi Sensei!

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.700
His Shadow Possession has reached its limit, huh?

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.330
He nailed your heart in one shot?

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.100
How can you get hammered right off the bat like that?!

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.100
For crying out loud...

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.870
You're next.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.830
It's over!

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.370
Oh, boy.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.500
And here you acted all cool and said, "You're finished."

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.370
What's going on...?

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.030
I'm sure I didn't miss the vital spot.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.630
All right, let's settle this right now.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.000
I intend to!

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.770
My Shadow Possession has reached its limit...

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.530
Hey, Shikamaru. What's happening?

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.930
And why didn't he die even though... the Lightning Blade nailed him?

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:37.800
Who knows...?

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:43.570
But with these guys, it would take a lot to surprise me now.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.200
Oh, boy...

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.000
I can finally move...

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.300
What're...those?

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.570
Now...shall we do this, Kakuzu?

00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:59.930
Sure...

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.030
Wh-What're those?!

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.670
That Chakra feels awful...

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.630
Lord Jashin! Watch me!

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.300
I'm going to get serious! I mean it!

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.200
I'll rip out their guts!

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.330
Watch out, Choji!

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:34.330
Right.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.530
What...?

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.830
Kakuzu! Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.030
One of them died right after our verbal assault!

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.970
God, you really stink!

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.370
Since one of the masks that came out of his body died...

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.670
it must've been that mask I hit with my Lightning Blade earlier.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.700
Looks like we got something here.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.130
Hidan, stand down for a while. I'll take care of this.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.270
Hey... Just a minute!

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:40.070
We've been getting our butts kicked the whole time and it's ticking me off.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.430
Let's go with the usual.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.400
Wind Style: Pressure Damage!

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.630
Choji! Watch out!

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.970
Kakashi Sensei!

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.430
Kakashi Sensei!

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.530
No way... He even attacked his own partner?!

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.400
I get it! He's taking advantage of the immortality!

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.200
Here he comes, Choji!

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.000
No... If they are hit head-on with that...

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.800
Choji, Shikamaru! Run!

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.500
Lightning Style: False Darkness!

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.500
I won't make it in time!

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.370
Look out!

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.800
Kakashi Sensei...!

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.270
Are you okay?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.470
Well...somehow, I guess...

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.130
These guys...are powerful...

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.070
That masked guy in particular...

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.400
But no one should be able to use such high-level Jutsu

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.070
unless they are compatible with that person's own Chakra nature.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:06.930
And he uses earth, wind and lightning...

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.130
What the heck is going on?

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.200
I'm surprised...

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.100
You're the first one we weren't able to kill with this combination...

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.600
Kakashi...Hatake.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.530
So you read it with your Sharingan, huh?

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.900
However... How about this next attack?!

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.230
What?!

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.270
Fire Style: Searing Migraine!

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.470
Our best plan would be to attack them separately.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.400
If we're going to do that, we'll need to stall Hidan...

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.630
Then I'll do it with my Mind Transfer Jutsu.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.370
No. It's too risky.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.730
Then I'll do it.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:48.730
That won't do, either.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.870
We'll be finished if we approach him and he gets some of our blood.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.770
But...
