WEBVTT

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.210
The Two Mangekyo

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.170
Zetsu… How long are you going to cling to Obito?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.170
Sorry…

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.540
But that allowed me to steal Nine Tails' other half from these guys.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.130
Good. Now bring it, and my left eye, to me.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.580
I sense Sage Power…

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.000
And it's much stronger than what Obito possessed.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.130
So the Fourth Hokage's Nine Tails is inside that black thing!

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.380
Madara?!

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.580
How did he get Six Paths' power?

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.080
Since Lord Madara is here, you can't do anything to me…

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.960
even if I separate myself from Obito.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.540
Now, Kakashi!

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.130
Why you—!

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.250
You're still—!

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.670
Not yet…

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.170
I need to ask you something, Madara.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.790
We need the Nine Tails inside that thing for Naruto.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.830
We cannot afford to miss.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.830
We have to wait for the right moment.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.040
Just what am I…to you?

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.210
You're kidding, right?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.040
What kind of a stupid question is that, at this point in time?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.080
You are only one thing to me…

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.210
You are Madara.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.170
Now go…

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.920
Until the time when I am revived…

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.880
You shall be Madara Uchiha.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.170
Madara is he who rejects the world.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.380
All who hold that in their heart…

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.830
and strive toward achieving the Infinite Tsukuyomi are Madara.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.120
That…

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.540
That was once my path too.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.330
I left you in charge of everything…

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.630
And let you walk in my shoes, while I slept, waiting to return.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.670
It's the path I guided you towards.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.210
You were supposed to live out your life as Madara

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.500
in order to achieve our goal.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.670
As the savior who rescued this world.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.080
This world laid out by the Sage of the Six Paths…

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.210
has failed.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.790
Now listen…

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.830
The chakra dispersed by the Six Paths was originally…

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.500
meant to be a linking power.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.170
The mental energies of people would connect and feelings

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.380
would be understood without the need for words…

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.580
That would lead to peace and stability.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.000
NINSHU The one who preached this as Ninshu, the Ninja Creed

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.790
and sought to guide the people, was the Sage of the Six Paths.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.000
However…

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.000
But before long, people used chakra not to connect with others

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.040
but only to link the mental and physical energies within themselves.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.080
Through a method of infusing one's own chakra and increasing it multifold…

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.130
they changed chakra into ninjutsu that could be used as weapons in battle.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.000
Ironically reverting to the way Six Paths' mother, Kaguya,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.580
had originally used chakra.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.380
Just what the hell is he talking about?!

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.210
Gaara… I know.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.040
All the Sage of the Six Paths did was to further the human paradox.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.880
And even if bonds were established…

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.830
All they learned was that true understanding was not possible.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.170
In any case, chakra only gives rise to conflict and false hope.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.080
We all know the reality all too well…

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.000
Even as we seek peace, we seek war.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.540
And this reality compels infinite suffering

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.580
through the power known as chakra.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.080
Power leads to the desire for war.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.210
And the lack of power leads to losing everything.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.670
I will build a new world that overcomes that!

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.960
Through the Infinite Tsukuyomi,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.500
I will create a dream world without any abominable chakra!

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.790
I, who possess the most powerful chakra, shall lead it!

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.460
And you are not Obito, but me…Madara himself.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:00.290
Obito Uchiha with his Uchiha Chakra, challenged Kakashi Hatake,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.630
desired the title of Hokage, and yearned for Rin Nohara!

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.540
But because his power was false, he ended up losing everything!

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.040
This is hell!

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.710
Have you forgotten?!

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.630
Come over here.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.500
Yes, come, Madara!

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.330
From this day forth, you are a savior.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.170
You are still the savior, even now.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.040
Sand Wave!

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.130
Kamui!

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.460
Sage Jutsu!

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.790
Rasengan!

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.000
No way… Their combined attack…

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.920
Now…

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.790
You damned…

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.540
What are you doing?!

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.080
No…

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.130
What I'm doing is no different than a Hokage's actions.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.210
In fact, it's greater.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.630
Because I can truly bring about peace.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.580
There's no need to voluntarily walk down a path

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.130
you know to be dangerous.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.630
You'll have to step over the corpses of your friends.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.830
It's the path I guided you to.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.380
I don't want to know the easy path.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.580
I left you in charge of everything…

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.040
And let you walk in my shoes…

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.460
The Hokage is the one who walks ahead of everyone else,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.920
who endures the pain.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.790
One who leads others…

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.920
is one who never steps over his friends' corpses…

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.210
even if his own ends up being stepped on.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:38.000
Then in order to confirm that, you'll have to become a corpse.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.920
You won't be stepping on me anymore.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.670
I realize now that letting someone handle everything in your name

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:50.130
isn't the same as truly entrusting them with the task.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.540
I am not you.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.580
Go for it, Obito!

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.960
Become the Hokage and save the world!

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.210
That's a promise too!

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.130
The current me…

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.460
is the one who wanted to be Hokage…Obito Uchiha!

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.210
Obito…

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.590
Obito…You've finally found yourself!

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.920
I passed through you.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.880
That's your original right eye's power.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.500
Are you trying to weaken me by taking away the Tailed Beasts?

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.170
Do you think you can challenge me and win?!

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.880
So weak…

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.710
Is that all? You only tore off a mere sliver of the One and Eight Tails?

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.340
Kakashi!

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.800
Take Naruto into the Time-Space!

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.710
Obito plans to hand him the Nine Tails there!

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:52.920
Kamui!

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:55.880
Kamui!

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.210
I know that when you teleport your body materializes…

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.800
If I try to teleport carelessly, he'll come after me.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.840
My teleportation speed is too slow.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.590
Since he'd been in Sage mode once,

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.920
he was able to steal some Sage Power from me too…

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.590
Madara…

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.880
could have killed me at any time…

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.130
I was so scared I forgot to breathe!

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.000
Of all the people, he's in a different class!

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.630
All right, I transported Naruto.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.340
All that's left is for you to teleport yourself there

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.090
and Naruto will be saved, right, Obito?

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.050
Damn it.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.840
You always talk down to me…

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.550
And act so superior… Just like old times.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Obito!

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.340
Rin is here to pick you up.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.000
Sorry, sorry, Rin!

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.630
I can't wait to see my great-grandchild's face, Obito.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.000
Grandma, I'm only five years old.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.920
Come on, hurry, it's going to start!

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.460
YOUTH NINJUTSU COMPETITION

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.710
Wow! This is the kunai prize!

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.130
It's so cool!

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.670
Okay, thank you very much!

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.250
I wonder what kind of ninjutsu is next?

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.210
If these are the opponents, this is going to be a piece of cake.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.630
Number seven, Obito Uchiha!

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.710
That's me!

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.960
Go for it, Obito!

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.920
What are you going to show us, Obito?

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.840
I'm going to be doing the Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.420
Wow, impressive!

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.630
All right, let's get right to it!

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.000
Here I go!

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.090
Fire Style!

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.550
Fireball Jutsu!

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.500
Six points! Seven points! Seven points!

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.050
These are great numbers!

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.420
Obito Uchiha is in the lead right now!

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.500
That was great, Obito!

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:41.170
I wasn't in top form today, but I think it's a sure win for me.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.550
All right, here's our final challenger!

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.920
Kakashi Hatake!

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.880
What are you doing to do for us, Kakashi?

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.460
Well, how about the Earth Style: Mud Wave?

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.920
Really? That jutsu requires a considerable amount of chakra.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.000
Are you sure about this?

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.170
Mud Wave? At our age?

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.840
Earth Style! Mud Wave Jutsu!

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.380
The judges all agree! Perfect 10s!

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.920
The winner is Kakashi Hatake!

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.380
Too bad, Obito.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.500
Kakashi…Hatake!

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.300
You're late, Obito!

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.750
Everyone's been waiting!

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.590
Sorry, sorry! On the way, an old man was…

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.050
Kakashi!

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.630
Kakashi's joining us from today!

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.670
Let's play kick-the-can today!

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.840
Sure! Let's play!

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.710
Kakashi's the only one left.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.210
Obito's such a fast runner.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.800
Save us, Kakashi!

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.750
I'll catch him instantly!

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.460
What—?!

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.880
Saving my friends, no matter what…

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.590
That's my Ninja Way.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.460
Want me to be "it"?

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.750
As if!

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.050
Obito was "it" the whole time.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.800
But he couldn't catch Kakashi, not even once…

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.460
Kakashi is amazing.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.000
Oh, Mom!

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.090
Obito, I have to leave.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.960
Me too! Mom!

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.960
I won again.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.130
But I'll praise you for one thing…

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.750
You're the only one until now who never chickened out.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.000
You show off!

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.250
Hey, I was praising you.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.710
There's my dad! So long!

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.800
Yeah… See you!

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.250
Say, Grandma…

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.210
Am I like my dad? Or my mom?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.460
Well, let's see… I think both of them.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.380
You are alive because of your parents.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.500
So you must honor them both and work for the sake of others.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:56.590
Oh man, oh man, oh man! This is the one day I can't be late!

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.300
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.420
It's the entrance ceremony and you're already late.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.340
Someone like you has no business being in the Academy.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.800
You'll never make it.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.300
It's okay.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.420
I got this for you.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.380
For me?

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:37.750
Yes! Just submit this and you'll be able to enroll.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.960
Thank you! You're a lifesaver!

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.420
Keep pampering him and he'll never be cured of his tardiness.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.050
Shut up! Do you wanna fight?

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.170
Say that again!

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.460
– What? – It's your fault!

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.420
What did you say, stupid Kakashi?

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.130
Kakashi Hatake!

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.920
I'll take him down and become the Hokage, no matter what!

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.170
That's the spirit!

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.000
Kakashi is different from us, isn't he?

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.670
What a dummy!

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.090
He challenged Kakashi again and got his butt kicked.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.840
As if the class loser can beat the head of the class!

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:48.380
Rin?!

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.880
Someday, I'll awaken my Sharingan,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.960
and I won't lose to him…

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.500
Kakashi hasn't been coming to class at all lately.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.420
I heard something unfortunate happened to his father.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.170
I think it's a difficult time for him right now…

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:29.710
After that, you skipped a grade and quickly left the Academy.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.960
Back then, if I had noticed the huge emptiness in your heart…

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.840
maybe our present destiny might have been a little different.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.710
I didn't realize how much

00:20:55.170 --> 00:21:00.210
the death of your father Sakumo had changed you…

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.330
Hey Rin, have you seen Kakashi lately?

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.290
Why do you ask?

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.750
I heard a rumor about him yesterday.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.750
It wasn't good, but he seemed different.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.370
Could it be…?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.420
Do you know something?

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.790
Well, no…

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.580
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Formation of Team Minato"

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.080
Well, see you tomorrow, Obito!

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:08.330
THE FORMATION OF TEAM MINATO Tune in again!
