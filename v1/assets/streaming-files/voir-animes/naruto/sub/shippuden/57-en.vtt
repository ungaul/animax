WEBVTT

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.900
You keep out of this!

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.000
I'll...save Sora!

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.530
My Friend

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.730
So Sora has impressed the real Jinchuriki, huh?

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.830
Return Sora to normal.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.200
There's nothing I can do now.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.670
Soon Sora will break loose and the Hidden Leaf will be destroyed.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.970
I won't let that happen!

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.300
Try and stop him!

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.070
No way am I getting mixed up in this...

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.300
You're not getting away!

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.370
Sora!

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.200
I got rid of him... I got rid of the Nine-Tails jerk...

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.030
And I did it by borrowing your power...

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.430
This time I'll loan you my power...

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.600
Don't hold back!

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.530
Sora!

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.270
For crying out loud... wake up already!

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.000
Naruto!

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.670
You okay?!

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.800
Hang in there, Naruto. I'll heal you now...

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.570
She doesn't have time to be healing him!

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.030
Sakura! Get out of there!

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.000
Run, everyone!

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.270
Are you okay, guys?!

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.930
- Yeah... - We're okay...

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.100
Come to think of it, what about Sakura and Naruto?

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.470
Naruto!

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.330
Sakura. You okay?!

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.300
Y-Yeah...

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.970
That's good...

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.530
More importantly, I need to heal you, Naruto!

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.730
You, more than anyone,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.930
should know how quickly my wounds heal.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.170
Anyway, I'll get Sora back, no matter what.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.530
Take care of his wounds...

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.300
Naruto...

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.570
Okay.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.170
Sora...

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.930
- Naruto! - I'll be okay!

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:51.270
You get back to the others. This is between Sora and me...

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.870
Right...

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.830
How's it going?

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.600
My Medical Ninjutsu can't heal it.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.400
Just as I thought...

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.730
It's like the time when you got hurt...

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.130
It takes longer for wounds inflicted by Nine-Tails Chakra to heal.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.200
A sharp needle-like pain will still linger on the wound.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.600
I'll be okay.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.170
So what then?!

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.330
Does that mean Naruto is the only one who can control him?!

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.600
That would seem to be the case.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.070
No way!

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.300
Naruto...

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.400
If I had made sure I defeated you back then...

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.400
this wouldn't have happened to Sora.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.900
You should be glad.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.870
That you weren't the one to kill Sora's father.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.300
No, It'll be me... This time for sure I'll...

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.600
Still on the Hokage's order?

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.930
No!

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.200
It's unforgivable!

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.170
I can't forgive you for doing that to your own child!

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.730
What's with all this parent and child stuff you're talking about?

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.600
Will stuff like that change the Land of Fire?

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.200
It won't change it. It will make it come together.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.900
Sorry, but I'm going to change this land! And the world!

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.770
In order to do that, a king is necessary!

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.830
You're wrong!

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.370
You're the one who's wrong!

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.870
Ninja Art: Super Beast Scroll

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.630
Damn it! What's this?!

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.730
You sneak out of the hospital in the middle of the night for a stroll?

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.530
I couldn't get to sleep with the clamor in the village...

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.530
Oh, well.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.770
Now then...

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.530
I can have a nice leisurely conversation with you, Kazuma.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.470
I've got nothing to say to you.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.700
Sora.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.930
That hurts!

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.600
Remember, Sora...

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.900
Remember...when we first met...

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.630
Remember when we accidently got into a scuffle with each other...

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.270
Remember when you came to help me...

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.700
Sora...

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.930
Sora.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.300
Sora!

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.370
Sora!

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.470
Damn it...

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.830
We were mistaken from the start.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.070
Mistaken about what a king refers to in the first place.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.370
We weren't mistaken.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.230
We weren't mistaken, Asuma!

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.900
If I...

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:36.570
If I die...what will happen to the Land of Fire?

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.900
Nothing will happen.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.300
That's funny...

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.900
I don't remember my dad's face very well.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:09.630
But even now, I can never forget that spotless clean breechcloth.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:15.200
To me, my dad is that clean white cloth.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.930
Kazuma... Your cause was...

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.500
Sora!

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.970
Sora.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.770
Who's that?!

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.730
Sora.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.470
Oh, it's Naruto... Let's just calm down now and...

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.100
Let's discuss this...

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.370
Hey! You're hitting me with your punches!

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.200
Man, this guy's so loud...

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.530
You okay...Sora?

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.330
Naruto...!

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.470
You jerk! What're you doing sticking your nose in this?!

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.270
As long as I'm here, I have no choice.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.770
He's so meddlesome...

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.130
Hey, what happened, Sora?

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.230
What happened between you and Asuma Sensei?!

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.070
Let go of me, you jerk!

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.330
Such an annoyance.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.500
What is it now?!

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.930
What in the world is happening up here?

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:33.970
This must be...

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.400
Captain Yamato! Sora is acting different from Naruto...

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.670
That's right.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.330
This is just a theory,

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.470
but I don't think Sora has the capacity to house the Nine-Tails Chakra.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.900
The massive amount of Chakra that has gathered up is now

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.130
attempting to escape from Sora's body.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.470
That means...

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.900
Sora...that power...

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.030
That power won't do you any good.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.000
I will...

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.530
all of us in the Hidden Leaf will become your...

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.800
We'll become your power!

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.030
Naruto!

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.870
Lady Tsunade...

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.600
Shizune! We're going out!

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.830
Y-Yes, ma'am!

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.870
What's this...? Is this the Nine-Tails?

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.170
What an enormous amount of Chakra.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.370
What?!

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.930
What's happening?

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.430
Something's not right.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:25.930
Captain Yamato!

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.700
Although it has escaped from Sora's body,

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.570
it probably needs a vessel to maintain its form.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.930
Then...

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:47.800
Sora!

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.100
You okay, Sora?!

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.470
Hey! Can you hear me?

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.900
Wake up, Sora!

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.800
Sora!

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.470
Who's there...?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.800
Somebody's calling... calling me again.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.900
Sora!

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.200
Shut up, Naruto!

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.600
Oh, you're finally awake!

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.670
Naruto...

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.570
Now, let's go home, Sora.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.800
Go home... Where am I supposed to go home to?

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:40.230
What're you saying? The Hidden Leaf Village, of course.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.770
The Hidden Leaf... You mean the Hidden Leaf I tried to destroy...

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.070
That doesn't matter! You're our friend!

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:57.230
It doesn't matter what people say. We're friends!

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.700
- Friends... - That's right!

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.600
- He looks okay. - I'm glad...

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.530
Sai!

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.870
Would you guys include me, too?

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.930
Heck no.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.070
What?! No way.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.230
What was so funny about that just now?

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.870
Friends, huh...?

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.100
Then you're not going back to the Temple of Fire?

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.330
Nope.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.870
I want to see more of the world and meet all kinds of people...

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.730
And little by little, I want to make friends like you have.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.900
I see... But make sure you stop by once in a while.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.600
The Hidden Leaf Village will always welcome you...

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.900
That's right. Don't hesitate.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:20.930
Thanks...

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.470
See you around.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.970
Say "Hi!" to Old Man Asuma for me.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.500
Sure!

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.670
Oh... Come to think of it, next time for sure...

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.200
I'll give you a posthumous name.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.400
You jerk. I just heard that's a name you give to dead people!

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.470
Took you long enough, you idiot. See you!

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:19.070
That's a first for you,

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.030
going with a climbing silver right off the bat.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.500
Let's take it nice and slow. We've got the time, after all.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.030
It's an advance guard for breaking through the enemy's defense.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.030
Sometimes you have to be able to make moves like this.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.870
I thought you didn't like moves like that. Just like me.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:42.430
Sacrifice is required in order to protect the king when your opponent is skilled.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.800
Is something the matter?

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.070
It's nothing...

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.130
I just now started to understand the importance of the "king."

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.630
Well... The game is over if you get your king taken in Shogi.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.570
If you were to liken the Hidden Leaf Shinobi to a Shogi piece...

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.170
Shikamaru... In the end, you would be a knight.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.370
Why?

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.670
Although weak in strength,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.500
a knight can advance by jumping over pieces.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.730
This unique movement resembles your flexible thinking.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.600
Then what would you be?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.800
I'm nothing. I'm just...

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.270
A sacrificial piece...huh?

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.030
Then...do you know who the "king" is?

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.070
The Hokage, right?

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.370
That's what I thought until just recently...

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.870
But it's not like that.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.470
Then who is it?

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.000
You'll understand when the time comes.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.830
You dodge well...

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.500
My attack speed is the slowest in the Akatsuki.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.830
I just can't hit anything, can I?

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.830
I see... I knew you guys were Akatsuki...

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.400
You're the only one left.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.000
Well, you're pretty good.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.600
Hey, Hidan.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:52.600
She's the Two-Tailed Jinchuriki. You'll die if you get careless.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.500
Don't give me that, Kakuzu!

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.130
I'd like her to kill me anyway.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.400
Lady Tsunade, the report from Kakashi,

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.670
who made contact with Lord Jiraiya, has returned.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.730
Oh, finally. And?

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.830
Right. It seems he verified attacks by what looks like the same pair of Shinobi

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.000
in seven locations in five neighboring lands.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.300
A pair...?

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.530
Yes. Although invasion into the Land of Fire

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.230
has not yet been confirmed, it's only a matter of time...

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.270
I see... So they've finally gone into action, huh?

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.070
