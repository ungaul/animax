00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.030
Itachi's Story - Light and Darkness: The Pain of Living

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.820
Father!

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.070
We'll discuss this again later.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.530
Father!

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.530
Returning from a mission, Itachi?

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.950
Yeah!

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.990
We haven't walked together like this in a while.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.650
Well, I'm a genin now… and have I missions.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.450
Oh, I see!

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.360
That's right.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.530
Since the Uchiha moved here…

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.200
GRADUATE'S INFORMATION SESSION

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.780
…three years have passed.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.820
We were pushed to the outskirts of the village,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.860
and the upper echelons took away our authority…

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.280
Many still voice strong dissatisfaction towards their methods.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.530
You're aware of that too, right?

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.150
We want to regain our power one day…

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.650
and step out from the darkness into the light—

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.860
Father, look!

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.150
What's so funny?

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.820
Sorry, Father…

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.530
You're the face of the Uchiha.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.780
I'm proud to be able to walk alongside you.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.530
Enough flattery…

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.490
Should we get your favorite snack on the way home?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.820
Yeah!

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.610
DUMPLINGS SOLD OUT TODAY DUMPLINGS

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.740
It can't be helped if they're all sold out…

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.900
Itachi?

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.950
Izumi…

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.650
I'm sorry, Itachi.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.570
Are you sure I didn't interrupt you and your dad?

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.820
Yeah… It's okay.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.820
DUMPLINGS - It's been a while. - Yeah.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.320
It's the first time since you became a genin.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.990
That's right!

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.280
I'm sorry I didn't get you anything for your promotion…

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.900
I didn't even congratulate you.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.610
I'm really sorry!

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.950
You don't have to apologize so much…

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.860
This doesn't really qualify as a gift.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.820
But if you don't mind, won't you have one?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.900
My mom loves the tri-color dumplings from that shop.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.610
But I guess someone like you who's brilliant and

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.280
who excels in ninjutsu and taijutsu and whizzed through the Academy…

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.650
wouldn't have a sweet tooth.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.860
Sorry for just assuming…

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.490
Well, since I opened them…

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.360
I guess I'll eat them all myself.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.950
Don't tell me…

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.860
Do you want one?

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.740
Is it strange?

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.900
Oh no, it isn't that.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.950
I've known you for quite some time,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.950
but I didn't know what your favorite foods were.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.200
Rank and gender have nothing to do

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.070
with what someone likes to eat.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.860
Yeah, that's true.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.110
Sorry.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.820
I'm sorry…

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.570
It's because, Itachi…

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.280
You looked so ready to use your Sharingan.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.530
It was funny.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.400
Okay, I won't laugh anymore. Sorry, Itachi!

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.990
Sorry, sorry!

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.780
Let me make it up to you.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.070
Is there anything you want?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280
"Anything I want"?

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.450
Yeah!

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.360
That's right. She's…

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.900
Yeah… I thought so.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.650
But that's something I can't give you.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.950
Hey!

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.650
We have another mission…

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.990
Stop flirting.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.320
We are not flirting!

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.570
Itachi…

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.450
I can't give them to you… But I'll pray for you…

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.150
I hope that your Sharingan awakens really soon.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.740
And when it does, I'll congratulate you!

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.950
How was the kunai you bought the other day, Itachi?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.700
Yes, it was quite amazing.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.530
"Quite" amazing, eh?

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.610
You're good with words.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.240
It's lightweight and has a sharp edge.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.820
You couldn't get it anywhere else for that price.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.150
Father also extends his thanks.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.990
I don't need your thanks…

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.610
How about a discount on the price of this next request, Captain?

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.950
That and this job are two separate things.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.990
I understand that, but…

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.280
All right, so we have a mission.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.030
Do you understand the specifics?

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.990
I don't get it, Minazuki Sensei!

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.030
We just have to find a cat, right?

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.200
So why do we have to wear this?!

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.070
Tenma, as always, you're so sassy.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.990
Huh?! What did you say? You got a problem?

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.070
Hey! Pipe down!

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.950
You'll wake Tamaki!

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.700
I'm not asking you to find a mere lost cat.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.320
It's a search for a Ninja Cat.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.990
What's more, you'll be going into the Den of Cats,

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.490
where cats congregate.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.950
That explains this Ninja Tool.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.990
We need this Cat Tool which allows us to understand cat language meow?

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.530
Still...

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.950
If it's only intel work, why…

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.950
Huh?!

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.950
Wow… That really looks great on you.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.740
You graduated at the top of the class at the Academy!

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.570
Have you no shame?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:55.990
Shame?

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.530
Appearance has no place in undertaking a mission, does it?

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.200
Huh?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.490
Okay, no fighting.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.360
This is the picture of the Ninja Cat that we're looking for.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.740
This cat is…

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.900
Meow, meow, meow!

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.650
Aww, don't say that, you're super cute! Meow, meow.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.030
You're wearing that thing, so cut it out with the cat-talk.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.400
It's even harder to understand, especially with your heavy accent.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:31.490
What?!

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.820
It's a mission, so it can't be helped!

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.360
That being said, this is an embarrassment to my clan…

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.320
You say that,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.450
– Hey Shinko! What's so funny?! – but it looks so cute on you!

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.400
All right! All right!

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.950
First, let's gather intel.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:48.860
We'll split into two teams.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.900
Itachi and me, and Tenma with Shinko.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.070
Scatter!

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.570
BLACK TORTISE DISTRICT RING DISTRICT HOT SPRINGS DEN CAVES Let's get going too!

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.820
BLACK TORTISE DISTRICT RING DISTRICT HOT SPRINGS DEN CAVES

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.400
HOT SPRINGS

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.990
WHITE RESTAURANT That was pretty quick.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.950
WHITE RESTAURANT Let's rendezvous with Tenma and Shinko.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.450
All right. I'll go get them.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.740
So what's the matter?

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.860
It's nothing… No, there's something…

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.280
This current mission…

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.070
Rather, that Ninja Cat.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.700
It seems that cat is pretty special.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.400
Huh? Since when are you a cat expert?

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:53.780
I'm not!

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.820
The leader of our clan…

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.820
I mean, my dad's sick… The medicine for his treatment

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.280
calls for some of that Ninja Cat's whiskers.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.950
Then you should take some, right?

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.530
It's okay, right?

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.360
I dunno.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.820
Keep me in the dark.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.030
If you take it without my knowing, it's okay.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.990
That's true.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.110
Just don't tell you-know-who!

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.070
Huh? Talk about being a coward!

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.740
Are you that jealous because Itachi, who's way younger than you,

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.240
skipped a bunch of grades and graduated first in class?

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.360
– If it wasn't for him… – What? You'd be ranked at the top?

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.320
I didn't say that!

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.650
Yeah, yeah…

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.880
Anyway, Itachi sure is awesome…

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.550
There's no point in competing with him.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:48.800
I'm not competing with him!

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.250
And it has nothing to do with being top-ranked!

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.750
We've found out the location of the Ninja Cat.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.590
Please regroup with Minazuki Sensei.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.710
Ah, rejected again!

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:12.750
CATNIP LIQUOR And the clan just keeps harping on about me getting married…

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.630
So he was chasing around some female cat

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.050
and ended up here of all places… Seems like it.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.000
It seems as though our mission is complete, but…

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.710
Okay, I'll go.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.250
Everyone, hang back here.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.090
Hey!

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.500
What do you want?

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.460
I just overheard your story and I sympathize,

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.960
so I wanted to talk.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.920
Can you even understand the feelings of a male cat

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.590
who's been rejected meow?

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.800
I do! I do understand that feeling!

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.050
I see… So you're not popular with the ladies either.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.750
Uh… yeah, that's it.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.340
Well, have a drink meow.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.670
They just don't understand a male's charm.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.670
That's why ladies just don't have perspective…

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.840
or rather a discerning eye…

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.500
Don't insult her!

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.630
Looks like there's a breakdown in communications.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.000
Damn it!

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.000
We should have done this from the start!

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.090
What's going on meow, you brats?

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.420
I'll take you on meow!

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.550
You're not getting away!

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.050
Damn it, he's going on ahead?!

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:24.090
His paw…fluffy…fluffy…

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.130
He's pretty good.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.920
We have to do something about his mobility first…

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.630
He's balancing himself with his tail.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.210
But that's not all…

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.130
Those whiskers enhance his spatial perception.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.550
In that case…!

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.130
What are you aiming at meow?

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.050
You're pretty good with the kunai,

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.630
but you've still a ways to go, meow.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.920
Yeah, you're right.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.090
I thought I could have managed five millimeters more…

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.880
Huh?!

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.090
Things went well here…

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.840
But will it be in time?

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.750
Don't underestimate Speedy Tenma!

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.670
This may end up causing more than just a scratch…

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I'm glad we were in time for both!

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.380
I…did it!

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.710
Thank you for your help.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.420
I did tell him to hurry up and settle down…

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.340
But I never expected him to fall in love…

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.750
This one has good skills, but no eye for judging females.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:32.300
I just wanted to find the best bride for the sake of our clan.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.710
The most important thing is that you're okay.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.460
You fulfilled the mission just as I requested…

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.000
is what I'd like to say…

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.090
But what happened to his whiskers?

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.000
To keep the fighting to a minimum, there was no choice.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.380
So you cut them?

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:57.960
Well, it's my fault for not giving you a heads up on his skills…

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.300
You didn't bring them back?

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.210
No… they blew away in the wind.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.210
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.380
Thank you for your efforts.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.460
Itachi… Next time you come, I'll have you take care

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.710
of the debts the Uchiha have racked up.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.090
Good thing you got what you needed, eh?

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.090
Well, yeah…

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.090
Cheer up, will ya?

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.920
The fate of your clan rests on it, right?

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.170
It's not that critical!

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.460
But…

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.460
If this cures my dad, my clan will be secure.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.300
That Ninja Cat…

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.590
And those grownups…

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.960
They're all thinking about their clans…

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.920
You'd better not be thinking that you saved me.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.710
The thought hasn't crossed my mind.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.960
Even if you didn't end up helping me…

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.550
What are you doing?!

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.130
Why are you still saying stuff like that?

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.050
He's your friend!

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.920
Of course, he's going to help you!

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.050
– Huh?! Me? His friend?! – I was just fulfilling my mission.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.800
You stop being so difficult as well!

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.880
All right! Isn't there something you want to say to Itachi?!

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.000
I swear I'll make it up to you for this!

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.670
Why can't you just say thank you?!

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.920
Shinko, that hurt too much!

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.800
Friend, huh?

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.880
Big Brother! What is this?

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.960
This is…from that time…

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.000
Life is born, and life dies…

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.630
But life is saved again…

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.340
Wait…

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.960
When I saved him back then,

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.710
I didn't think too deeply about it.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.840
He's your friend!

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.460
Of course, he's going to help you!

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.170
A clan grows… A village is born…

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.170
And bonds are made…

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.630
If that's what friends are…

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.550
We were friends, no doubt about it.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.750
We formed a bond…

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.750
That's why that happened…

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.500
We had a bond…

00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.960
That's why he…

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.460
I swear I'll make it up to you for this!

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.340
…died.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.050
I didn't understand back then…

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.710
What real pain was.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.300
The pain of losing a life…

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.920
I felt it for the first time after losing it…

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.880
No, I was made to realize it…

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.090
The feeling of not wanting to lose something precious.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.170
Big Brother!

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.460
Your eyes!

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.050
Will the day come when you'll possess these eyes too?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.380
The day when you come to know what sadness is?

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.340
All right, I'll be going.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.590
Big Brother! You promised we'd play today!

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920
That's right!

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.630
But I have a mission.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.920
Forgive me, Sasuke… Next time.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.630
Sorry about that, Sasuke.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.460
I'm going to borrow your brother for a little bit.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.840
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Shisui's Request"

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.710
Sasuke was glaring at me too!

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.880
Itachi's Story - Light and Darkness: Shisui's Request

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:17.800
Tune in again!
