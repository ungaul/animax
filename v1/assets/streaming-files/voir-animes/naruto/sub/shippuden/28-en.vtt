00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.130
At midday in ten days,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.570
go to the Tenchi Bridge located in the Village Hidden in the Grass!

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.200
I've got a spy working as one of Orochimaru's subordinates...

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.330
I was supposed to rendezvous... with him...there...

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.830
Things have gotten quiet at the enemy hideout.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.930
Has the fight been settled?

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.630
Neji, can you hear me?!

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.600
What's happening at the enemy hideout?!

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.630
Give me...a minute.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.130
It looks like the fight's been settled.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.200
You say the fight's been settled?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.270
Then!

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.130
Sakura--!

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.230
S-Sakura!

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.270
What's going on with Sakura?!

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.530
Sakura's okay. They're both walking.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.930
I see! So they beat one of the Akatsuki!

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.200
I'd expect no less from Sakura.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.870
But things have gotten problematic...

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.970
What do you mean?

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.300
There were actually two Akatsuki members in the hideout...

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.030
Even though one of them has been defeated,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.630
this Jutsu hasn't worn off...!

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.630
Which means...

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.070
the other one cast the Jutsu...

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.130
or...

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.500
It's a Jutsu that won't wear off even if the caster has been defeated?

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.500
There's a possibility.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.600
That means we just have to...

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.800
defeat our clones, right?!

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.570
Beasts: Alive Again! 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.400
Granny Chiyo!

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.070
I'll heal you now!

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.300
But this won't be an ultimate solution.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.130
I've got to do something...

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.800
about the poison that entered her body...

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.030
I used up all of the antidotes I made with the ingredients

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.270
that could be procured in the Hidden Sand Village.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.430
If I make arrangements right now

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.500
and have the ingredients transported to the Hidden Sand Village...

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.200
we just might make it in time.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.700
Let's hurry back to the village.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.270
I'll make another antidote immediately...

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.800
No...

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.170
Why?!

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.730
We've finished what we were supposed to do.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.170
We need to return to the village

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.530
and neutralize the poison immediately...

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.730
More importantly...

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.270
I've still got...

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.270
something I must...do.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.900
A new Sharingan...

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:00.530
What is it?

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.170
Kakashi Sensei... It's okay if you fail.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.670
I'll make sure I settle things in the end!

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.130
Right...

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.400
If your turn comes around...

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.230
Right!

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.300
What's this...?

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.070
Just as I thought...

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.930
Hey... Aren't these guys becoming stronger than before?

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.670
Indeed, he's begun hitting me with powerful shots...

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.970
No, the enemy hasn't gotten stronger.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.330
Exactly...

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.130
We've gotten weaker.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.030
We've gotten weaker...?

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.600
What do you mean, Neji?

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.470
Can you... tell us the reason why?

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.500
It's very simple.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.530
This Jutsu probably...

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.170
All right! Everyone! We'll remove the tags on three!

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.070
One... two... three!

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.670
It copies precisely at that moment,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.130
the ability and form of the person who removed the tags...

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.870
and then they attack.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.200
That's why we've had trouble finishing them off.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.900
But unlike them, we're flesh-and-blood humans.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.670
If a fight drags on, we get tired.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.130
And the execution of our Jutsu and our movements worsen...

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.430
So it feels like the enemies have gotten a lot stronger...

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.100
Then the longer the fight drags on,

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:24.130
the more fatigued we become and... we'll be at a disadvantage!

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.770
That's about the size of it.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.130
No way!

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.970
Even so...

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.770
we must not...lose here!

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:58.900
Oh no!

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.730
Damn you...!

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.230
Damn it!

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.770
Sakura...

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:42.770
Lee?!

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.900
What's the matter?! What happened?

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.470
Oh! It's so simple...

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:55.870
What do you mean?

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.330
I figured it out!

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.470
I figured out how to beat these guys!

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.400
What?!

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.300
Really?!

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.430
How do we beat them?!

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.170
It's a surefire method, right?

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.400
Yes! It's an absolutely surefire method!

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.300
We just have to get stronger...

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.970
than we were when we first encountered these guys.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.370
The enemy just copied our strength...

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.100
at the moment we removed the tags.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:10.800
So!

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.970
If we get stronger than we were at that point,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.430
we can definitely beat them!

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.600
Good job noticing that, Lee! That's my favorite pupil.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.200
It may sound logical,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.470
but there's no way we can get stronger just like that!

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.030
Have you forgotten, Tenten?

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.130
Have you forgotten the motto from our training?!

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.800
Stronger than you were yesterday!

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.870
With those words engraved in our hearts...

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.770
we endured harsh training!

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.530
What's the matter?! Are you done already?!

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.170
You're no better than you were yesterday!

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.700
W-We're just getting started...

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.230
We won't give up at the same point as yesterday.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.570
We've got to...get stronger...

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.500
Stronger than you were yesterday!

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.630
Stronger than you were yesterday!

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.070
Stronger than you were yesterday!

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.670
- Stronger than you were yesterday! - Stronger than you were yesterday!

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.630
As a result of our training, Tenten and I became Chunin...

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.430
And Neji became a Jonin!

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.000
It's a result of our continuous efforts

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.930
to get stronger than we were yesterday!

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.430
But are we all satisfied with who we are right now?!

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.530
I...I...

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.570
I want to be better than I was yesterday!

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.270
Half a day ago...

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.330
A minute ago!

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.130
I'm going...

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.930
to be better!

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:15.200
I've never once thought that being a Jonin was my final goal!

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.030
I've no intention of toning things down... any time soon!

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:26.430
I've no intention...of dropping...out!

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:43.400
Youth...at full power!

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.230
8 Trigrams...

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.000
Hazan Strike!

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.930
Weapon Control...

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.970
Tensasai!

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.730
Great...Leaf Flash!

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.270
Yeah!

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.600
Sorry to keep you guys waiting!

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.770
Next time, Kakashi Sensei will finally unleash his new Jutsu!

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.130
He'll pound on that Deidara!

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:45.900
That's right!

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.370
Kakashi Sensei tends to put on airs and prolongs things...

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.700
Plus he's good at giving suggestive ideas,

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.100
while dodging our questions.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.100
But when push comes to shove, he always gets tough!

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.000
That's true! He hasn't aged all these years for nothing!

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.200
Go get 'em, Kakashi Sensei!

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:59.070
Do your best, belated hero!

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.730
Um...you two?

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.130
If you're going to cheer for me,

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.570
can't you at least do it a bit more seriously?

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.870
Next time: "Kakashi Enlightened!"
