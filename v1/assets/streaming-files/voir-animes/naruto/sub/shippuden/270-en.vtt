00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.630
A Fabricated Past

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.250
I think… I've mastered Sage Power.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.540
Well, you just might be able to take Kaguya on.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.710
A Messenger Toad?

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.420
What?!

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.830
What happened?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.750
Kaguya has returned and they're not able to contact Hamura anymore.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.500
Then…

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.000
It's safe to assume that she has seen through our plans.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.710
The moment of confrontation has now arrived.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.250
Forgive me, everyone!

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.540
But this is the only way to save this land.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.000
This is far enough.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.580
Any closer, and it would be dangerous.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.580
Go and hide somewhere.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.670
If you and Kaguya fight…

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.130
…I can't begin to imagine the scope of the battle.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.080
This is for the both of you.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.170
What is this tag?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.420
SAGE SAGE Do you feel its enormous power?

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.540
It's a treasure that has been passed down

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.040
in the Land of Toads.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.710
It is forbidden to take it outside of our land,

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.210
but our lives are also on the line.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.790
There is Sage Power infused in that tag.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.330
Our ancestors sacrificed their lives to make it.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.080
Use it when you don't have time to replenish your Sage Power.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.000
It can only be used once, but it can revive you,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.540
even if you're on the verge of death.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.630
I am indebted to you.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.080
I will pray for you and your brother's success.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.580
Mother.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.540
Hagoromo…

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.290
You two broke the law and went to that peak, didn't you?

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.670
Hiding things from me is useless.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.580
I can read your thoughts and feelings.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.630
Then you must know why we're angry with you, Mother.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.630
It seems you were in love with that young girl…

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.710
Not just her…

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.710
But everyone from this land, every single one of them…

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.580
I loved them all, Mother.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.750
I also found out what you did in the past.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.750
Why would you do such a terrible thing?

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.540
You both don't know how dreadful they can be.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.250
That is why an army is necessary.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.630
They're your soldiers?

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.330
Mother, just what are you?

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.790
Where did you come from?

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.710
I come…

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.580
from a place far, far away in the sky…

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.580
A place where you two can never go.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.670
But someday, they will come to take me back.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.540
Love doesn't work on them… They only understand power.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.830
Still…

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.710
even you must have believed in love in the past?!

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.500
We are proof of that love.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.460
But…

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.080
my love was also betrayed.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.670
Lady Kaguya!

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.960
My strength…

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.790
Lady Kaguya is with…

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.290
Aino!

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.710
And now, I am to be betrayed by the two

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.580
for whom I risked my life, and shared my power with.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.040
Mother, please feel the power of love once more…

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.540
and stop the Ritual of the Divine Tree!

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.420
I will not.
Mother!

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.210
I protected you, and nurtured you all this time.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.630
It seems it was all for naught.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.380
We will never see eye to eye.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.170
So, Hagoromo…

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.920
I am taking back…that power.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.540
Hamura!

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.630
Mother!

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.920
What did you do to Hamura?!

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.460
Hagoromo, if this love you speak of is real…

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.500
you will not be able to kill Hamura.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.500
Snap out of it, Hamura!

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.830
I'm not your enemy!

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.580
So she took Hamura as a hostage!

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.580
If he stays on the defense the whole time, even Hagoromo will…

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.420
What's he planning on doing?

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.540
Forgive me, Hamura!

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.250
Elder Brother!

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.500
I…

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.880
Mother was controlling you.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.790
I messed up, didn't I?

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.420
Don't talk. I'll heal your wound.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.130
SAGE

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.040
Damn it…

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.540
Using the Secret Treasure of the Toads for that purpose…

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.830
The wound is healed!

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.830
What did you do, Elder Brother?

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.540
If we make it out of this alive, thank Gamamaru.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.080
Hagoromo…

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.580
Hamura!

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.250
Mother…

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.250
I am indebted to you.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.540
You enabled me to awaken my Mangekyo Sharingan and Rinnegan.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.080
What is that?

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.750
Elder Brother!

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.040
Look!

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.630
What in the world is that?

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.040
I feel an enormous power…

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.420
And that is how Hagoromo and Hamura's battle

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.630
with my mother Kaguya began.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.290
This is where the real battle started.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.420
Mother had the power of the Divine Tree.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.880
In order to protect Mother,

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.040
the Divine Tree turned into the Ten Tails.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.750
The Ten Tails was not just the Divine Tree,

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.830
but also my mother herself.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.540
It was not just the manifestation of the Divine Tree

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.500
trying to take back chakra…

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.710
It was the will of my mother trying to take back

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.670
the chakra she had shared with her two sons.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.540
The intense fighting between my mother and the brothers

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.920
continued for months.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.710
It took a massive toll on the land.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.250
And at long last, the decisive moment came to be.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:54.750
Hagoromo and Hamura's powers overcame Mother's.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.830
Now, Elder Brother!

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.710
Catastrophic Planetary Devastation!

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.680
Mother gathered up every ounce of energy she had left,

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.340
and just before the seal took hold, she gave birth to me.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.880
You…came out of her?

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.470
Even Hagoromo did not know of this truth…

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.550
Nor was he aware that

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.800
I was working on her behalf to restore her.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.340
I split the Ten Tails into nine souls.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.300
When you look at them like this, they're very cute.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.340
What will you do with them?

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.340
I will take care of these Tailed Beasts.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.090
I will raise them to trust humans and to help them.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.380
Elder Brother, I think I'm going to stay by Mother.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:27.720
Hamura?

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.220
When I was being controlled,

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.300
Mother's consciousness was present inside of me.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.510
I felt her emotions.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.130
Mother was afraid all of the time.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.090
In order to protect us,

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.680
Mother only did what she thought she had to do…

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.260
It made me feel that she was just a woman, alone all by herself.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.470
I guess I love Mother, after all.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.380
Hamura…

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.430
You are a kind soul.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.720
Elder Brother… I will always be up there in the sky…

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.800
watching over the world you create.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.430
Come visit once in a while.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.470
We won't be that far apart.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.430
I will. Take care of yourself.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:26.050
And so, that's how the battle between my mother and the brothers ended.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.510
But I was left, with no power at all.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.550
That is why I went deep into the darkness,

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:38.220
and carefully planned my mother's revival.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.680
In the meantime, Hagoromo was ignorant of all of this

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.510
and raised Indra and Ashura.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.840
He even created that Ninshu, Ninja Creed nonsense.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.880
Time passed and Hagoromo died…

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.800
And just before passing away,

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.880
he scattered the Tailed Beasts to various parts of this world.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.380
Two things are required to revive Mother…

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.130
The Divine Tree and Infinite Tsukuyomi by means of Rinnegan.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.090
But the Rinnegan requires Hagoromo's chakra,

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.050
which he passed on to Indra and Ashura.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.680
And the Tailed Beasts, which form the Ten Tails,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.380
were scattered across the world.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.050
In order to bring Mother back, all of these things had to be collected.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.010
You can't imagine the amount time that was required to do this.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.880
So first of all, in order to regain Hagoromo's chakra,

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.430
I took advantage of Indra who lost the fight over succession.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.510
I tempted Indra.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.680
And later, I selected Indra's descendants,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.050
the Uchiha to be the cast of my tale.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:49.050
I revised the stupid script that Hagoromo wrote just a little bit.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.510
You mean…?!

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.510
That's right. Hagoromo's Stone Tablet…

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.340
I rewrote it to say the Infinite Tsukuyomi

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.050
was the path to save the Uchiha.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.760
I must say…

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:08.180
You Uchiha performed your parts brilliantly.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.340
Why you—!

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.430
Indra and the Uchiha.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.880
Ashura and the Senju.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.180
I was able to set up a pattern of fighting and power seeking.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.090
Furthermore, time after time,

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:30.430
I'd approach the reincarnate of Indra and Ashura in each clan…

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.380
to attempt Rinnegan manifestation.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.510
But it always ended in failure.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.550
Just with that alone, a thousand years passed.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:46.300
But when Madara Uchiha and Hashirama Senju were reincarnated,

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.300
I came to believe…

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.430
that Madara could achieve it.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.470
That this was the first step towards Mother's revival.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.010
However…

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:28.090
Madara Uchiha lost to Hashirama Senju…

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.380
I thought I had to go back to the drawing board.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.380
But Fate did not turn her back on me…

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:43.430
Madara's corpse is like a treasure trove to a shinobi.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.090
Tobirama, who had been studying the mysteries of the Sharingan,

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.340
stopped short of disposing his corpse.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.130
And instead, hid Madara deep within the mountains of the Leaf Village.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.380
But Madara was no fool…

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.970
He figured that if he lost to Senju in battle,

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:03.050
Tobirama would not get rid of his body.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.510
So he placed a jutsu on himself.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:09.340
You can invoke a time-delay spell in one's eye

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.880
using the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.090
Just like the way Itachi implanted the Amaterasu

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.930
with a time delay in you, Sasuke.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.550
Madara had installed the Izanagi in his right eye.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.430
At the cost of his right eye,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.180
Madara rewrote reality and returned to life.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.220
He then passed off a shadow clone as his corpse.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.300
He vomited the flesh he bit off of Hashirama,

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.300
and grafted it on his wound.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.800
After that, Madara awakened his Rinnegan…

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.380
and summoned the Gedo Statue.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.260
He then cultured Hashirama's flesh using the Gedo Statue,

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.510
in an attempt to prolong his life further.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.340
Those goblins, the White Zetsu,

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.880
seemed to be an incidental by-product of that.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.680
But they were actually the people put under the last Infinite Tsukuyomi,

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.300
whom I extracted from the statue.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.050
I just made it look that way.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.010
"Two polar opposites operating together

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.380
gives rise to all things in this universe."

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.090
Just as it was inscribed in the Stone Tablet,

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.300
Madara solidified his attachment to Hashirama.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.090
I began formulating a plan…

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.340
to collect the Tailed Beasts by making it look like

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:31.470
I was born out of Madara, and to also manipulate Obito.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.340
I formed the Akatsuki and steered them towards war.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.340
In order to increase battle strength,

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.840
I deliberately let Kabuto discover Madara's corpse…

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.220
And in addition,

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.680
I guided him to use Madara's corpse as a bargaining chip,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.970
and made Obito cooperate.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.300
This war went exactly as I planned.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.720
The Infinite Tsukuyomi was launched during this war…

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.930
And by amassing a large amount of the human chakra

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:02.470
that had been scattered… Mother was restored.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.880
I detest you…

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.300
Hagoromo… Hamura…

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.840
You are mine.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.720
My role has come to an end.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.680
You shall return with me to the almighty god that is mother.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.260
You two alone aren't the entirety of shinobi history!

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.220
Besides, moms are supposed to be happy

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.130
about their kids leaving the nest!

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.630
Your teenage rebellion continues…

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.550
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The No. 1 Most Unpredictable Ninja"

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.300
You brats can't hope to accomplish anything.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:28.680
THE NO. 1 MOST UNPREDICTABLE NINJA Tune in again!
