WEBVTT

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.480
I really didn't want to experience war in my lifetime.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.730
What if…

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.570
What if we suddenly come under a surprise attack

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.280
and I'm the sole survivor…

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.860
and…I'm captured and tortured?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.570
And then, after that…

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.690
What if the enemy messes around inside my head…

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.150
and I'm forced to fight Karui and Lord Raikage?

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.690
Omoi!

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.610
Hey, Omoi!

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.480
Are you listening?

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.730
We're going to descend now

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.400
into the airspace above enemy territory.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.530
Stay alert!

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.530
Sir…

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.610
Can I ask you something?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.480
What is it?

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.320
You and I aren't too far apart in age, Captain.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.980
This is your first war, right?

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.820
Yeah…

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.940
Are you nervous?

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.440
Listen up!

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.730
The outcome of this war will depend

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.570
on the effectiveness or ineffectiveness our Commando Unit.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.030
The number of casualties also depends on us too.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.570
Think only about success!

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.530
If you want to protect your family and friends!

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.360
War Begins!

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.610
And how should we evacuate?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.480
Continue heading south from the Land of Steam

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.110
into Hidden Leaf territory.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.480
The north will likely become a battlefield.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.860
Hey, someone…

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.900
Yes, my lord.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.110
It's taking quite long.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.690
Please be patient for just a while longer.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.480
They've been bombing indiscriminately with the detonating clay.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.360
We have to put more distance between us!

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.530
They're still coming after us.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.030
I'll increase the power of the jutsu.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.650
You irritating bugs, hmm!

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.610
Stop hiding all over the place. Such a pain.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.690
The insects are disrupting my sensory chakra.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.320
It's a jamming jutsu using insects.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.980
They're good enough to be an infiltration and reconnaissance unit.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.570
However, don't underestimate this artful duo!

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.980
If they're attacking with insects, we'll answer with this.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.650
They are swarming!

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.570
I got separated from Ranka…

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.440
I'm counting on you.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.110
I must join up with the main regiment.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.900
Gather round.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.650
We're in enemy territory.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.230
We're going to set up a base camp here.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.150
And we'll conduct surprise attacks and set traps!

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.530
Keep a ten-meter radius!

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.110
The exit points will be at two and six o'clock!

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.530
Omoi!

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.820
Lay traps of Paper Bombs in every other direction.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.110
Right…

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.690
Sai! Continue aerial surveillance!

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.150
Roger.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.780
Ittan, create trenches with your Earth Style!

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.030
Will do.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.230
Tango, put up the antenna for the Chakra Communications.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.190
Right.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.570
Zaji and Hoheto, you two will be on sensory and watch duty.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.440
Got it.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.610
Kiri and I will review our plan of action.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.690
Understood.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.150
Well, you've got me, a Sensory Type,

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.230
so you can all relax.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.690
Never let down your guard in times of war, Zaji!

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.190
It can cost you your life.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.940
Stay focused.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:54.980
I know.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.900
I may not look it, but I was picked for this unit because of my elite skills.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.400
So anything else we should be wary about?

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.400
Kabuto uses one of Orochimaru's ninjutsu

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.230
known as the Reanimation Jutsu.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.400
According to the reports,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.400
corpses are brought back to life, their souls held in bondage.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.070
And they cannot be killed, no matter how many times you attack.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.440
Jutsu to seal the souls or stop their movements

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.900
seems to be the only solution.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.110
Furthermore, even if we manage to kill the jutsu user…

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.480
the jutsu itself can't be broken.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.570
The goal of every unit will be to find Kabuto and restrain him.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.150
After that, we will break his troublesome jutsu with genjutsu.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.110
That's what I understand.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.320
First Company, with me!

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.320
This is a jamming jutsu.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.110
What's wrong?

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.860
I can't sense for sure because of a jamming jutsu, but…

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.280
Something's coming.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.150
Is it the enemy?!

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.480
That's Muta! I can tell by his chakra.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.070
The one from the Aburame Clan

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.480
who was with the reconnaissance unit.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.780
Hey, wait!

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.280
It's booby trapped out there. I'll bring him back.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.400
That guy!

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.400
Muta, are you all right?

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.650
Hoheto!
I know.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.230
Byakugan!

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.400
Get away…from me!

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.900
The insect bag on his back…

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.570
They're not insects of the Aburame Clan!

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.610
What?!

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.610
Zaji, get back here!

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.190
Be careful!

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.650
They saw through it instantly.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.110
Muta!

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.690
I'm so sorry! Everyone get out of here.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.690
No one can help me.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.530
Those movements… He can't be…!

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.230
That's why I said to stay alert!

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.230
He's using Zaji as a shield and running towards us.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.360
W-What'll we do?

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.860
– Do it, Deidara. – I know.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.650
There's a white clump that's packed with chakra

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.110
in the insect bag on Muta's back!

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.400
That's suspicious!

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.650
It's got to be one of Deidara's clay bombs.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.440
Ittan, do it!

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.570
Earth Style: Mobile Core!

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.030
Now that's art… The Hidden Leaf in bits and pieces, hmm.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.440
Make sure.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.400
They're still there.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.610
We couldn't save the guy from the Aburame.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.690
Damn it.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.400
Kiri, tend to Zaji's wounds.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.440
Right.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.480
Can't we even take a moment to mourn our dead in war?

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.860
Hey, don't move!

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.570
Here they come again! Stay alert!

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.530
We don't even get some time to think?!

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.650
What the heck!

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.940
Cloud Style! Crescent Moon Slice!

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.150
They are…

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.980
Tokuma! Ranka!

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.730
Our comrades again?!

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.570
Are they being manipulated?!

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.440
Again! Above us!

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.860
Nice, Sai!

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.190
We're keeping these guys alive.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.440
You damn…

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.400
Now…what will you do, hmm?

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.780
You're playing dirty.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.690
I won't forgive you!

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.650
Sasori, I know you're there.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.860
Come on out.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.230
Hmm… You're a puppet master, after all.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.820
You're also a Commando Unit, I take it.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.780
It's unusual for two Commando Units

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.360
to engage each other like this.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.570
The one who wins here will succeed in a surprise attack.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.730
We started this war.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.150
And a victory here will determine the course of the entire war, hmm!

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.480
Then we'll win.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.980
Is that so?

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.610
Well, we cannot lose.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.190
It's because…

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.400
we're invincible, hmm!

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.440
What's wrong?

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.070
Impossible…

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.400
Run away, little brother.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.480
Our bodies are indestructible.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.070
There's no way you can win!

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.480
Brother Shin.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.480
Brother?

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.400
What an emotional reunion, hmm!

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.730
They're intentionally pitting people we know against us?

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.070
How dirty!

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:39.280
Can't waste time feeling anxious.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:42.320
Trying to hurt our comrades…?

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.030
Well, I won't stand for it!

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.070
This is war! There's no room for niceties here, hmm.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.530
Hoheto, Tango, go!

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.150
You're next, Ittan!

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.570
Deidara, you…!

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.530
Brother, snap out of it!

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:07.730
Nice moves.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.320
But even if you make contact, nothing will happen.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.150
I must hand it to my good man, Sasori.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.900
There's no need to counter this, hmm!

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.030
Cloud Style: Back Slice!

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.320
Well done, Omoi!

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:32.570
No effect.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.070
He pretended to swing directly at me,

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.360
but actually slashed back!

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.480
So stupid!

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.480
Cutting my chakra thread…

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.610
What fine swordsmanship.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.440
Over here!

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.980
Ittan, raise us up!

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.150
Earth Style! Mobile Core!

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.070
What?!

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.190
This unit was hastily assembled,

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.190
but we're pulling it off quite well!

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.610
Why you—!

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.440
It's the first time I've seen you in that form.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.860
Attaching your threads to mine and reeling me in…

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:34.150
Your thread-handling skills have improved since last time, Kankuro.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.400
Frankly, it's nice to get praise

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.820
from a Red Secret Technique Master.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.400
But my Black Secret Technique is now superior to yours.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.940
I never imagined you'd still be alive.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.360
So there was an antidote to the poison I used the last time.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.860
Fate deemed that I would fight you again.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.110
Hold it!

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.150
I've never forgotten about that day,

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.650
not for even a moment.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.780
You've got solid talent.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.110
However, you picked the wrong opponent.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.400
Your puppets with the hidden and poisoned weapons…

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.650
I can see through them all.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:44.650
How?

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.980
This is the first time my hidden weapon attacks

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.610
have been read like this.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.530
That's to be expected.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.400
Black Ant… Salamander…

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.320
The one who created these three puppets

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.690
is none other than me.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.400
Then…

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.280
you're the celebrated master craftsman

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.400
of the puppet unit…

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.070
Sasori of the Red Sand?!

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.690
The poison's circulating, huh?

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.320
I won't finish you.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:38.610
However, that poison will kill you in less than three days.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.690
I owe you one for last time.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.980
SASORI

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.230
Sai, run away.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:43.030
I don't want to fight you.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.440
Brother Shin…

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.650
I don't want to hurt you, so I…

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:53.530
This jutsu that toys with peoples' lives and feelings…

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.070
I'll…I'll—!

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.730
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Sai and Shin"

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.360
SAI AND SHIN I'll never forgive you!

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.980
SAI AND SHIN

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.570
Tune in again!
