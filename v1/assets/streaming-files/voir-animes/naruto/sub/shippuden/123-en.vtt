00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.070
The world will know real pain.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.370
The fear instilled by that pain would prevent wars.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.370
And the world will be on the road to stability and peace.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.200
But that kind of peace...

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.500
It's nothing but a fake!

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.730
Humans are not the most intelligent of creatures.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.970
This is the only way that peace can be achieved.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.330
And after several decades,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.600
that pain too will eventually fade with time.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.030
It will no longer be a deterrent

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.230
and humanity will begin to battle once more.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.730
This time, they themselves will use the Tailed Beast Weapon

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.300
against one another and reconfirm what true pain is.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.430
And then peace will be restored again, for a time.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.800
In the course of this endless cycle of hatred...

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.070
Pain will give rise to momentary peace.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200
That is my dream.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.300
Nagato...try not to push yourself.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.930
You've already spent so much chakra.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.230
Peace is right within our grasp.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.910
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.000
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.420
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.340
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.140
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.440
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.650
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.280
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:19.910
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.910
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.080
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:35.300
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.800
koete Someday...

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.570
Now get this!

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.900
I'm absolutely gonna be named the Hokage!

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.500
You just watch, everyone!

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.500
That boy.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.070
He's... The awful Nine-Tails...

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.170
Hey, that topic is taboo.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.070
Nine-Tails? What's the Nine-Tails?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.970
It's something you do not need to know, Lady Hinata.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.070
But...you must not go near that boy.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.400
Naruto...

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.370
You argue that my vision of peace is a fake.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.300
But in this cursed world, there is nothing more fictional

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.900
than a peace where people can truly understand one another.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.370
But I have faith that

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.300
there will come a time when people can truly understand one another.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.400
Pervy Sage believed that the day would come

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.630
when people truly understand one another.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.230
You're wrong!

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.230
Empty words...

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.630
What can you do when you can't even back up your answer?

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.630
All you are good for...

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.570
-...is giving me the power -...is giving me the power

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.930
of the Nine-Tails.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.870
Like I told you earlier...

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.300
your death will lead to peace.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.130
Confessions I want to grow up to be a great ninja...

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.230
strong like Father and kind like Mother!

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.870
Lord Hiashi is very strict

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.930
because he has high hopes for you.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.970
One day, you will enter this Academy too, Lady Hinata.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.430
I wonder if I'll make it...

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.370
Of course you will. So you must do your best.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.870
That boy...

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.630
Lady Hinata, please don't associate with him.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.500
But why?

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.100
It's time for your training. Let's go back.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.430
Naruto...

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.770
What's wrong, Neji?

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.430
That's Lord Jiraiya's Summoning Frog.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.470
What?!

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.070
So the real Pain will be at the highest spot,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.470
somewhere near the Leaf Village.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.770
All right, let's search every single site that is at high altitude!

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.000
Work in teams with at least two people per cell.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.070
And if you find the real Pain, do not engage him carelessly.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.970
Try to include Sensory-Type ninja in the search teams.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.270
It'll be faster.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.500
All right.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.900
Shikamaru, stay here with Shiho and wait for word from us.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.730
I guess I have no choice since I can't move.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.970
Okay, Katsuyu.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.830
Get word of this to every able survivor in the village.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.230
We'll need their help.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.570
Yes, I understand.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.800
I want to become a great ninja...

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.070
strong like Father and kind like Mother.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.230
A great ninja...

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.830
strong like Father...

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.900
Lady Hinata!

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.670
Hey you!

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.270
I-I'm sorry!

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.600
Hey...she's the Hyuga kid!

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.770
Yeah, she's got the eyes!

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.270
She must be that Neji's cousin.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.970
She's probably cocky too.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.330
She thinks she's better than us 'cuz of her family and talent!

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.800
I-I'm not like that at all...

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.400
Hey you!

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.830
Trying to run off without saying you're really sorry?

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.900
What a jerk!

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.100
Don't let her get away with that!

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.600
Hey, say you're sorry.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.130
Apologize nicely.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.270
Say you're sorry!

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:55.670
I'm sorry...

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.700
Not good enough! Say it like you mean it!

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.270
Apologize!

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.470
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.570
I can feel... Pain's chakra coming inside...

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.900
I've avoided any vital spots and kept them shallow.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.400
But you will no longer be able to move on your own.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.730
Snap out of it, Lad!

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.170
No matter what he says, you must not listen!

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.430
You're the Child of Prophecy!

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.630
The savior of this world!

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.870
Jiraiya-boy and Pa sacrificed themselves because they believed that!

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.930
So you cannot lose!

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.400
If you give up now, I won't forgive you!

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.230
Noisy frog.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.370
Bastard!

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.930
I guess I'll be taking you now...

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.930
Lady Hinata!

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:21.930
How cruel...

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.670
Restricting Naruto's movement with those poles.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.330
I won't let you hurt Naruto anymore!

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.130
Reinforcements?

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.370
Why'd you come out here?!

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.930
Get away quickly! You're no match... I know.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.430
I'm just being...selfish.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.100
What are you talking about?!

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.670
Don't put yourself in danger like this!

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.970
I'm here because I want to be.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.300
This time... I'm going to save you, Naruto.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.970
I was always crying, and giving up before even trying.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.630
I made the wrong turns so many times...

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.970
But you helped me find my way and take the correct path, Naruto.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.530
I always chased after you.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.830
I wanted to catch up to you.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.430
I wanted to walk beside you all the time.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.900
I want to be at your side, always.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.470
You changed me, Naruto!

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.000
Your smile is what saved me!

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.570
That's why I'm not afraid to die...

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.600
if it means I can protect you!

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.400
Because...

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.270
I love you, Naruto!

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.900
What?

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.400
Hinata!

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.770
I can't get near Naruto...

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.300
I must do something!

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.670
I can't let it end like this.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.870
If there's even the slightest chance...

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.330
Gentle Step... Twin Lion Fists!

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:45.470
Nagato!

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:49.800
Now's my chance!

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.070
One more time!

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.570
Hinata!

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.500
Cut it out.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.600
What do you want?

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.900
Hey, he's the kid!

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.330
That one who's always getting into trouble.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.830
The one everyone hates!

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.300
Oh, yeah... That guy.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.770
That guy, huh?

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.370
I'm not "that guy"!

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.470
My name is Naruto Uzumaki!

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.400
I'm gonna be the Hokage one day.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.530
Remember that!

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.170
- Hokage?! - Hokage?!

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.030
Are you crazy?

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.870
That's a bunch of baloney!

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.430
What a stupid kid!

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.300
There's no way an idiot like you can be one!

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.130
Wanna fight?

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.100
Better not regret it, guys!

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:15.600
What seal is he weaving?

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.900
Clone... - No way! - No way!

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:18.770
Jutsu!

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.470
That was terrible... Don't make us laugh!

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.370
Caught you off guard! How's that?!

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.770
I will! I'm absolutely gonna become the Hokage!

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.570
And I'll prove you wrong!

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.870
Why you... Don't take us lightly!

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.200
Lady Hinata!

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.470
Run!

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.100
Lady Hinata... Are you all right?

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.330
This boy...

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.800
Come on, Lady Hinata.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.170
Wait... He came to my rescue...

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.900
You must not get involved with him.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.470
Let us go.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.600
B-But...

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:24.800
Hinata!

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.370
Hinata!

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:28.700
Hey!

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:29.870
Damn it...

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.570
Hinata!

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:37.970
Hinata!

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.570
Stop...

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.570
Don't come, Hinata.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.430
I'm not running away!

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.530
It's impossible to change yourself.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.570
Sure she can! Don't go deciding what a person is like!

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.970
Go, Hinata!

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.330
I always thought you were so negative, hesitant, and weird.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.700
But I kind of like people like you.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.070
I don't understand.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:44.570
Why would someone weak like you try to resist?

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.200
Why fight me?

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.100
Knowing...that you'll die?

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.130
- I stand by what I say. - I stand by what I say.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.870
Because that's...my Ninja Way...

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.200
It was just like this...

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.770
My parents were killed before my very eyes

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.830
by ninja from the Hidden Leaf.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:09.700
Out of love, sacrifice is born...

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.070
Hate is born...

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:17.370
and we are able to know pain.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.570
Yes... Know pain.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.130
What's that?!

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.000
Do you hate me?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.630
What the hell was that explosion?!

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.470
You must all evacuate as far away as you can!

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.000
That is Naruto's Nine-Tails power!

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.930
What?!

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.130
But a Sealing Jutsu should have been placed on Naruto!

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.000
Hinata... She was taken down right in front of Naruto.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.530
And that triggered it...

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.870
Where's Yamato when we need him?!

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.530
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Planetary Devastation"

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.200
This is bad... This is really, really bad!

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.000
HIDDEN LEAF NINJA ACADEMY ENTRANCE CEREMONY Naruto, do you remember?

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.870
I'll never forget it.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.400
That day...that changed me.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.300
Thank you, Naruto.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.930
I'm going to do my best.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.130
I'll never give up.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.030
You will always be...my role model.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.100
Naru...

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:49.830
Man, I'm hungry...

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.170
I guess I'll go to Ichiraku.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.870
I'm sorry...

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.900
I wasn't able to thank you back then.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.000
Tune in again!
