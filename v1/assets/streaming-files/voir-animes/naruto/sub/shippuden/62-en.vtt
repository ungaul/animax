WEBVTT

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.100
That's not fair!

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.430
You're easily using the Rasengan even though it's my secret technique!

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.370
And I had such a rough time enduring the Pervy Sage's harsh training.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.400
Listen...

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.670
- We're just getting to the main issue... - And you can do it just like that.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.900
And with one hand at that...

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.530
And all I can do is spin it around into shape with a clone...

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.330
Man, this is too much trouble...

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.170
Let me try.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.030
Well, let's wait for him to calm down a little more.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.570
I didn't show you the Rasengan because I wanted to brag about it or anything.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.900
Yeah, right.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.200
I told you the Rasengan is a Jutsu

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.970
with only the Change in Chakra Form taken to the extreme, right?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.100
Change in Chakra Form...?

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.700
And...a Jutsu with the Change in Chakra Nature

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.070
added to the Change in Chakra Form...

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.100
For example... Chidori.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370
Oh, more bragging, huh?

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.600
Not only does this Jutsu use the Change in Chakra Nature

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.870
to shift the Chakra Nature into lightning...

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.470
but it also uses Change in Chakra Form to transform it

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.230
into an electrical discharge and control its range and power.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.300
Listen up. When you take Chakra and add in Change in Chakra Form

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.530
and Change in Chakra Nature...

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.200
the attack power of a Shinobi rises dramatically.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.970
Well, there are hardly any Shinobi who can use

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.830
both Change in Chakra Form and Nature, though.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.370
I knew it. You're bragging.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.000
You obtained the wind Change in Chakra Nature in your training earlier.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.770
And you already possess the ultimate Change in Chakra Form.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.870
Rasengan...

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.330
That's right.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.200
Then that means...

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.070
I already have both?

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.030
Well...that's pretty much the case.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.870
All right! Then it looks like I'll be able to get a new Jutsu just like that!

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.370
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.700
This is going to be a cinch!

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.570
If it were that easy,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.100
it wouldn't have been necessary for me to develop the Chidori.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.100
I wasn't able to combine the Rasengan Change in Chakra Form

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.370
with my lightning Change in Chakra Nature.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.030
Phenomenal technique is necessary to combine

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.030
the Change in Chakra Nature with the Change in Chakra Form.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.600
Well, it might be better to say one needs a phenomenal "ability" or "sense."

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.530
I wasn't the only one who was not able to get this far.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.700
It was the same even for the teacher who invented this Jutsu.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200
Teacher?

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.530
That's right...

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.400
Even the Fourth Hokage couldn't do it.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.900
The Fourth Hokage took the Change in Chakra Form

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.670
to the highest possible level.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.270
And that's the Rasengan.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.300
Just a Change in Chakra Form has an A-rank difficulty level.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.100
Even I can somehow copy it if it's just to this degree.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.870
The problem is what comes after that.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.230
The Fourth Hokage originally developed the Rasengan

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.630
intending to add his own Change in Chakra Nature to it.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.330
Then that means the Rasengan was a Ninjutsu still being developed?

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.070
That's pretty much the case.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.230
Any Jutsu beyond that would be

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.770
an S-rank difficulty level or maybe even higher.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.730
Furthermore, it might be impossible to begin with...

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.330
I won't be able to teach you what comes next.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.570
You'll have to discover it for yourself.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.130
Do you know... Do you know why I'm telling you this, Naruto?

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.630
It's because I believe you're the only Shinobi...

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.230
who can surpass the Fourth Hokage.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.430
Well... That's enough talk for now.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.500
I guess we'll start up training again after a bit more rest.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.100
Just what I'd expect from you, Kakashi.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.200
Sure enough, you are a slick talker.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.500
No...

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.130
I really do believe in him.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.000
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.570
The Next Step

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.430
Lady Tsunade!

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.100
We have received a message from Team Asuma!

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.170
It seems...the two Akatsuki are heading for a Collection Office.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.700
Of the locations... the nearest Collection Office is...

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.230
We're close!

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.100
At any moment... we're going to fight the Akatsuki.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.970
It'll be okay, Ino.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
There's nothing to be afraid of as long as we do as Asuma Sensei taught us.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.230
Right.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:21.000
Just kidding. Shikamaru said that to me on a previous mission.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.070
Choji...

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.370
Shikamaru's doing his best, too. We've got to keep it together.

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:40.630
Asuma Sensei...

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.600
What kind of relationship did you have with that Chiriku guy?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.730
What's the deal all of a sudden?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.170
A heavy smoker like you hasn't smoked in two whole days.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.300
You always stop smoking... when something has happened.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.530
You're so observant...

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.430
I'm far too soft if you can see right through to my heart like that.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.400
Well, I can always tell

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.200
what move you're going to make when we play Shogi.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.270
You haven't looked like this since the Third Hokage passed away.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.000
You know that Chiriku and I were fellow members

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.070
of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve, right?

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:34.900
I guess you could say... we were like you and Choji.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.530
You won't stop smoking for long.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.070
I won't stop smoking for long...huh?

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.100
Indeed, that's how it's gone until now.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.900
Shikamaru, I appreciate you worrying about me.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.630
But I didn't stop smoking because of Chiriku.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.300
More importantly, the guys from Akatsuki are good enough to kill Chiriku.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.300
They probably have a great deal of skill.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.970
Stay sharp!

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.070
STABILIZE

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.230
Okay, form the Rasengan in teams of two.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.000
And at the same time,

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.600
incorporate the wind Change in Chakra Nature into the Rasengan.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.730
Well, it's easy to say...

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.830
but I can't concretely tell you to do this or that.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.400
Naruto, you just have to think about it and grasp this on your own.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.700
Okay...shall we begin?

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.130
Right!

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.930
Create a "wind Change in Chakra Nature"

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.970
...with my Wind Chakra!

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.900
That being said...

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.000
how do we do that while creating a Rasengan Change in Chakra Form?!

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.530
That's what I  want to know!

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.570
Damn it!

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.070
That's reckless... He just finished cutting the waterfall.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.300
At just a time like this...

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.470
Umm...I could just say nothing.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.700
But I'll be honest with you... These food pills are really awful.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.500
What?! They're not awful!

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.270
I got creative with this... so they'd be easy to consume...

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
What...?!

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.430
Then I'll eat one, okay?

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.230
I knew it...

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.770
Sure enough, he's quick to tire when using his Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.430
Damn it...

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.270
Let's go!

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.470
Right!

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.500
Incorporate wind Chakra into this.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.600
Damn it!

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.930
This is impossible.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.770
And here I need a ton of concentration just for the Rasengan.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.100
And then having to add the Change in Chakra Nature to that...

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.500
It's like saying look to the left and right at the same time.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.030
Damn it!

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.400
This isn't the time to be throwing in the towel already!

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.170
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.130
H-Hey, where are you going?!

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.300
The bathroom?! I guess it can't be helped.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.930
We'll take a leak together.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.700
This is the Collection Office.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.770
Why put a secret door in a bathroom?

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.170
This way.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.670
Put it here.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.300
Okay.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.170
Hurry up and get it done!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.600
No doubt about it. It is Chiriku.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.370
You got yourself a big one this time, Kakuzu.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:09.730
Yeah...

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.530
Hey, this place stinks.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.070
Let's get going, Kakuzu.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.730
Wait. I'm going to count the money.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.400
I'm never coming to a place like this again.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.900
I can't tell if the stench is from the piss or the corpses.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.530
I'll be outside.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.670
We're almost... at the Collection Office...

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.770
It's almost time...

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.630
Let's get ready.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:35.970
It's all here.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.570
I'll be counting on you... for the next one, sir.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.370
Sorry, but I won't be back for a while.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.100
We're going to the Hidden Leaf to look for a Jinchuriki.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:59.100
Let me give you some advice. You should ditch that partner of yours.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.670
He doesn't seem interested in money.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.830
I know that. Indeed, he has no interest in money.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.730
But nobody else is capable of being my partner.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.870
There's a reason for that.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.630
A reason, huh?

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.630
Everyone else who teamed up with me is dead.

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.930
When I have trouble with a partner, I end up wanting to kill them.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.300
But I can't kill him.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.770
That's the reason.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.570
Concentrate...

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.270
Like grinding the two Chakra together...

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.370
Hey! Tenzo!

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:06.870
I know.

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.270
Naruto...

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.430
If Naruto keeps doing this, he'll...

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.370
And I can't keep stopping that over and over again...

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.470
- I can't... - No... This is the only way.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:54.670
Whether or not his Jutsu is completed rides on you.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.600
I understand...

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.200
The Akatsuki...are up ahead.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.300
Let's go!

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.770
Ohh, it stinks!

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.330
Being in a crap hole like that for five minutes

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.200
would soak my clothes in the stench.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.630
Took you long enough, Kakuzu.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.370
There's no sign of the Akatsuki having come to this Collection Office.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.470
Furthermore,

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.770
it doesn't even look like anyone's been through here for several days.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.870
Have we heard from the platoons that went to the other locations?

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.600
No, nothing yet.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.830
That means nobody's made contact yet with the Akatsuki, right?

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.270
And Asuma Sensei and Shikamaru also, right?

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.930
It'll be okay. You don't need to worry.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.100
We know better than anyone else how strong Asuma Sensei is, right?

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.600
Next time: "Climbing Silver"
