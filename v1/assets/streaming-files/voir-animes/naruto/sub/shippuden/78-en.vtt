WEBVTT

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.230
So close...

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.130
Just a little more!

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.130
Any moment now.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.770
The Chunin Exam...the Forest of Death... three years have passed...

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.730
You want our "Earth Scroll," don't you...?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.530
Okay, let's begin... the struggle for the scroll.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.300
We'll put our lives on the line!

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.270
The Genin who once feared your menacing air

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.600
has now matured, hasn't he...?

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.000
The young Sharingan that child turned at me had a fine look.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.900
If he's able to use the Sharingan to that extent as his age,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.500
he gets a passing grade.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.930
No, with training, he can become an outstanding gem, superior to Itachi.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.870
Yes, that is what convinced me...

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.300
In addition to the trauma he carries with him!

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.930
Sasuke would seek me out for sure...

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.970
looking for strength!

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.130
That is why you gave him a Curse Mark and also took steps

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.200
to keep watch over the Chunin Exam to see how he reacts.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.200
Are you talking about Anko?

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.930
That was just a coincidence.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.800
Well...I was planning to threaten the Leaf, anyway.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.730
If his Chakra was completely sucked out by Yoroi's powers,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.030
Sasuke would be forced to use the power of the Curse Mark...

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.870
Now release it. That sweet power of yours...!

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.130
Dancing Leaf Shadow?!

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.170
Take this!

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.270
I'm not going...to let this thing... swallow me up!

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.070
Lions Barrage!

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.370
Wonderful...

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.930
What more can I say?

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.300
The will to brush off the effects of the Curse Mark

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.530
and the way he made use of the Sharingan in a desperate situation...

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.470
Actual battle does indeed make Ninja mature greatly.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.070
It was the right decision to make him continue with the Chunin Exam.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.470
I suppose.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.170
He did well to improve that much...

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.570
Chidori!

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.600
Excellent... He did well!

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.270
There was no reason to keep him with the Leaf Ninja any longer...

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.030
There's no one who can train him better than I can...

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.630
No one other than me, who can understand the darkness in his heart...

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.100
As well as paint him in your colors, Lord Orochimaru...isn't that right?

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.000
It's as though the destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village was an afterthought.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.330
It's time for me to prepare the next medicine...

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.200
so that you will be able to go through the Reanimation Jutsu in perfect condition.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.000
I will give you a punishment that is appropriate for you,

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.030
who has become intoxicated by Jutsu and allowed it to go to your head!

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.730
I will take all of your Jutsu!

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.100
Stop it!

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.730
Seal!

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.070
My arms can't move...!

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.800
Damn geezer...

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.100
Because of that, my Jutsu was taken from me

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.630
and the time of my reanimation was postponed. But...

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.700
All preparations are complete... and the plan is in its final stage.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.330
The unexpected accident is now but a trivial price to pay.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:27.470
Finally, your body will become mine... Sasuke!

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.430
The Serpent's Pupil

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.930
What's the meaning of this!

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.370
Why hasn't there been any reports from the Anbu Black Ops surveillance team?

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.570
Even though we got rid of Orochimaru's men,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.700
the Three-Tails still remains a huge threat!

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.370
Anyway, send a squad to check it out and make it the highest priority!

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.330
Yes, ma'am!

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.530
Everything I do is for my goal...

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.700
No, I do it to clear away the darkness that stands in the way of my goal.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.200
Lord Orochimaru!

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.100
What are you doing, Kabuto...?!

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.300
Are you all right, Lord Orochimaru?

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.930
I'm fine... That body will be mine shortly.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.930
I will be reanimated soon. I feel great...

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.530
You've reached your limit.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.730
In your condition, if I don't administer a rank 10 medication, your body will...

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.000
I will change medications.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.270
It will just take a minute.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:15.170
That menacing air... But his body should already have passed its limit.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.000
But he hangs on by his sheer will...

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.070
This is why I cannot leave Lord Orochimaru's side.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.900
The Hokage... When you defeated both giant heads of Kazekage...

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.430
And when you were just one step away from destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village...

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.100
The legendary Sannin...

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:41.200
When you were fighting Tsunade and Jiraiya at the same time...

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.770
You never looked so menacing... so full of ambition, even then.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.730
But now, at this point...

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.430
I am fearful of how much you've grown, Lord Orochimaru.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.230
If all goes well, not only the Five Kage,

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.900
but the entire continent will bow down before you, Lord Orochimaru...

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.600
When you obtain Sasuke's body...

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.070
Chidori Stream!

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.700
The report is reliable?

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.530
Yes. According to the squad sent to check that lake...

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.900
The Anbu Black Ops stationed there to do surveillance

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.930
had disappeared along with the Three-Tails.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.070
Hmm...

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.900
I'm sorry. This happened because I was unable to seal the Three-Tails...

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.530
But, who could have done this?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.100
Someone who could handle the Three-Tails in the short time since we lost contact...

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.170
The Akatsuki?!

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.270
The cost of reanimation is this pain. But it's...

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.200
nothing compared to the greatness that I am gaining.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.130
The nature of this Chakra...

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.070
But, I've never seen this Change in Chakra Form before.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.830
Who is it?!

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.170
You came...just as I thought you would.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.530
I have nothing more to learn from you.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.670
Even here before you...

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.270
I think I can become heartless.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:56.700
You didn't kill all of them... How naïve.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.600
There are others I'd rather kill.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.100
Unless you become heartless, you will never defeat Itachi.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
When I stand before him, I'll be heartless, whether I want to be or not.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.800
Orochimaru, you are weaker than me.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.030
There's no longer any need for me to give you my body.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.530
You have some nerve... you're still an Uchiha fledgling!

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.300
If I hadn't been a fledgling, you would've had no chance at me, right?

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.230
You...

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.930
were eyeing me, trying to appraise this "fledgling"

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.600
in the forest during the Chunin Exams.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.630
Move!

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.330
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu!

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:37.900
I want you...after all!

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.830
So you put dibs on me.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:46.030
You thought you had me bound to you with this...

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.900
Come with us!

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.870
If you come, Lord Orochimaru will give you power!

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.100
- Are you coming? - Or not?!

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.300
If this weak guy keeps dawdling, I'm going to want to kill him.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.670
Just try to kill me!

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.800
You're not the only one Lord Orochimaru favors.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.900
We're bound to Lord Orochimaru

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.330
in exchange for gaining powers via the Curse Mark.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.030
We no longer have any freedom.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.770
To gain something, we have to give something up.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.030
What is it you're after?

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.830
Don't forget your goal.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.730
I want revenge.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:54.830
I was ready to give my body if it meant I could attain my goal of revenge.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.130
You just wanted a Sharingan, right?

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.700
But...

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.400
Itachi didn't work out... That's why you came after me, a fledgling.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:10.670
Isn't that right? You who they called the Genius Sannin.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.100
But you turned out to be what they call on the streets, "just an ordinary prodigy."

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.770
You couldn't even live up to the Uchiha name, much less surpass it.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.430
Even the best prodigy is only ordinary against the Uchiha name.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.070
What you did...

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.970
disgustingly trying to approach the powers of the Uchiha

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.070
by drowning yourself in drugs and trying to overcome your body...

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.400
It seems so shameless and comical to me, who possesses that name.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.700
And what's more, I don't like the way you do things.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.330
What is your goal?

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.670
You hopped from hideout to hideout, conducting experiments...

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.300
Toying with life after life...

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.400
Saying you were trying to unravel the order of this world.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.670
You continued to toy with others for your own stupid and selfish reasons...

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.800
Why... Brother?

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.330
To measure my own abilities.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.800
Measure your own abilities...?

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.600
Is that all?

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.800
Is that the only reason... you killed everyone?!

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.370
That's what's important.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.070
You make me sick!

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.130
A snake with white scales... so that is your true form...

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.670
You conducted experiment after experiment

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.700
so that you could move from body to body...

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.900
and that's how you ended up?

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:44.430
Now, Sasuke... Give me your body!

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:21.370
A snake that slithers on the ground can only dream of flying through the air.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.600
You wanted it so badly that you went after the fledgling in the nest...

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.000
But you became targeted as the prey instead...

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.400
By the eyes of a hawk soaring high above in the sky.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.230
Sasuke!

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.070
The way Lord Orochimaru looks... He won't last with only the medicine.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.200
He'll have to do the Reanimation Jutsu tomorrow, or as soon as today...

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.530
Of course... I wouldn't think Sasuke would consent willingly...

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.400
But no matter how much he resists, there's no way he can escape.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.870
Even Sasuke can't resist that Jutsu...

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.430
Next time: "Eye of the Hawk"

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.930
Tune in again!
