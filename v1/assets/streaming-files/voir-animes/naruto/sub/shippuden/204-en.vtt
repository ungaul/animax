WEBVTT

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.440
Kurama

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.130
You're always so careless with my chakra…

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.840
It's not like you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.970
to start up a conversation, Nine Tails.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.680
I know you're starting to get lonely and want to talk…

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.970
but I'm busy now! Let's do this later!

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.510
Do you seriously think you can end this war by yourself?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.720
We'll talk after the war's over.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.220
Later.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.430
If your comrades are killed, hatred will arise.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.630
Are you planning to defeat the enemy

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.260
before that happens?

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.880
And if you defeat the enemy,

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.510
they'll bear hatred towards you…

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.470
Do you honestly think

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.590
you can take all of that on by yourself?

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.380
Don't keep underestimating me.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.510
You don't understand a thing!

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.380
You're naïve!

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.550
Can you honestly take on and erase everyone's hatred?!

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.180
The war has already begun.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.800
There must be a considerable amount of casualties already.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.180
And the resulting hatred to match…

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.430
First of all, Sasuke who used to stand alongside you,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.050
has been gripped by hatred for a long time.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.300
Have you ever been able to do anything for him?

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.930
In other words… Regardless of who you're dealing with,

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.510
you can neither erase their hatred nor take it on yourself!

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.380
So…

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.970
Are you done?

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.760
What?

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.880
Hey…

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.340
You're the one who's naïve!

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.130
How can you be so confident

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.510
when you couldn't even save Sasuke?

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.430
Once you question your own beliefs, it's over.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.220
I will help Sasuke somehow,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.430
and I will do something about this war!

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.510
The little brat thinks he's all grown up, does he?

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.340
Ya know, Nine Tails, I…

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.380
I'm going to come after

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.340
all that hate inside you as well some day!

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.680
You've put me through a lot of pain,

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.130
but I know that it doesn't feel good

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.510
to be at the mercy of hatred…

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.090
Are you stupid?!

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.840
I'm the Nine Tails!

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.680
Some little brat can't change me!

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.590
I am hatred!

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.220
Then it's okay!

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.430
I'm no longer a little brat and

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.130
it will be more challenging this way!

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.880
Later!

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.470
So cocky.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.760
We don't trust you…

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.800
If you want our trust… It's fine.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.300
I have a pretty good idea of what I need to do anyway.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.550
Naruto… I've seen all that you've done.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.300
So you should know by now.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.470
No matter what you say to me, to us Tailed Beasts…

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.380
It doesn't matter.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.800
Your true feelings won't be transmitted to us.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.800
Are you departing?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.840
Yes.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.470
The battle here is winding down.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.380
And we've tended to all the serious cases.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.130
The first and second units have already gone on

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.510
to aid other companies.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.380
We must go as well to support Naruto and Bee.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.800
I'll have to leave their care to you.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.680
We non-combatants can take care of the wounded.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.260
But I'm more worried about Naruto and the others.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.510
The battle there is far more intense than here.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.680
Yes, I know.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.470
But…he's always…

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.130
Sakura, are you ready?

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.380
Yes!

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.930
Please be careful.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.840
Please take care of everything.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.090
All right. I pretty much know what to do.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.720
Okay then, I'll be going for a while!

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.340
Quickly!

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.430
That damn Madara's sniffed out your location.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.260
Unlock the noose Gotta let Naruto loose

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.840
So you were here.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.970
I'll drag both you and Four Tails into me.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.470
This isn't good.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.510
Open your mouth!

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.340
Naruto, get out!

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.760
I've got to get outta here!

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.680
It's not opening.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.050
It's not gonna work like this.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:50.380
Umm… umm… I have to make him throw me up…

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.380
Throw up…

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.760
From overeating…

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.880
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.260
Didn't expect so many Naruto on the plate

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.470
He's smart to make him expectorate

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.840
All right! I made it out!

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.380
Now then…

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.510
Listen! Take a good look at the base of my neck.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.380
There's a rod stuck into it.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.340
That's where the chakra chain binds us.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.430
It's the chain of the demon statue that Rinnegan Gedo uses.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.050
Huh? It's not on the chest?

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.010
The Jinchuriki had it on their chests.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.340
It's because we expand in size

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.550
when we undergo Tailed Beast Transformation…

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.380
The rods migrate to the base of our necks.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.880
And being bigger makes it difficult to find.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.470
You just don't know when to give up…

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.050
Just pull that rod out.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.510
Then the chakra chain won't form!

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.430
Damn, where is it?

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.590
Found it! That's it!

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.340
And the chain binding me should disappear.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.300
But it won't be easy.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.470
I'll be controlled and unable to stop from attacking.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.930
Yeah, I know.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.300
Things might get rough, but you have to bear with me.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.010
Don't go overboard and end up killing me!

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.260
I can't keep up this mode much longer.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.630
I may as well just push it to the limits!

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.010
Here it is!

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.680
Do it, Naruto!

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.720
Why you—!

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.430
It's working!

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.380
Damn Naruto…

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.470
It's not going to go that easily.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.180
What the hell is this…?

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.680
My power…

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.380
Those rods bind anything that touches them.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.430
They're stronger restraints than Nagato Pain's Gedo Powers!

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.130
Naruto!

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.630
One problem after another!

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.300
It has enough binding force to restrain us Tailed Beasts…

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.050
So how will you move?

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.930
It's over, Naruto Uzumaki!

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.470
In the end, it's always the same.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.180
I'm gonna be the Hokage some day.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.340
You just watch!

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.720
I'm gonna take over as Hokage some day.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.970
And I'll be stronger than all the previous Hokage.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.260
And… And I'm gonna make everyone in the village

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.630
acknowledge my power!

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.340
The graduation exam will be to make a clone jutsu.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.180
Multi Shadow Clone?

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.760
Aw man, why? Why?

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.840
A jutsu I'm not good at?!

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.470
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.840
Heroes? That's so stupid.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.300
There's no such thing as heroes.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.550
I'll prove it.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:20.130
I'll prove that there are heroes in this world.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.630
Sorry I was late.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.590
Heroes are supposed to come running in

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.970
at the knick of time.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.300
I'm definitely going to win.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.430
That's the destiny of those born to become Hokage.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.510
You can't just try and become it.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.470
It's something that Fate decides.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.800
I won't run away…

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.430
I'll go forward… I won't go back on my word…

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.260
Well then, show me that what you're saying is true.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.380
Sure thing… I'll beat you and prove it!

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.510
So you decided to be a mentor

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.630
and teach him a jutsu he can't even learn?

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.720
Don't give him any ideas.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.930
That's why this brat who loves to dream,

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.010
started bragging that he's going to become the Hokage.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.010
The brat thinks everything is easy.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.630
That's why he can talk about such a ridiculous dream.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.090
That's why he won't give it up…

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.340
And…he'll die.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.300
Until I become Hokage… I'll…never die!

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.180
Rasengan!

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.550
Someone like you who has no answer… should give up!

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.300
Give up…

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.300
…on me giving up!

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.340
Rasengan!

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.550
Don't mess with me!

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.760
It's far too late for me to believe Jiraiya's words!

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.680
There's no such thing as true peace!

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.930
As long as we live in this cursed world,

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.970
that is impossible!

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.930
Then…

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.010
Then…I'll break that curse.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:25.430
If there is such a thing as peace, I'll seize it!

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.470
I'll never give up!

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.550
You…

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880
That's…

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.430
Those…words…

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.090
That's right.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.970
They're taken straight from this book.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.340
The first novel written by Pervy Sage.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.430
At the end of this book,

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.380
he wrote about a student who inspired him.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.010
It was you, Nagato.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.630
No…

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.300
And…

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.430
the name of the hero in this novel…

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.340
is…

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.180
…is Naruto!

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.300
Welcome back!

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.430
We believed in you!

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.680
Naruto, you did well.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.300
Welcome home!

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.590
Naruto!

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.470
Ya know, Nine Tails, I…

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.800
I'm going to come after

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.300
all that hate inside you as well some day!

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.380
That's why I want to help you too…

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.930
Naruto…

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.130
If you're absolutely serious and

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.970
truly wish to do something for us Tailed Beasts,

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.510
keep doing what you've been doing…

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.470
Not yet…

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.090
All right!

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.050
Hope you can sense this okay!

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.010
The real me is outside… right about here.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.300
I did warn you that I might have to get rough.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.630
Hope you understand.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.550
We're going to push the rod out from the inside!

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.340
Keeping doing what you've been doing all along

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.880
and prove yourself through your actions!

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.220
Naruto… That's who you are!

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.430
Frog Slap!

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.760
It's loose!

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.930
That's right, that's the Naruto I know.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.340
Let's go, Octopops!

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.680
We'll fight as a two-man team with me as the lead!

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.380
Naruto, you just be my back-up, agreed?

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.010
Both you and Eight-o are hurt,

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.300
so there isn't going to be any leading or backing up!

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:51.880
We're going in together!

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.680
Especially since we're both already in two-man teams.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.510
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Two-Man Team"

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:05.090
Hold on Naruto, don't tell me… TWO-MAN TEAM

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:09.260
Tune in again!
