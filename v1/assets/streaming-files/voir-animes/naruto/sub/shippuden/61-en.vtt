WEBVTT

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.130
No, it's not them.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.730
Okay... Let's go!

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.500
Scoundrels!

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.000
This is a problem, old guys.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.600
You should have received a communication

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.300
from the Land of Fire about the temporary curfew.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.770
We thought we could be of use somehow.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.900
We won't be giving in to you youngsters!

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.200
That was a surprise.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.530
Yeah...

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.900
The Old Monk's Prayer

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.600
Using the twenty platoons,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.070
we are currently laying out a search net with a radius of 150 kilometers

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.630
around the border and the Temple of Fire.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.030
Even an ant couldn't crawl out.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.100
Excuse me.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.900
We have received a report from Platoon Three.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.230
No sign of the Akatsuki in border areas C and E.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.170
No sign, huh?!

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.100
Reporting!

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.130
Areas F and G are normal!

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.670
The Akatsuki still have not been found!

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.700
Then...

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.870
Why haven't they been found?

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.530
Have we heard from Team Asuma who went to the Temple of Fire?

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.870
No report from them yet.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.830
Chiriku...

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.230
What's this...?

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.770
You are from the Hidden Leaf Village, right?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.370
Yes.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.930
We were contacted by the monk who is in your care.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.730
I am the head monk of the Temple of Fire.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.530
I had been out of the temple for a while.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.030
When I heard about what happened here...

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.700
I rushed back as quickly as I could, but...

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.770
It was a terrible sight...

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.400
We asked neighboring temples for help recovering the remains.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.170
This is awful.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.270
Where's Chiriku?

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.570
Actually...we have been unable to find Lord Chiriku's remains.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.970
Umm... Captain Asuma.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.270
I don't really want to bring this up...

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.830
But Chiriku has a 30 million ryo bounty on his head

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.430
on the black market.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.870
A bounty...

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.770
If those guys from the Akatsuki know about the bounty...

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.900
Yeah... A collection office, huh?

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.830
So that basically means the enemy is carrying the body, right?

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.800
Izumo, where is the collection office?

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.570
Including the closest one, there are five locations in total.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.870
Now the nearby teams can rush right to the other four exchange point locations.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.600
All right, let's hurry.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.000
Please wait a moment, Lord Asuma Sarutobi.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.600
Please allow me to say a prayer for all of you who are about to fight.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.930
Please...

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.270
Okay.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.200
Chiriku...

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.370
Chiriku...

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.070
Now I'm the only member of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve left, huh...?

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.370
I wanted to talk the night away with you one more time.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.900
There were things I wanted to talk to you about.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.370
And things I wanted you to hear...

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.700
Please be safe.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.930
Thank you very much.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.070
At the very least... I'll get back Chiriku's remains.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.170
Please don't push things too far.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.870
You have a bounty on your head for being a former member

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.430
of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve... just like Chiriku.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.400
Please be careful.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.670
You don't need to worry!

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.530
The bounty on my head is five million ryo more than Chiriku's.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.400
The only thing to worry about with Asuma

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.670
is that he smokes too much.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.130
I wonder what happened with the training.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.370
And here I went to the trouble of making and bringing more food pills.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.630
Nobody's here, huh?

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.730
Sai.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.270
Did you come to check on Naruto, too?

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.470
No, I was just taking a walk to make sure

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.100
I didn't get out of shape due to my injury.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.600
Oh, at a time like this...

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.530
Actually, that's exactly right.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.300
Yes, it's good to be honest.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.600
Was Naruto's training...suspended?

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.630
He probably just went off somewhere to unwind.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.400
His body and mind won't hold up

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.800
if he continues tough special training like that.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.070
Ramen... Ichiraku ramen...

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.200
Yeah-yeah, I know. Walk just a little while longer.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.100
I know. You should have one of these, too!

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.300
What is this...? A mud ball?

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.770
How rude. This is one of my special homemade food pills!

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.670
It's extra special!

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.770
Special...?

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.370
I suppose it's more like medicine than a food pill.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.370
It's filled with nutritious ingredients mixed with fast-acting digestive agents,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.930
all of which I hand-picked and rolled up into a ball packed with energy!

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.470
It works really well!

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.630
And it might even add some healthy color to that pale skin

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.670
while it helps you recover!

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.030
They say good medicine tastes bitter,

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.430
so the food pills might taste a little strange.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.770
But when you consider its merits after consumption,

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.830
little details like that will be of no...huh?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320
Sai...?

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.170
Thank you for the pill. - Sai.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.430
Oh... I feel dizzy...

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.560
This smell and taste are going to make me sick

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.000
before the medicine can work...

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.230
T-Tonkotsu... Look, we're here...

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.230
Hello.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.870
Welcome!

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.770
Oh...hi.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.820
Old man, I'll take an extra-large tonkotsu miso with pork slices...

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.190
on the double.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.800
Here! We have a new menu now!

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:14.820
I want...an extra-large tonkotsu miso with pork slices...

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.130
and extra-firm noodles.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.630
Hey! Look at the menu!

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.770
Sorry, Naruto.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.930
We've made some big changes to the menu as of today.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.560
We now serve tsukemen!

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.030
I see...

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.630
Then, I'll have an extra-large tonkotsu miso with pork slices...

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.400
and extra red pickled ginger...

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.000
I told you, we don't serve ramen anymore!

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.820
Huh?

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:43.320
SPECIAL ICHIRAKU TSUKEMEN

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.800
So that means... now you specialize in tsukemen?

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.630
My daughter Ayame went out for noodle-making training for a while.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.400
And when she came back she said, "Dad, the age of tsukemen is here!

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.600
We should explore Ichiraku's new potential!"

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.130
She gives me this smart-aleck advice, you see...

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.970
The tastes and preferences of our customers change

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.300
along with the times!

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.670
Ichiraku will change so as not to fall behind the times!

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.630
What the heck are you doing?

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.270
And here I was looking forward to... tonkotsu miso with pork slices.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.030
Well, it's fine, isn't it?

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.130
Tsukemen is pretty much like ramen anyway, right?

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.270
No, it's not.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.170
As with soba noodles,

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.370
you dip tsukemen noodles in sauce before eating them.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.820
It's the same thing in the end, right?

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.060
The concept is different.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.670
That's right, that's right!

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:39.630
Ramen is different from tsukemen! I want to eat ramen!

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.690
We've only prepared tsukemen, so ramen is out of the question.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.730
But if you tweak the soup a little

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.600
you could switch it back to ramen, right?

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.600
So you're satisfied with phony ramen like that?!

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.560
Is that all your love for tonkotsu miso with pork slices amounts to?!

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.230
No, it's not like that, but...

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.430
Getting all worked up... made me even hungrier.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.820
I don't...care anymore... Just give me some tsukemen...

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.770
Sure! Three orders of tsukemen!

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.600
Right! Three orders of tsukemen!

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.190
There you go!

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.060
All right!

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.670
Just a minute!

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.170
Huh?

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.130
The noodles are just a tad undercooked.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.100
Boil them for one extra minute!

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.300
Really?

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.970
And check the temperature of the hot water!

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.930
-Right! -You're going to make them again?

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.800
Here you go! Ichiraku tsukemen!

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.000
Ooh! Finally!

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.690
Huh? Where's the soup?

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.430
It might be a little strong.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.870
The tsukemen that was popular in Yugao Village

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.470
was a little lighter.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.000
Let's make the soup again!

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.870
Right!

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.300
What?!

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.930
The first taste is the key!

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.370
We must lavish our customers with the perfect flavor!

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.630
That's the spirit, Ayame! Show me the results of your training!

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.370
Ramen-chan...

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.100
Here you go! Ichiraku's original tsukemen!

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.500
This time it's perfect!

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.500
Finally...

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.560
O-Old man... Can I get some pork slices and pickled bamboo shoots...

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.820
and some fish cake...toppings...?

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.560
Uh, okay. Sure.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.600
What're you doing, Naruto?!

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.030
It's ramen if I eat it like this!

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.820
That's tsukemen! You can't eat it like that--!

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:42.230
Ayame... You're forgetting the most important thing about a restaurant.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.030
Instead of getting all caught up in the little details,

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.560
it's more important for the customer to be satisfied, right?

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.470
That's why I put my heart and soul into making this tsukemen.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.560
It's a restaurant's responsibility to use the best ingredients and preparation,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:03.530
and to advise the customer on how to best enjoy them.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.030
But I want to eat ramen!

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.820
Save it for after you've tried some of the tsukemen.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.470
You'll never selfishly ask for ramen ever again!

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.600
-Thank you. -Selfish? It's selfish for a restaurant

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.190
-Tsukemen is lighter than ramen. -to make choices for the customer!

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.190
-This might be a little more to my taste. -Only serving tsukemen means

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.230
we have absolute confidence!

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.230
Maybe I'm getting old.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.500
-My shoulders get really stiff -If you've got so much confidence,

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.060
-when I do something I'm not used to. -then why does it take you so long?!

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.930
-Maybe I'll hire some energetic youngster -What's wrong with a little wait?!

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.400
-to work here part time. -You'll be able to eat

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.300
something more delicious!

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.930
At the end of the day, anything tastes good when you're hungry.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.430
Thanks for the tsukemen-ramen!

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.100
I'm stuffed!

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.470
Considering he complained about it,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.690
I can't believe he drank every last drop of that strong tsukemen soup.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.300
Although there's a problem with how he ate the tsukemen...

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.170
I guess I can't complain since he had three bowls.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.930
All right, let's get right back to training!

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.730
No, before that...

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.870
Huh?

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.500
Naruto... I'll show you something cool.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.030
Something cool?

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.320
There are some things I want to explain to you

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.300
while we take a little rest after eating.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.230
What? More complicated explanations?

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:16.870
It'll be okay... I'm a slick talker, so you'll get it.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.500
Here's your bill.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.320
Yamato, you take care of this.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.300
What?! Isn't it usually the senior who takes care of it?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.500
There are no seniors or juniors in regards to the men I respect.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:35.690
Well, you're pretty much the only junior... I respect.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.170
But I suppose I really should...

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.030
-Thank you very much! -Oh, keep the change.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.670
You really are a slick talker.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.770
I'm really sick of how lousy you are at conversation.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.800
A nice trip is totally ruined

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.470
if you get stuck traveling with a totally boring person.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.360
We're not traveling for fun.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.090
And I've had it with looking for Jinchuriki

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.560
when we don't even know where the heck they might be.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.620
Put yourself in my position.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.460
I'm forced to go along with all this extra work.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.190
I'd like a little sympathy here.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.660
Just shut up and keep walking... We're late.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.030
Huh? We're late because we're going

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.090
to that Collection Office or whatever it is, right?

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.490
For crying out loud...

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.420
you're making this boring trip even longer.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.660
It's really annoying...I tell you...

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.370
Annoying, you say? This is also an important mission.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.530
Yeah, whatever. You've been left in charge

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.920
of scraping together money for the organization, right?

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.660
A pittance like that would only be enough to pay

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:51.190
for an after-party for Tailed-Beast hunting.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.390
Oh!

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.390
Hey, I'm sorry!

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:07.420
Hey, that body is heavy, isn't it? I could carry it for you.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:12.260
What're you going to do... with my valuable bounty?

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.070
I was just being nice.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.760
You're going to discard it, right?

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.160
What're you talking about?

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.660
I can see right through you.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.760
You want to get rid of this body, right?

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.690
Oh, you got me.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.330
We should just forget about that and get right to the Jinchuriki.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.190
I finally got to you.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.620
You're such a prick.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.720
Hey, hey, hey!

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.030
Are you done already?

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.030
I don't have the time to be joining you in your diversions.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.220
And besides...at some point after this mission is finished,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:04.620
I'll send you to the next world so that you won't get bored in this one.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.030
Not that again.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:12.890
Oh, man... I hope our next opponent has enough fight in them

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.370
so I can let off some steam.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.620
Kakashi Sensei, what're you going to show me?

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:35.030
This is the cool thing... I wanted to show you.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:42.690
This is...

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.160
R-Rasengan...?

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.960
You can also use... the Rasengan, Kakashi Sensei?!

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.720
I can't believe the Rasengan was an unfinished Jutsu.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.600
Adding a Change in Chakra Nature to the Rasengan

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.030
is something even the Fourth Hokage couldn't do.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.800
In other words, I can't teach you what comes next.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.600
You have to discover it for yourself.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.690
No way...

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.660
Hey, do you know why I'm telling you this, Naruto?

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.220
- Huh? - It's because I believe...

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.960
you're the only Shinobi who can go beyond the Fourth Hokage.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.460
Next time: "The Next Step"
