WEBVTT

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.700
The Light &amp; Dark of the Mangekyo Sharingan

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.130
You've become...strong.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.370
The same line as before... and the bird...

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.270
Another farce with your special genjutsu?

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.430
What do you want to know?

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.100
It's not over, but I'll hear you out.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.370
I'll say it once more...

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.270
When you killed off the entire clan,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.770
you mentioned the existence of another person.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.270
So that Uchiha member you didn't kill was a co-conspirator.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.770
Even you could not kill the entire Police Force alone.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.530
So you figured it out...

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.030
Who is it?!

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.330
It's Madara Uchiha...

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.230
With that vision and chakra more ominous than my own...

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.530
It's just like...Madara Uchiha, from long ago...

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.000
Heck if I know...that person.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.730
Madara...Uchiha?!

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.130
One of the founders of Hidden Leaf Village...

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.330
The man who first possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.930
Founder?

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.330
That Madara should be long dead!

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.430
Are you making fun of me?!

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.400
Madara is alive...

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.130
It's up to you whether you believe that or not.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.070
Stop joking around!

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.500
In order to survive, we cling to all we know and understand.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.500
And we label it reality.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.670
But knowledge and understanding are ambiguous.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.400
That reality could be an illusion.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.400
All humans live with the wrong assumptions.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.800
Isn't that another way of looking at it?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.470
Just what are you trying to say?

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.270
It's only your assumption that Madara is dead.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.900
In exactly the same way

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.330
you once assumed that I was your kind older brother.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.430
I just pretended to be the kind of brother you wanted...

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.470
in order to measure your vessel.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.900
What happened that night...

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.730
I was so young and thought it was all an illusion.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.900
That I was caught in a cruel genjutsu...

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.700
I wanted to believe that.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.330
But that was...unmistakably reality!

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.900
My eye is not like it was in the past!

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.830
My Sharingan can see through genjutsu!

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.130
You still speak with such confidence.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.570
But for now, I'll take your word for it.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.670
Why don't we end this little charade?

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.300
Being confident is fine.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.300
But Sasuke, your eye still isn't the same as mine.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.830
Then one day, come before me with the same eye that I possess.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.570
So...you couldn't kill the friend who is most dear to you.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.930
And you dared to appear before me with such weak resolve?

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.570
Then hurry it up and try to kill me with your Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.300
Or is it too difficult to test your capability against me now?

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.330
You're pretty sure of yourself...

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.430
Neither of them has moved for a while.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.630
They're just feeling each other out with genjutsu.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.130
Mangekyo Sharingan... This eye is special...

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.400
From the moment it awakens, it goes towards the dark.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.230
And the more it is used, the more it is sealed.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.200
What do you mean?

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.100
In time, the Mangekyo Sharingan loses its light.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.800
Blindness...

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.130
Is that the trade-off for the power to control the Nine-Tails?

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.870
You did as I instructed and

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.170
read the lithograph in the meeting room?

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.530
Madara... Exactly who and what is he?

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.270
The first one ever to use that eye to tame the Nine-Tails.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.430
An immortal man who is both my partner and my mentor...

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.770
And the only one to uncover the other secret

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.400
of the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.330
That...is Madara Uchiha.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.570
The other secret of Mangekyo Sharingan?

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.270
FOX

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:54.300
It has another ocular power aside from taming the Nine-Tails?

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.030
Yes... One more secret. The most important secret.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.470
Most important secret? What is it?

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.230
What is it?! Answer me!

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.070
Let me tell you a little about the past.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.170
It concerns the history of the Uchiha.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.500
Long ago, Madara had a brother... A younger brother.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.970
Madara Uchiha and his younger brother...

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.630
From the time they were little,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.200
they honed their skills and competed with each other.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.930
The Mangekyo Sharingan awakened in them both...

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.870
and in time, they were considered special by their clan.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.170
Both sought to sharpen their ocular powers

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.830
and competed against each other.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.500
And the brothers...

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.900
They killed off those important to them

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.930
and finally awakened the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.530
It had never before been seen among the Uchiha.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.870
The brothers used their ocular powers to take control

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.430
and Madara became the leader.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.930
However, a change began to occur in Madara

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.030
who had been physically fine.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.870
As I mentioned earlier, this eye is special.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.830
The more you use it, the more it is sealed...

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.130
until you end up with total darkness.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.970
That is the ultimate fate of the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:07.100
The price for gaining power is destroying it yourself,

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.570
losing its light.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.530
In order to regain his sight, Madara tried every means possible...

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.430
yet nothing worked.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.900
He was in despair.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:25.100
Madara became haunted by the Mangekyo Sharingan and sought light.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.030
Forgive me...

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.070
He took both eyes from his younger brother.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.070
Madara now possessed new light.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.300
And...never again did the light fade from his eyes.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.300
An eternal Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.770
It is said that his younger brother's eyes gained eternal light

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.070
when it found a new host...

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.500
And it triggered a change.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.470
A new, unique ocular jutsu was born in those eyes.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.630
However, the exchange of eyes can only be conducted

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.070
among clan members.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.800
Furthermore, not everyone can attain new powers from this method.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.170
That is the historical fact that remains after countless were sacrificed.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.430
That is the other secret of this eye...

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.430
Madara used his power and took control of one ninja clan after another.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.470
Ultimately, he formed an alliance with the Senju Clan of the Forest,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.370
which was touted as the strongest ninja clan

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.570
and established a new organization.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.400
Later, he clashed with the leader of the Senju Clan,

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.870
the future First Hokage, over the course the village would take.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.600
He lost the battle over leadership,

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.830
but Madara still lives with his ocular powers intact.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.230
He formed a new organization called the Akatsuki

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.770
and hides himself in its shadows.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.000
Sixteen years ago,

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.600
Madara instigated the Nine-Tails' attack on Hidden Leaf Village.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.670
But that too was foiled by the Fourth Hokage.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:43.800
In short...

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.170
Madara is a bitter, defeated loser...

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.500
He is not worthy of becoming the best among the Uchiha.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.000
I am the one...

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.000
who shall surpass Madara and become the ultimate ninja!

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.530
And now! I can finally obtain power that exceeds Madara's!

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.570
Sasuke! You are my new light!

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.730
You have my spare eyes!

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.500
Originally, the Uchiha Clan killed off friends

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.470
in order to possess Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.370
Parents and siblings killed each other off to possess eternal ocular powers...

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.070
And they showed off this power... They are a tainted clan!

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.730
And, from the day you were born,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.430
you have been inevitably linked to this blood-sullied fate!

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.470
Now come! My little brother!

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.330
I shall kill you... and free myself from this fate

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.500
and bring about true change!

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.800
I will be free of the constraints that bind me!

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.970
But, we only have each other as siblings.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.030
I'm always going to be there for you,

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.870
even if it's only as an obstacle for you to overcome.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.270
We are each other's spares!

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.870
You've been jealous of me and resented me.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.370
You've harbored hopes of surpassing me.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.900
That is why I am allowing you to live.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.100
For my sake...

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.100
This is the true bond between the brothers of the Uchiha!

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.500
It seems...you are finally seeing what's inside my heart.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.400
So it was all for this...

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.200
My name is Sasuke Uchiha.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.130
There are lots of things I hate. And not many things I like.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.400
Also...I have no intention of saying I have a dream.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:15.930
But I do have ambition!

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:22.870
To restore my clan...and kill... a certain man.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.370
I've finally arrived...

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.030
The moment to fulfill my goal!

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.500
You say you can see my death...

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.070
But you cannot win against my Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.570
Unfortunately, your goal will end as an illusion.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.800
Because you do not possess the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.570
You're still weak...

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:22.130
You're weak, because you don't have enough hate.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.570
You can use your eyes all you like,

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.330
but my hate will turn my illusion into reality!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.900
Your reality...

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.630
is death!

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.530
Even during our shoot out,

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.100
he was able to weave signs for a Shadow Clone!

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.170
You ran it through with Chidori?!

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.030
Forgive me, Sasuke...

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.530
This is my reality...

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.730
Give me your light.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.600
That ended quicker than I expected...

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:42.830
Itachi's won. Sasuke can no longer move...

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.430
All that remains is for Itachi to finish him off.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.500
Do you really think so?

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.900
Of course.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.600
There's no way a Sharingan could win against the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.800
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Amaterasu!"

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.430
Guess we can't take our eyes away from this one.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.730
That's right.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.270
Naruto tosses around when he sleeps, so I'd better move away.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.600
What?!

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.730
Who's there?!

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.030
Akamaru can dance just as well too...

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.400
Now it's you... Tunneling Fang!

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.870
He's half-asleep...but what power...

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.770
I'm avenging Sakura!

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.430
Uhh... This voice...isn't...?

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:41.670
Sakura... You're a man, after all...

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.170
Tunneling Fang!

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.930
Rasengan!

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.330
Cripes, talk about tossing and turning... I agree.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:56.070
Huh?

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.100
Can you lie still and go to sleep?!

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.300
No!

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.800
Tune in again!
