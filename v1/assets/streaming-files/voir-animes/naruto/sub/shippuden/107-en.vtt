WEBVTT

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.670
Kakashi Senpai...

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.830
If there is even a faint scent

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.430
that lingers from Sasuke...

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.870
Yeah...that's right.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.530
No way can we give up after coming this far.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.400
We'll see this through until the end.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.800
Until there's absolutely no trace of Sasuke's scent.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.500
Byakugan!

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.530
Nothing... Please, find him.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.300
Sasuke...

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.070
Yeah...I know.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.730
There's no trace of Sasuke's scent.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.370
Dammit...

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.730
Where did you go?

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.830
We've done what we could...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.170
Let's go back to the Hidden Leaf...

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.770
Sasuke...

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.070
Battle of Unraikyo

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.830
What are you doing?

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.500
The preparations are already complete.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.600
When I look upon the full moon, it takes me back to that night.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.300
As well as...

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.770
the memories I've been trying to forget.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.270
Now I can finally recall things about Itachi...

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.730
Faint memories buried deep in my heart

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.470
are floating back to the surface.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.130
Run...keep running... and cling to life.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.070
Then one day,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.930
come before me with the same eye that I possess.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.070
Wait!

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.730
He was crying at that moment.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.900
I thought I had imagined it.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.330
I didn't realize...

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.170
It seems what you told me was true.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.230
So what will you do?

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.830
Are you going to transplant Itachi's eyes?

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.200
No...

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.600
What Itachi wanted to see, and what I will see hereafter,

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.430
will be completely different.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.770
I can't do as Itachi wished me to do.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.830
I will restore the Uchiha clan in my own way.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.100
Umm... I need to talk to you, Kisame Senpai.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.900
First Zetsu, now you come bothering me?

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.630
I actually thought you were dead.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.170
It turns out that you will be the last to know.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.170
I'm sorry that I had to deceive you, the person closest to me.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.600
Hmm?

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.270
So that's how it was.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.770
I never would have guessed that Tobi was you.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.600
But I'm relieved...

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.230
If you're the one pulling the strings, that makes it easier for me...

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.530
Former Lord Mizukage... I mean, Madara.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.530
I shall continue to count on you, Kisame.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.070
The same goes for me.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.400
Itachi is out...

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.470
And now, his little brother joins.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.830
What an interesting turn of events.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.100
We, Taka, will destroy the Hidden Leaf.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.770
You say that, but how do you intend to go about it?

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.230
We're going to kill the Elders.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.000
The others are not our immediate concern.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.030
If you aim high, the ones below will shield them.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.770
It won't be that easy.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.600
You so-called "Taka" don't have enough strength for that.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.970
Kisame Senpai...

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.930
You shouldn't underestimate us.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.830
We still haven't settled that last game of ours.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.100
This time, I'm serious...

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.830
Stop it, Suigetsu!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.900
Sasuke! You haven't trained them well.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.430
He stopped it with just his arm...!

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.700
Suigetsu! Are you stupid? This isn't the place to...

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.600
My objective is his Shark Skin Sword!

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.200
I've been hanging with Sasuke only so I could get that!

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.700
Sasuke... What'll you do?

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.070
All right...

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.530
Go for it if you want to, Suigetsu.

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.300
You probably can't beat him yet anyway.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.330
Yet, huh?

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.070
Oh...thanks a lot, Sasuke.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.530
Just hold tight.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.170
I'll treat you to some tasty shark's fin soon enough.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.630
The Akatsuki is also low on manpower.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.300
I'd like to avoid unnecessary skirmishes.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.370
Humph. Then you shouldn't criticize others, you guys.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.170
We share common interests.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.970
From here on, Taka will work together with the Akatsuki.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.830
And what's in it for us?

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.100
We'll give you a Tailed Beast.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.900
Tailed Beast?

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.200
You don't know about them?

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.330
I know! It's like the Nine-Tails,

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.370
with chakra physically manifesting as tails, they're mon-

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.930
In other words?

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.400
They're chakra monsters.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.770
Originally, the First Hokage collected several of them

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.570
and kept them under his control.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.870
Each time a Great Ninja War threatened,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.570
the Hokage Hashirama used them to maintain the power balance

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.770
and distributed them to other lands, starting with the five great nations,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.130
as proof of alliances or agreements.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.800
You could call them the ultimate chakra weapons.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.300
It's not a bad preposition.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.700
That's quite generous.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.700
However, if you betray the Akatsuki, you will die accordingly.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.600
Humph...

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.030
There are nine Tailed Beasts in this world.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:21.800
The Akatsuki has collected six so far... so there are three left.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.130
The Akatsuki and Taka will split up to hunt the remaining three.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.100
That is our immediate goal.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.730
You don't have the Nine-Tails yet, right?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.430
Taka will capture the Eight-Tails.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.300
The Akatsuki will hunt the rest. Which includes Naruto...

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.930
How did it go?

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.600
It went well...

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.170
That's good.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.600
Itachi is dead... So our eyesore's finally gone.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.570
And now, we need no longer keep our pact

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.230
to stay away from the Hidden Leaf.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.500
We've waited so long...

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.730
All so we could proceed according to plan.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.470
This is fine.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.600
But Itachi had placed insurance in Sasuke.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.130
The Amaterasu.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:28.270
Itachi believed that no one knew the truth about him.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.100
So why go so far...?

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.300
True intentions aside,

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.570
he probably feared I would try to recruit Sasuke.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.500
But...who would have thought

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.030
that the Akatsuki would lose so many members to get to this point.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.800
We had problems at every turn...

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.470
But everyone made a valuable contribution in their own way.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:56.330
Deidara... Sasori... Hidan... Kakuzu...

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.330
Without them, we could not have gotten this far.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.230
Thanks to them, the scenario is playing out just as I planned.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.330
Most importantly... I've won Sasuke over.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.330
So? Where is this thing called "the Eight-Tails"?

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.830
Don't take us lightly...

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.800
We have no intention of telling you a thing.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
We, the Yotsuki clan, never betray our comrades.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.430
That is- Doubt exists...in a fearful heart.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.270
Suigetsu, enough.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.970
He's under Sasuke's genjutsu.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.200
Shucks... I was just getting to the fun part.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.130
Tell me where the Eight-Tails is.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.070
He is training...at Unraikyo, Storm Cloud Ravine.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.300
Any distinguishing features?

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.530
He...wields eight blades...

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:17.100
And has bull horns tattooed on his... left cheek.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.470
Sheesh... Those eyes of his have improved.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.730
Now he's even more difficult to deal with.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.770
Oh wow... Sasuke's gotten even cooler.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.100
This is a nice place...

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.470
I think I could control my impulses here.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.730
It's calming...

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.970
UNRAIKYO

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.570
You make my eyes hurt...

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.900
Light...

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.370
Noon already?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.830
Damn it, bastard! Screw you, man!

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.030
Training from mornin', stomach so starvin'

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.130
I'm just a rap-lovin' guy

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.070
and just decided on sukiyaki for lunch!

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.300
Yay!

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:15.930
Hm...?!

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.100
Are you the Jinchuriki host of the Eight-Tails?

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.370
No, it's Lord Eight-Tails. Okay?

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.500
Say, "Are you Lord Jinchuriki?" Okay?

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.730
I'm here to capture you.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.870
No. You have to say, "Please allow me to capture you, sir."

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.900
Okay? Right?

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.670
Suigetsu, you take the right.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.830
Jugo, you take the left.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.670
Karin, get behind me.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.430
Hmm... Let's see.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.530
Right in the middle of our conversation...

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:02.870
Here's some serious advice!

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.870
You're fools!

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.170
Fools.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.530
We can't kill the Jinchuriki.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.630
Isn't that what the Akatsuki told us, Suigetsu?

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.130
It's all right.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.370
I can feel his chakra.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.570
Geez, talk about a showy diversion.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.170
Why you...!

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.530
The only one who gets to dig me is me...

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.430
So scram, you fools, or I'll blast y'all!

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.230
You fools... Yeah!

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.130
Suigetsu, get back.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.670
I'm peeking through... And see you alive...

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.870
But y'all are so brainless!

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.170
Stop joking around!

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.330
My thirst for blood is my courage...

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.130
Making me so optimistic.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.730
My blades are swirlin', but my store's a closin'.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.500
Making for a blow-out sale for my performance!

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:08.600
Yeah...

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.470
I've got spare power and my appeal is glowing,

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.630
Eight-Tails the bridge.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.670
Killer Bee, that's me! Ah! Yay!

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.070
Start fighting and you're gonna be embarrassed.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.200
'Cuz you'll be torn apart...

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.870
Bit my tongue...

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.400
Wh-What's with this guy?

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.800
He's totally crazy, but that Jugo...

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.830
He keeps dodging my Executioner's blade...

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:58.870
What is this guy?!

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.900
You made me bite my tongue... Fools!

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:11.730
Are you all right?!

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.030
Yeah...

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.970
I'll go.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.470
Who the heck are you all? Fools... You fools!

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.400
This guy's getting on my nerves!

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:52.700
Who are you? Why would you capture me? Huh?

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.530
We don't owe you an explanation.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:01.830
A guy who talks in weird verses... is such a pain to deal with.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.000
It's to obtain power as quickly as possible.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.030
If you don't like it, leave.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.230
Tsk...

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.000
That's your prerogative...

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.700
I also want to confirm whether

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.370
the Akatsuki's verbal promise is true or false and get it over with.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:25.900
Either way, we're the ones who are going to use the Akatsuki.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.900
Keep that in mind.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.600
The Akatsuki?

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.000
That goes without question.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.330
Y-You are so cool, Sasuke!

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:40.200
I knew he wouldn't let himself be used as a pawn.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:46.300
Well then, let's get to it and silence this irritating rapper.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.770
I intend to.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.900
Your illusions I obliterate, then you all I shall annihilate!

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.730
My true form of the Jinchuriki...

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:46.900
It's a Monster, so watch it now, Host Transformation, yeah.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.000
Eight-Tails will pee your pants, you lil' ants!

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.470
To spear my foes, my glorious longhorns!

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.500
Wheeeee!!!

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.200
Such chakra... Is this even possible?

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.030
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Eight-Tails vs. Sasuke"

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.970
That's his...true form?!

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.970
Hinata... Huh? Y-Yes?!

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.730
That episode where you said, "N-Naruto"...

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.100
I heard it was quite a hit.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.800
Especially among the guys.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.330
Huh?! R-Really?

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.600
You know, that's cool how you can boost popularity

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.500
just by saying names, Hinata!

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.070
Right?! Sakura...

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.730
Why look at me when you say that?

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:28.970
Huh? Well...

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.470
Why this difference in the treatment of heroines?

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.330
If I get down to business, even I can...

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.030
- You're embarrassed. - N-Naruto...

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.230
- When you're happy... - Naruto.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:44.900
- Sexy. - Naruto... - Cry. - N-Naruto.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.670
- Panicked. - Naruto.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.330
- Scream it out. - N-Naruto!

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.300
How was that?

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.430
That's good... Is what I'd like to say.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.630
But Sakura won't be saying lines like that.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.070
So we won't need them.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.230
Huh?! Quit joking around. Cha!

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:08.770
STUDIO Tune in again!
