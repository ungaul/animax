WEBVTT

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.670
Oh, my body’s still hurts.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.700
You can’t sleep on the ground without the right gear.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.530
Sorry! I’m sorry!

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.530
But I guess it’s okay.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.870
It looks like we can get back to the village before the day’s over.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.130
What about Kakashi Sensei?

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.730
Yes, about that…

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.770
I’m counting on you.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.130
Kakashi Sensei, what was that?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.730
Messages to every Hidden Village.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.930
We are working toward a united front.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.500
We have to share critical intel as early as possible.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.370
The Akatsuki possess the Tailed Beasts.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.030
We cannot go on and do nothing.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.070
Besides, they are led by that Madara Uchiha.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.230
We must do everything we can now.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.400
I know that.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.030
Then hurry up and give your approval.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
Are you willing to lose this war?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.730
But the Allied Shinobi Force…

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.900
What if we give them too much power

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.700
and this decision comes back to haunt us later?

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.600
Do you really distrust your own nation’s shinobi that much?

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.400
First of all…

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.600
We will need you to come to a decision soon.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.730
The battery is running low. It is such a long distance.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.770
Let’s conclude this.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.970
Lightning approves this.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.070
Earth agrees with Lightning.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.030
Wind approves this as well.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.300
Why not?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.670
Fire approves it.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.300
All right. Water approves it as well.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.830
So now, with this…

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.030
The formation of the Allied Shinobi Force is ratified.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.000
Monitors on record. I, Tenga, shall serve as the witness.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.730
Thank you all very much. This ends the transmission.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.170
It is finally over.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.030
Now it would be good to contact the Hidden Leaf at once.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.430
The Five Great Nations Mobilize Sakura…

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.000
I wonder where she is now.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.600
Was she able to persuade Naruto?

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.570
Kiba and Lee are with her. I’m sure everything’s okay.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.200
Still… Well, worrying about it here won’t do any good.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.570
Did something happen?

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.630
Hey, Shikamaru.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.130
Can I talk to you?

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.930
Dad?

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.230
TOBIMARU Lord Kazekage has returned.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.400
Did you receive Tobimaru’s message?

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.600
Yes, ma’am!

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.900
Any word from the Feudal Lords?

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.730
Yes, just a while ago.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.330
It said that they all gave their approval.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.400
It came sooner than expected.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.300
Well, considering the situation…

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.230
Those lords, who often act slowly,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.300
had no choice but to act quickly.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.430
Things are gonna get busy.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.070
We’ll meet immediately.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.400
Send for all the officials at once.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.630
Welcome home, Lady Mizukage.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.770
We received word from the Feudal Lord.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.300
Let’s hear it, go ahead!

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.100
Sir. The Feudal Lords of the Five Great Nations

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.800
have approved the Allied Shinobi Forces.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.270
Is that so?

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.930
It’s finally time.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.730
We must hurry to get ourselves ready too.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.970
But it’s a good thing we were able to secure the Eight-Tails

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.870
before it fell into our enemy’s hands.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.670
It’s said that the Akatsuki member Kisame Hoshigaki

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.970
was defeated in that fight.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.000
We were able to weaken the enemy’s might before the war began,

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.500
so that was great.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.030
Just what you’d expect from Lord Raikage.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.930
Kisame Hoshigaki…

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.230
Really? That guy who was called the Tailless Tailed Beast.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.870
What’s the matter, Chojuro?

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.530
No… Umm… Nothing…

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.130
Where’s your energy? Are you hungry, or something?

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.730
I’ve got it! I’ll treat you to a meal after this!

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.470
Huh?

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.730
Of course, it’ll be fried pork cutlets!

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.870
For good luck in battle!

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.670
FRIED PORK CUTLETS Fried pork cutlets…

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.530
HUSBAND HUNTING Husband hunting?!

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.430
I-I don’t care for…oily foods.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.530
How pitiful!

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.330
Keep that up and you’ll fail at the crucial moment.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400
HUSBAND HUNTING

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.070
FAIL HUSBAND HUNTING?! Husband hunting… You’ll…fail?!

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.930
At times like these,

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.830
you should accept whatever your elder tells you.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.770
Shut up, or I’ll kill you.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.030
Well, that was quick.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.600
Those lords worked quickly

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.530
because the Tailed Beasts and Madara were mentioned.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.830
I can understand the Tailed Beasts.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.130
But isn’t Madara someone from long ago?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.570
He must be really old by now.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.900
He didn’t look that old.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.800
So who looks older, him or our old man?

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.970
I tell you. The ignorant have it so easy.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.800
Well, something like war… It just doesn’t seem real.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.230
Heaven help us…

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.730
if all our shinobi are young kids who know nothing of war.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.870
Of course, you-know-who got talked down by one of those kids.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.830
When did you all forsake yourselves?

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.170
Well, let’s just see what the young ones have got!

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.070
According to the reports,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.400
it seems there was quite an uproar at the conference.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.470
It was unusual that the Sixth Hokage tried to turn things in his favor.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.470
The venue was kept secret and security was tight.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.430
Who would have thought that place would be breeched so easily?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.700
But that’s the Akatsuki for you.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.700
They got into the place so easily and threw us into an uproar.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.170
Tell us everything.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.530
It was right after the conference started.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.670
They suddenly appeared out of the least expected place.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.370
Hello!

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.830
One problem after another! Now what?!

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.600
Is it the Akatsuki?!

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.900
It seems so.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.100
Sasuke Uchiha has snuck in!

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:41.530
Now, where could he be hiding?

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.500
I’m very irritated right now.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.770
If you attack, I’ll show no mercy.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.030
I would say the same to you!

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.270
Elbow Bolt!

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.170
Gale Style: Laser Circus!

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.370
Sasuke!

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.000
W-What is this?!

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.230
Gaara… This is even greater than your Ultimate Defense.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.230
Impossible!

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.570
An absolute defense greater than that of the Kazekage?

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.700
That’s what he said.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.930
It must have been a Visual Jutsu of the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.130
And then…

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.300
They made us withdraw

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.300
and they headed for the conference room.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.500
He’s coming.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:20.930
Above?

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.530
It pains my heart

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.270
every time I see such a handsome man melt away.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.730
But you have to die.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.370
So a brat like you defeated Deidara?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.830
Well, I hold no grudge against you, but many ninja wish you dead.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.530
So long…

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.130
Particle Style: Atomic Dismantling Jutsu!

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.670
My name is Madara Uchiha.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.930
Sasuke!

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.130
I have something I want to explain to you all.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.470
And once you comprehend it, I want to pose a question.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:41.470
To think that four Kage together couldn’t take on Sasuke Uchiha.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.470
That is the power of the Akatsuki.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.970
Why did they attack the Five Kage Summit?

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.470
To show off their strength?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.470
Judging from their individual actions,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.770
it is difficult to say whether the objectives of

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.970
Sasuke Uchiha and Madara were the same.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.870
However, it seems that Madara thought, with any luck,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.230
he could take the five Kage hostage

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.770
in order to advance his own plan.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.830
The five Kage?! How arrogant!

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.300
What was Madara’s plan?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.000
He called it his "Project Tsuki no Me."

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.230
He already has possession of seven Tailed Beasts,

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.500
beginning with my One-Tail.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.770
It seems Madara plans to collect

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.170
the two remaining Tailed Beasts and resurrect the Ten-Tails,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.100
the combination of every Tailed Beast,

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.530
in order to make himself the Jinchuriki of the Ten-Tails.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.870
And using that power,

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.600
he would place the world under Infinite Tsukuyomi.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.470
And he would place all humans under his rule,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.370
and he would control them.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.900
A world free of antagonism and strife. Is that what he said?

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.630
Ridiculous! That would be the end of the world.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:07.270
Exactly. That’s all the more reason we must stop him.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.200
That is what the Allied Shinobi Forces are for.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.070
But if that is the case,

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.400
I worry about the whereabouts of Danzo Shimura.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.530
I hear that he was the one controlling the Hidden Leaf

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.370
from behind the scenes for a long time.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.530
I’d hate to get shot in the back at a time

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.100
when we are all trying to build solidarity.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.830
As to that,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.400
every Hidden Village should now be out searching for him.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.270
It seems some of the Mizukage’s followers

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.230
did come in contact with him once, but…

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.800
What? We’re in the middle of a meeting.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.300
Pardon me. There is an urgent report.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.630
Come in.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.730
We have received a message

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.370
from Kakashi Hatake of the Hidden Leaf.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.800
It seems Kakashi Hatake and two other ninja

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.170
came upon Sasuke Uchiha and Madara, and fighting ensued.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.630
It seems they were able to confirm the death of Danzo Shimura.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.970
Danzo is dead?!

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.600
What?!

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.770
Someone so skilled that he became the Hokage?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.600
What about Madara and Sasuke?

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.170
Sir! It seems they used the Transportation Technique to disappear.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.530
It’s certain, the Akatsuki is definitely strong.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.570
Their capability of war waging is unknown.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.470
But the true strength of our Allied Shinobi Forces,

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.700
which is unparalleled in history, is also unknown.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.870
Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Lightning…

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.970
If we unite all the shinobi’s power,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.900
I believe we can counter them thoroughly.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.500
Above all, we must win this battle or the world will end.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.000
Begin stockpiling ninja tools and rations immediately.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.700
All official missions will be temporarily halted

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.100
in preparation for battle.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.500
Give me a list of all shinobi belonging to the village.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.730
At the same time,

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.600
I want each platoon to begin preparing their tactical plans.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.730
No way! Sasuke attacked the Five Kage Summit?!

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.800
I hear they’re about to announce it.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.100
Seems there is utter confusion among the officials.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.130
So it’s true that Sasuke is a member of the Akatsuki,

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.130
who crushed the Hidden Leaf.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.870
Looks like this is gonna turn out to be a drag.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.000
These are orders from Lady Mizukage.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.330
Confirm our supplies of ninja tools immediately!

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.330
Make a list of anything we’re short on!

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.330
I don’t know about this Allied Shinobi Forces,

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.600
but I won’t join up with those guys from the Stone.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.230
The Akatsuki is a hateful group that brought

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.000
the nightmare of the Fourth Mizukage upon this nation.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.570
The Hidden Stone have used

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.170
the Akatsuki again and again, until now.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.930
The higher-ups may order it,

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.400
but there’s no way Ganryu would accept it.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:10.700
You’re being very careful with them.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.830
They are the great masterpieces of a legendary puppeteer.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.300
I cannot allow myself to be bested

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.230
by the generations of puppeteers before me.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.570
What about you?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.070
I just sent off messages

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.500
to those ninja currently on far away missions.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.030
But to think it has come to killing a Hokage.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.000
You mean Sasuke Uchiha?

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.600
I knew it, but he’s really fallen as low as you can get.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.230
But…

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:46.000
Naruto, you told me, "I am going to be the Hokage."

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.030
I became the Kazekage.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.500
If you are prepared to bear the burden of being a Kage,

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.500
then do what is right as Sasuke's friend.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.930
He didn’t seem to be convinced, did he?

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.770
It’s because he never gives up.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.570
He’s the one who changed the old Gaara,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.900
the one we could never approach.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.900
No matter how lost in the darkness a person might be,

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.900
he will hold out his hand.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.630
He will try to save him.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.630
That’s how he is.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.730
Gaara…

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.030
But it’s Sasuke himself who’s seeking the darkness.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.570
This time, I don’t think…

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.030
It has to be Naruto’s decision after that.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.670
What he will do as a friend.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:09.070
I will simply give my all to protect my friends…

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.630
and the world!

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.270
Look. There’s another black Kite flying in.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.400
How many does that make?

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.100
Come on, Konohamaru, forget about that!

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.600
I’d rather know where Naruto has gone!

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.800
It’s a Leaf Hero Newspaper, after all.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.570
I haven’t snagged the all-important interview!

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.100
Yeah. When he and I had that Pervy Ninjutsu contest,

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.470
he said he would come right back.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:39.930
Wha—?!

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.400
What do you mean by Pervy Ninjutsu?!

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.800
You’re so lewd, Konohamaru!

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.670
Lewd?! You’re talking about my secret lethal move!

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.130
Konohamaru! They say Naruto has come home!

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.370
Sakura…

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.470
I’m back.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.130
I heard from my dad… about Sasuke.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.500
Yeah…

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:18.130
And I fought with him.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.230
"Fought"? You mean with Sasuke?!

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.030
I’ll give you the details later.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.100
Sorry, but would you mind getting everybody together?

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.930
There’s something I want to say.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:36.670
Okay.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.330
Naruto.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:40.600
We were waiting for you, you know?

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:41.870
Hey, you guys.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.100
I just need to get an interview from you

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.470
and the Leaf Hero Newspaper will be done!

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.400
Naruto, time for your interview!

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.500
Oh, that’s right.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.770
But I have to make a report, so let’s do it another time.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.930
What? You keep saying next time!

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.270
But you promised!

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.900
You always keep us waiting! You're so mean, Naruto!

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.570
So when’s "next time"?

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.270
– Yeah, we’ve been waiting for so long! – Naruto! Come on, when?

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.430
– C’mon! – Naruto!

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.330
Hey! Why don’t you say something too, Konohamaru?

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.900
I wonder what happened.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.830
Huh?

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.030
There seems to be something different about Naruto.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.970
Huh? What are you talking about, Konohamaru?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.830
There’s nothing different. He looks like his usual self.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.000
That’s true, but…

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.230
So when is "next time"?

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.230
What’s that? They’re fast!

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.270
It’s Kakashi Sensei and Guy Sensei.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.130
Those two… Could it be that again?

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.000
No mistake about it. It’s their rivalry contest.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.330
Guy Sensei probably challenged him.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.500
Of all the times to do this.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.400
No, that’s exactly why he’s doing this now.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:59.170
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Kakashi Hatake, the Hokage"

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.330
What a splendid contest, Guy Sensei!

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.470
Tune in again!
