WEBVTT

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.800
One of the legendary Sannin... Jiraiya is no more...

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.430
If we didn't have this secret, we could not have won.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.800
Let us praise him as our teacher.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.630
By the way... you can come out.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.270
Sure took you a while.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.470
His opponent was Jiraiya, after all.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.800
That was some interference we got.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.500
I'm under orders from Madara to capture the Nine-Tails.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.570
Well then... I'd love to see the Nine-Tails captured,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.970
so let's go together.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.400
No! I'm going to watch another battle.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.100
- What? - Shut up!

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.370
Which battle is that?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.830
The battle between...

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.230
I wonder if Sasuke is okay...

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.800
What do you mean?

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.500
What if the first Akatsuki hideout is a bull's-eye?

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.000
Are you saying Itachi is inside this hideout?

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.970
I said, "what if?"

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.430
This Itachi is supposed to be really strong, right?

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.130
There's no way that Sasuke could lose to...

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.370
Maybe we should be thinking about a worst-case scenario.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.370
Sasuke...

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.370
I'm going to check out the inside from here.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.570
If anything happens, we're going in!

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.470
Huh? Why're you taking over all of a sudden?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.470
When it comes to Sasuke, you go overboard.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.330
Th-That's not true...!

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.900
I'm not going... You idiot!

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.900
Then I'll ask the birds to scour the area

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.930
and look out for the enemy's approach.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.500
Geez... Both of you...

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.870
They're so diligent.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.470
This one's a fake too...

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.070
I'm chasing after Sasuke's scent, yet...

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.530
It seems the enemy is one step ahead of us.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.300
That's why we're compensating for their diversions with numbers!

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.000
We've checked this side thoroughly.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.970
We should report this to the original.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.770
What's wrong, Naruto?

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.870
The south forest only had dummies.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.000
I see.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.070
Why so depressed?!

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.170
You never give up. Isn't that your ninja way?!

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.530
He's right, Naruto!

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.300
All right!

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.930
I'll use the chakra I've restored to increase the Shadow Clones.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.800
I'm counting on you all!

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.600
- Leave it to us! - Leave it to us!

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.430
So you've come...

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.700
Who's there?!

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.500
It's me...Sasuke.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.170
You've grown a bit taller.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.430
And you're still the same. Even those cold eyes...

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.700
Not going to scream and attack like you did before?

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.200
It's just as you said...

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.600
I've hated you...and resented you...

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.170
for the singular purpose of killing you, I...

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.930
I...

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.770
have lived my life!

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.930
Chidori?

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.030
I will kill you!

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.900
Die!

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.100
You don't know a thing about me...

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.570
How much hatred I carry inside me...

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.530
And how strong I have become because of that hatred.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.300
You don't know me at all.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.800
You've become...strong.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.600
Come to the Uchiha hideout alone.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.670
I'll let you settle things there.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.830
Sasuke!

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.530
I told you not to move until you received orders.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.830
Karin said she sensed another chakra, so we were worried.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.170
Feathers?

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.630
Follow me. Let's go!

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.470
Banquet Invitation

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.770
He's coming along nicely. Now...

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.430
Will you still emerge as a snake? Or will you transform into a hawk?

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.170
We shall see, Sasuke...

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.130
The same chakra is all over the place!

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.730
What's going on?!

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.830
Should we change course, Sasuke?

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.200
Ignore it. We'll forge straight ahead.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.430
Good. Taking the long way would've been tiring.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.770
Sasuke!

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.600
What was that?!

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.070
A Shadow Clone.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.470
Naruto, eh?

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.170
What a pest.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.070
Multi-Shadow Clones... I get it now...

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.470
The same chakra I sense all over the place belongs to him.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.400
Found him!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.300
Good job!

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:12.730
Which way?!

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.470
This way!

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.330
I'm not letting you get away this time, Sasuke!

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:28.800
What is this?!

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.870
A humongous chakra! And it's fast! In coming!!

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.870
You're...!

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.800
Only Sasuke may go beyond this point.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.900
It's Itachi's orders.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.100
The rest of you are welcome to wait here.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.670
All right. Besides, we were only traveling as a platoon

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.800
in order to prevent interference for my showdown...

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.270
This will do.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.470
No, you can't, Sasuke!

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.530
Let's take him down and go in together!

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.100
I have no intention of fighting.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.030
But if you insist on going with him, I will show no mercy.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.670
Karin... Stay put. This is my vendetta.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:38.370
Kisame Hoshigaki... And the Great Shark Skin Sword...

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Hmm?

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.600
Have you forgotten me?

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.770
I'm Suigetsu Hozuki, the younger bother of Mangetsu Hozuki.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:52.200
Oh... I didn't recognize you! You've grown, Suigetsu.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:56.270
I don't want to just wait around for Sasuke...

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.930
Will you let me kill some time

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.230
and have some fun with you, Kisame Senpai?!

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.270
Unlike your brother, you're quite cocky, aren't you?

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.230
Maybe I should grind you down a bit.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.900
Suigetsu... Shouldn't we abide by Sasuke's orders?

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.370
Don't be stupid! You blockhead!

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.030
This way, guys!

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.100
Wait! Naruto...

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.200
This chakra...

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.400
Howdy!

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.300
What the-?!

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.130
Well now... How's it going there, there, and there?

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.830
Imagine running into the Hidden Leaf in a place like this...

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.730
I mean... It's two, four, six...

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.100
Eight against one. Such bad timing.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.670
That robe... You're a member of the Akatsuki!

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.270
Though he wasn't on the list that Kabuto left us.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.200
Oh, I'm a newbie. Nice to meet you.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:14.200
Hah! Think you're funny?! Don't waste our time!

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.100
Don't be rash. Study the situation first.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.570
Right now, we have him outnumbered.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.170
Oh dear... Am I being underestimated?

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.400
By you guys?

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.330
So this is an Akatsuki member...

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.500
Another weirdo...

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.130
They keep getting between us and Sasuke over and over again!

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.270
Don't get in our way!

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.830
A Shadow Clone?!

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.930
Just kidding...

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.730
It seems you're more proficient with the blade than that kid.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.800
Kid?!

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.370
You mean, Zabuza Senpai?

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:21.200
My Great Shark Skin Sword was never intended for dueling, you know!

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.800
Same here. This one's...

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.800
for killing!

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.970
Tsk! Have fun? As if! They're dead serious!

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.500
Hey! Jugo... Tell him...

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.300
It's okay... The birds are telling me

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.900
there's no one nearby who will interfere with their fighting.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.500
Geez... What if something happens to Sasuke

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.630
while these idiots are going at it?

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.330
Even the Hidden Leaf are in pursuit!

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.500
The Hidden Leaf have stopped?

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.100
You're so full of yourself!

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.630
Just what can a kid like you do?!

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.870
Naruto...

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.470
Thank goodness... Hinata!

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.870
Naruto can handle the damage!

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.070
Don't take your eyes off the enemy!

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:40.500
Hmm? Are you guys analyzing my strength right now?

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.500
The Hidden Leaf are very shrewd...

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.700
But for a newbie, I'm pretty good... don't you think?

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.630
He's dodged every one of Naruto's attacks.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.330
He's toying with us. But what is he after?

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.600
Tsk! He has a tad more power in wielding the blade.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.200
Well then...!

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.670
Such a monotone effort.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.300
I take back what I said about you being better than Zabuza.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.500
Eat this!

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.570
Almost got you there, didn't I?

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.670
What are you so excited about? Is it your snack time?

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.170
What?!

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.900
My chakra... But I didn't use up that much yet!

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.900
My Shark Skin Sword grinds and absorbs chakra.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.800
I thought you would be more observant.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.870
Care for another taste?

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:53.970
Why you...!

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.700
Now then... What shall we play, Hidden Leaf folks?

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.500
We don't have time to waste on the likes of you!

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.130
He's right!

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.800
That's because we have to go after Sasuke.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:13.030
Shino, you didn't get to go on the last mission to retrieve Sasuke!

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.730
We're counting on you this time!

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.470
Our bond, is it?

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.330
All right...everyone. Let's end this quickly.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.270
We'll go with Formation B, everyone.

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:27.670
Roger!

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.100
- Right! - Yes sir!

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:34.800
Ohh? Seems you're serious. Well, I'd better get fired up.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.300
You jerk... Quit kidding around!

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.000
Naruto, concentrate on the formation!

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.800
Yeah, I know.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.500
Let's do it. Kiba, are you ready on your side?

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.900
Anytime. Right, Akamaru?!

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.000
Then here goes!

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:01.270
Oh my, so high... That girl has such brute power.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.830
Oops! They distracted me with the decoy... And now those three are surrounding me!

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.830
I don't know which one to dodge!

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.370
S-Say, that's no fair!

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.430
- No time for you to look! - Oh dear...

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.670
What...?

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.770
Cha! Cha!

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.330
Olé!

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.000
Three against one?! You Hidden Leaf cowards!

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.300
Rasengan!

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.800
You weren't the decoy?

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.130
You got me...!

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.230
Not!

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.770
Ninja Art! Blockade Jutsu!

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.200
Cripes... You said you were going to do it all together...

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.900
And I believed you!

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.330
Don't stop, everyone!

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.370
Separate and force your way through!

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.630
Oh dear! N-Ninja Art... Umm... Geez!

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.770
What kind of jutsu is that?

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.330
I got it! I'm going to name this jutsu...

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.430
Ninja Art: Whack-A-Mole Jutsu!

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.670
Except the roles for hitting are reversed...

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:17.900
Senpai...

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.530
I know...

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.600
Unless we finish him off for good, he won't let us move forward.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.270
Damn it!

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.130
Say say... What shall we play next?

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.530
We can't be wasting time in a place like this!

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.200
I know that. We'll go with Battle Formation A next.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:01.230
Just a bit longer... You just wait, Itachi!

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.800
My foolish little brother...

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:42.130
So you've finally arrived before me.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.200
It seems you've been waiting for this moment...

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.400
But the same goes for me.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.400
Come...!

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.600
Recreate my death as you've seen it.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.670
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Longest Moment..."

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.300
How far do you see ahead?

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.700
COMMEMORATING THE 350TH EPISODE W-Welcome to the party.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.570
It will begin shortly, so please come this way.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.830
In commemoration of passing the 350th episode...

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.100
Hold it!

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.970
What are...you doing?!

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.800
Why didn't you guys invite me, the main character?!

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.630
Well, you weren't in Episode 350.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.730
Th-That was just by coincidence... Huh? Really?

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.300
You weren't in Episode 100 or Episode 300 either.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.870
Shut up! I don't want to be told by a newcomer like you

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.100
who started from Episode 252!

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.000
For a main character,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.970
you don't seem to have much luck with milestone episodes.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.970
Maybe you're not so popular?

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.700
I don't want to be told by you!

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.870
But having no lines in a milestone episode is pretty sad

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.270
for a main character.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.430
Not you too, Sakura... So here's a toast! Cheers!

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.070
- Cheers! Congratulations! - Damn it!

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.030
N-Naruto...

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.400
Ch-Cheer up!

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.200
You're not helping me here...

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.030
Tune in again!
