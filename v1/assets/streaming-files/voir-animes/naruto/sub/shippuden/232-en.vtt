WEBVTT

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.950
Unlike you guys...

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.950
I don't want to sever any of my bonds...

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.950
or get them cut off!

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.280
We shouldn't have cut them.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.700
Disappear!

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.720
Hole

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.220
Fire Style: Majestic Flower Flame!

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.590
Fire Style: Bomb Blast Dance!

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.010
We're safe!

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.430
If we didn't have Naruto's Chakra Cloak,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.010
we'd be crisper than a roast pig!

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.010
The next round is coming!

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.180
Naruto's chakra has been protecting everyone this whole time.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.890
Naruto, are you sure you're okay to keep this going?

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.010
He's gone!

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.220
Where'd he go?

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.090
He disappeared... He escaped...

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.090
That's impossible. Find him!

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.010
Above you, Naruto!

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.050
Naruto, you're only fighting defensively now,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.180
trying to protect everyone.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.590
Is there any meaning to all of this?

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.640
Are you all right, Naruto?

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.140
It's too much for you to control the chakra that I gave you, all at once.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.140
You'll wear yourself out in no time.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.510
Also, it looks like Ten Tails is charging chakra,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.640
so you'd better watch out!

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.050
You're only growing weaker.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.140
I don't think you'd understand, since you want to be alone...

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.590
But having everyone by my side makes me really, really happy!

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.640
That alone gives me strength!

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.090
Did he run away?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.180
If the pain of your comrades' deaths is part of your bond...

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.470
then there's no need to protect them, right?

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.010
What the hell, you quibbling bastard?!

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.840
That's what I hate about you!

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.050
That's not what I‘m talking about you, quibbling idiot!

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.010
I'm saying I can endure any pain if it involves my comrades.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.840
It means I don't want to give them up!

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.340
It might seem selfish of me...

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.050
But it's more painful for me to not have any comrades in here!

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.300
Obito... What are you trying to confirm through Naruto?

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.640
Cha!

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.840
There's no mistake!

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.470
This chakra is...

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.220
Hashirama!

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.340
Dad! It's collapsing!

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.470
I can't hold it back any longer!

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.050
Damn it, it's repelling this Mountain Jutsu

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.550
enhanced with Naruto's chakra!

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.840
There's no other jutsu that can stop it, Dad!

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.260
Bad news, Naruto!

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.970
The Ten Tails is planning to do the Cataclysm!

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.180
What the heck is that? Cat-a-what?

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.970
Stop wasting time!

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.430
The land's going to be ripped apart!

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.430
It can't be controlled anymore,

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.890
because you cut the link between Ten Tails and me.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.090
Although I guess it's about time I became its Jinchuriki.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.550
The real fun... is just beginning!

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.970
This time, I'll make the Ten Tails disappear!

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.010
Kamui!

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.390
Looks like you were waiting for your chance.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.760
But so was I, Kakashi.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.140
Kakashi Sensei!

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.050
Naruto, you take care of things here!

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.550
Kakashi Sensei!

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.720
Here it comes! The Cataclysm!

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.270
That should have cleaned most of them out.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.810
Naruto protected us again.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.810
Naruto...

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.310
Is that all you've got?

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.390
It's disappearing!

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.520
Nice try pretending to be tough, but it seems you've reached your limit.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.810
You've given me something to look forward to...

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.850
but I think it's time you made your exit.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.970
Everyone! Let's join together and fight as one!

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.810
- Right! - Right!

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.850
Hinata!

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.430
Time for you to recover!

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.390
You guys...

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.470
Such a futile demonstration.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.470
Lightning Blade!

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.720
So there's still doubt in your heart.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.520
You've had several chances to kill me if you really wanted to.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.270
One more blow!

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.430
It's pathetic that you feel compassion

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.470
towards an enemy in the midst of fighting.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.930
Is it guilt?

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.470
Are you feeling remorse over the fact that

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.060
you couldn't protect Rin and keep your promise to me?

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.850
Are you hoping that I'll have a change of heart?

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.520
Obito... Let's stop this already!

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.770
Your dream long ago was to become the Hokage...

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.850
Naruto has the same dream.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.930
Naruto's words are exactly what you used to say in the past.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.890
I'm going to be the Hokage! I'm Obito Uchiha!

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.680
For my Great Stone Face,

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:29.310
make sure my trademark goggles and Sharingan are nicely carved out!

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.930
My dream is to surpass the Hokage someday!

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.560
And...I'm going to make everyone in the village accept me!

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.890
You haven't realized it...

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.720
But you've been trying to merge your past self with the current Naruto...

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:47.390
Hearing the old you in Naruto's words.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.520
Is it because you secretly want to be repudiated by your old self?

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.020
I can't see you not understanding Naruto's feelings!

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.390
You can still go back... to the person you once were!

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.020
It's because I understand Naruto's mind...

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.350
That I want to hear it all...

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.600
And negate everything that he does!

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.140
Obito... By the way, let me tell you one more thing.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.520
This guilt you feel towards me is really presumptuous.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.680
If you believe that I started this war simply over you and Rin...

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.470
To call you misdirected, would be an understatement!

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.680
I know everything.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.270
I know that Rin deliberately ran into your Lightning Blade.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.390
That she chose to die.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.930
Back then, Rin had been kidnapped by the Hidden Mist

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.520
and forced to become the Three Tails' Jinchuriki.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.220
You succeeded in rescuing Rin and got her out...

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.520
But that was part of the Hidden Mist's plan.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.270
They even pretended to pursue you

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.930
to get you home to the Leaf quicker.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.390
How did you...?

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.390
Damn it!

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.560
You all stay here.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.810
Captain... Let's wait for reinforcements.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.600
We don't have time...

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.770
The Hidden Mist kidnapped Rin in order to use her

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.520
as some kind of test subject...

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.430
If she's taken to the Blood Mist Village,

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.470
we'll never get her out.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.470
But you can't go alone!

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.390
I won't be alone.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.930
Summoning Jutsu!

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.600
Can you pick up Rin's scent?

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.020
I remember it. Leave it to me.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.970
When the reinforcements arrive, tell them that we went after Rin.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.930
Yes, sir.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.430
Wait for me, Rin!

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.430
I will definitely protect you!

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.680
It's the Leaf!

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.600
A Leaf shinobi!

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.560
All right! We're going to divert the enemy!

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.430
You guys wait here.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.310
This way, Kakashi.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:12.640
Rin!

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.430
They put her under a genjutsu.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.850
Release!

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.060
Kakashi!

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:27.890
Let's get out of here!

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.430
Leaf shinobi! They have the captive!

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.020
Hurry!

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.430
Don't let them get away!

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.470
Go!

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.060
We'll divert the enemy.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.430
Thanks, I leave it to you.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.430
Save it.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.640
If we're driven into a corner, we'll make a run for it too.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.390
Let's go, Rin.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.060
Kakashi...

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.600
I...feel strange...

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.640
We have to escape first.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.810
Scatter!

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.430
I feel it...

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.270
I feel like there's someone, something else inside me.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.720
What are you talking about?

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.770
I don't know.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.930
- There they are! - Don't let them get away!

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.020
We have to get past them!

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.020
The Hidden Mist tried to perform some kind of ritual on me.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.770
A special ritual.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.060
But I lost consciousness and...

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.390
They're persistent!

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.060
I can't return to the Leaf Village!

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.470
What are you saying?!

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.600
Kakashi, you have to kill me now!

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.560
What are you saying, Rin?!

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.310
They're using me.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.720
If I return, Hidden Leave Village may be attacked!

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.560
I promised Obito that I would protect you!

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.430
I can't do such a thing!

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.640
There's got to be a way out of this!

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.220
In any case, we need to make it to the village!

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.310
No, Kakashi... I'll stop them.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520
Now go!

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.600
I can't...

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.520
Once Rin made it back to the Leaf,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.970
the Hidden Mist intended to make the Three Tails rampage

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.720
and attack the village.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.600
Rin realized this...

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.390
And took advantage of the Lightning Blade you aimed at the enemy...

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.100
to commit suicide.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.600
She made up her mind to die at the hands of the one she loved.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.560
In order to protect the Hidden Leaf.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.890
No matter what you say,

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.680
to me, you're still an impostor who couldn't protect Rin.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.810
To me, Rin is someone who wasn't supposed to die.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.560
So Rin dead is also an impostor.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.560
Rin is Rin because she is alive!

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.770
The things that created all these circumstances...

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.640
The system of shinobi, village, and the shinobi themselves...

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.470
What caused me to despair, is this world itself.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.060
This counterfeit world!

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.640
Remember Naruto's words?

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.890
That it's most painful

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.930
not to have real comrades inside one's heart?

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.430
I quoted exactly what you said long ago to him...

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.100
I know the old you would have resonated with that.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.390
And I still believe the current you, can as well-!

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.390
Look!

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.890
There's nothing in my heart!

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.640
I don't even feel pain anymore.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.640
Don't feel so guilty, Kakashi.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.390
This hole was opened by this hellish world.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.430
In the past, all I felt was pain here.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.430
What's the meaning in that?

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.850
So I abandoned everything.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.470
You've been suffering all this time, haven't you?

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.060
As you stood at Rin's grave... and at my grave.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:42.770
Kakashi...

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.640
Enough already.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.720
You don't have to suffer anymore.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.020
Rin is here.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.890
I love you, Kakashi.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.100
Along with your ideal version of me.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.390
I'm gonna be Hokage!

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.770
You can wish for whatever you want...

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.520
You can have anything you desire in this Genjutsu World.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.180
The hole in your heart can be filled immediately.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.640
Rin is gone.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.690
You are still alive!

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.470
Do you really think that something like this

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.270
can fill that hole in your heart?

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.430
Don't erase the memories of the real Rin!

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.310
Rin sacrificed herself to protect and save the village!

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.180
You can try and fill that hole with delusions all by yourself...

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.390
But that hole will never be filled!

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.730
It's transforming again!

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.550
What's your issue with a Genjutsu World?

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.550
Reality is cruel.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.970
This hole is only going to get bigger.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.130
Things don't always go the way you want.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.260
Nor does help always get there in time.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.220
Just like how it was with me!

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.720
Just like how I couldn't get there in time!

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.800
Next time on Naruto Shippuden:

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.680
“Something to Fill the Hole”

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.220
Wouldn't you agree, Kakashi?

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:08.800
SOMETHING TO FILL THE HOLE Tune in again!
