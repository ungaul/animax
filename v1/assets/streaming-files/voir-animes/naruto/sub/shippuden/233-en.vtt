WEBVTT

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.710
Something to Fill the Hole

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.380
Everyone! Let's join together and fight as one!

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.340
- Right! - Right!

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.460
Hinata!

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.920
Time for you to recover!

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.130
You guys...

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.210
Such a futile demonstration.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.420
It's transforming again!

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.500
No, it's only reverting to its original form.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.420
That was only its attack form.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.170
However...

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.960
It's just one stage away from its final transformation.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.670
Naruto's still recovering,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.590
and Nine Tails is infusing chakra right now.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.840
Right now, it's up to us, Bee!

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.920
Right. We'll show everyone the way!

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.500
Listen to me, Bee...

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.750
If we let it undergo its final transformation, we've lost.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.840
We must stop it now!

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.460
Ten Tails isn't holding back...

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.840
It probably got impatient

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.710
after seeing the same Tailed Beasts inside Naruto!

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.500
The fun's just beginning, but it looks like I need to move soon.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.960
It's getting bigger and bigger.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.040
I- Is it after Naruto?

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.500
Honestly, how're we going to stop that thing

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.130
without Naruto's chakra?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.920
We can't waver after coming this far!

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.460
Naruto is putting everything into doing what has to be done.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.750
It's even more painful for me... not to have any comrades in here!

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.750
Naruto's words just now made it clear!

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.540
Yeah. He's been going out of his way

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.840
even to protect shinobi like us...

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.040
That's not what I was talking about!

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.630
He's told us that

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.750
he considers all of us his comrades from the bottom of his heart.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.000
Comrades...

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.590
Comrades...

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.630
- We're... - That's right, I'm his...

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.790
- Me, too... - That's right, we all are...

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.630
We all are...

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.460
Yeah.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.710
We're comrades!

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.290
Comrades!

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.380
Comrades!

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.840
I'll fully heal Naruto!

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.420
We have to do what we have to do!

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.540
If we're going to die anyway,

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.710
we might as well go down...

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.000
fighting to the best of our abilities!

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.000
Ino!

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.960
I want you to link me with someone!

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.670
You've got a plan, haven't you?

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.670
I knew you would come through, Shikamaru!

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.460
Isn't there anything we can do, Dad?

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.380
I don't have enough chakra.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.590
Kitsuchi! Please hear me out!

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.670
You're Shikaku's child...

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.790
Teach me the signs to an easy Earth Style Barrier

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.920
that even non-Stone Ninja can perform!

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.630
One that anyone could perform would be too weak!

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.960
It would be better to...

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.290
No, it's crucial that everyone be able to produce it.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.790
If the enemy has quality, we've got quantity.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.340
But these walls will be blown away quickly.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.670
Even if they are

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.790
if we keep creating more, they'll act like a shield.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.380
We're going to slow that thing's momentum

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.000
with many weak walls rather than try to stop it with one powerful one!

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.960
Of course, I intend to have all of you from the Hidden Stone

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.670
build me a super wall as well...

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.340
I see... Your idea might be worth a try.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.290
All right, these are the hand signs!

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.790
Before we start...

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.960
Master Bee!

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.500
While everyone is building barriers,

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.040
I want you to bombard that thing with Tailed Beast Bombs

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.130
to shift its trajectory upwards.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.750
Ino...

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.540
Next, I want you to link me

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.590
with every shinobi here on the battlefield.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.840
Can you do it?

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.590
Doesn't matter, I will do it!

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.460
What's your issue with a Genjutsu World?

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.790
Reality is cruel.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.750
This hole is only going to get bigger.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.250
Things don't always go the way want them.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.590
Nor does help always get there in time.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.170
Just like how it was with me!

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.380
Just like how I couldn't get there in time!

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.380
Wouldn't you agree, Kakashi?

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.590
How are you going to seal this hole by staying in this world?!

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.750
I may be trash as a shinobi, but I've learned a few things.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.840
The hole in one's heart gets filled by others around you.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.290
Friends won't flock to someone who abandons

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.590
the memory of his friends and gives up on the world...

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.670
Just because things don't go the way he wants them to.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.420
That won't help fill the hole in your heart.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.540
And people don't help those who run away and do nothing.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.340
As long as you don't give up, there will always be salvation.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.290
No matter what you do...

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.130
It's over.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.840
- Earth Style Barrier! - Earth Style Barrier!

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.920
Here it comes, Bee!

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.210
Let's go!

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.500
Its power is off the charts!

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.000
It's more powerful than I thought.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.090
At this rate...

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.500
The last barrier...!

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.500
Lord Bee!

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.710
All your tedious whitewashing!

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.630
One can only achieve true happiness by abandoning reality

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.840
and ridding yourself of the memories of your comrades!

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:03.130
In the ninja world, those who break the rules are scum.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:09.290
But...those who abandon their friends are worse than scum.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.790
And...those who don't care about their friends' feelings...

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.290
are even worse scum!

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.090
It vanished...?

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.920
I won't abandon my memory of the old you.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.420
Even if it's the current you who's repudiating it.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.670
Am I late?

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.250
Nope.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.590
Right on time, Dad!

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.650
FOURTH HOKAGE Who...?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.480
Who's...?

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.810
My name's Minato Namikaze.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.860
Brace for an impending explosion.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.610
What is that?

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.560
What?

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.310
I sent Ten Tails' attack back toward the sea.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.810
- What's that?! - Is it an attack?!

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.730
Watch out!

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.560
What the hell's going on?!

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.190
What just happened?!

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.310
That shock wave came out of nowhere!

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.520
What's with that?!

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.810
Stop complaining!

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.940
We're lucky that we got off that easily!

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.520
He has Reanimation eyes!

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.610
Wh-Who are you?

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.610
Relax. I'm an ally.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.690
Thanks for healing Naruto!

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.770
Are you...

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.060
Naruto's girlfriend?

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.360
Huh?

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.150
Hmm...

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.860
Uh-huh... Yeah!

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.480
I suppose you could say that.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.440
You keep quiet!

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.270
Don't waste your energy talking!

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.860
You're supposed to be healing me, but I just suffered more damage...

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.270
I'll heal the extra damage too!

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.560
She reminds me a little of Kushina...

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.520
Please go easy on my son.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.690
So, why did this happen so suddenly?

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.610
It seems like you knew.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.060
I sensed his chakra when I was in Nine Tails Mode.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.690
The others should be arriving soon...

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.690
Something's coming!

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.270
Minato, you're as fast as ever!

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.810
Lord Third Hokage?!

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.440
And also... That's the...!

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.400
Fourth...

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.690
You're better at teleporting than I am!

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.520
All right, let's do this!

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.520
No way!

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.560
I don't believe it...

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.480
Lords First...

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.020
Second...

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.650
Third...

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.690
and even Lord Fourth...

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.520
Minato!

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.980
So you're the ones who stopped the attack, Lords Hokage!

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.520
But who reanimated you?

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.730
Orochimaru summoned us.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.060
We need to stop this war quickly.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.610
What? Didn't Orochimaru die?

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.270
This is amazing!

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.440
The previous Hokage are going to join us in battle!

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.860
Now that's reassuring!

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.560
I don't know what's going on anymore...

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.020
There's still more help coming,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.690
but they're taking a little longer.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.900
I've been waiting for you, Hashirama!

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.480
I'll deal with you later!

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.520
I have to stop the Ten Tails first!

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.110
He hasn't changed a bit.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.150
We're never on the same page.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:29.810
After all...

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.480
It's charging towards us...

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.520
You've done well, Naruto.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.480
Take a little break.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.560
Your friend will be here soon.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:47.730
He's our ally too.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.610
He is?

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.520
This presence...

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.520
It's Minato... What's going on?

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.690
My fellow Hokage, let's go!

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.650
Second and Third, stand in front of me.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.020
That's exactly like Naruto's...

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.520
I never imagined Minato would too!

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.520
See! You see!

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.860
Isn't my dad awesome?!

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.690
I know that better than you!

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.650
Reaper Death Seal!

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.060
Let's put our trust in this child!

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.020
He's our son, after all!

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:53.940
Seal!

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.480
After all, he's the one who split me up before sealing me away!

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.900
THIRD HOKAGE

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.610
Have you already placed your markers?

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:13.560
Yes.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.150
You're quick at striking too!

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.110
He vanished!

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480
Let's go!

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.860
Ninja Art...

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.520
- Four Crimson Ray Formation! - Four Crimson Ray Formation!

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.980
And...I'll just add on...

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.730
Sage Art: Gracious Deity Gates!

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.110
Ten Seals!

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.730
A red barrier?!

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.440
It's said to be dozens of times more powerful

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.610
than the Four Purple Flames Formation!

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.190
It's a barrier that requires

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.980
four Hokage-class shinobi together to create!

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.650
It won't be able to move so easily now.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.860
You sure took your time getting here, Sasuke.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.230
Sasu...ke?

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.520
Is that you, Sakura?

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.480
S-Sasuke! Why?!

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.060
S-Sasuke!

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.560
Hey, Ino! Stop!

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.150
He's an enemy!

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.770
Ino... You better keep your distance!

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.360
You're all still as noisy as ever!

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:18.110
Why the hell are you here, bastard?!

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.730
Why are you here, Sasuke?

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.610
A lot of things have happened.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.520
I've decided to protect Leaf Village.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.060
And then, I'll...

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.690
become Hokage.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:46.610
What?!

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.230
You can't just come back all of a sudden

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.230
and crack a lame joke like that, you Rogue Ninja!

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.770
Do you even know what it means to be Hokage?

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.400
I don't know what happened to you, but that's not possible.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.190
Do you even realize what you're saying?

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:05.060
Do you think we can just forget all the things you've done?

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.230
Yeah, I realize you probably can't.

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:13.730
But... it doesn't matter what you guys think of me.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.860
All of the previous Kage created these current circumstances.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.190
So I will become Hokage and change the village.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.360
You don't become Hokage

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.440
in order to be acknowledged by the village.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.060
The one who is acknowledged by everyone,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.310
is the one who becomes Hokage.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.940
I leave Sasuke to you.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560
Leave it to me.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.270
I'm going to be Hokage!

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.560
I'm glad there's so much interest in becoming Hokage...

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.230
But you guys are taking too much time!

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.230
Start infusing chakra right now!

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.610
We'll take down Ten Tails with an all-out attack!

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.020
Thanks for healing me, Sakura!

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.650
Now it's your turn to get some rest.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.860
Let's go, Sasuke!

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.480
Sakura?

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.520
So do you see me as some sort of weak woman

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.770
who can't keep up with you two?

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.020
Do you think Lady Tsunade would be the only one

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.650
out of the Legendary Sannin to inadequately train her student?

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.690
I'm almost there...

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.560
I'll be at full capacity in a little bit.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.310
Then I can output my true power.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.900
Just like you, I'm a member of Team 7...

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.560
and I'm a student of one of the Legendary Sannin!

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.560
Okay then!

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:05.860
Team 7 is finally back!

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.060
Let's go, Sakura! Sasuke!

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.020
Right!

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.610
Yeah!

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.400
That sight sure brings back memories, doesn't it, Shikamaru?

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.650
Well, if he's willing to help us defeat the enemy,

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.520
I won't turn him away.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.860
Even tho' I don't want to accept him...

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.520
It's been a long time since our class has been back together.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.980
I haven't felt like this since the Chunin Exam.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.560
I'm going to become Hokage!

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.900
Hey, are you guys even listening?!

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.690
Kiba, no one's paying attention right now... and it's pitiful.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.940
Stop it.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.520
It's because the impact of Sasuke's sudden appearance

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.810
and his declaration to become Hokage are much too great.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.480
Kiba, I heard you!

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.770
We should all aspire to become Hokage!

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.690
Let's show them what we're made of, ya know!

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.270
Ever since I was a genin,

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.110
I thought I was a full-fledged kunoichi.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.480
But I ended up hiding behind Sasuke and Naruto.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.610
I hated the way I was.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.940
I swore then, that next time,

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.020
I would make them stare at my back!

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.980
And now finally, I...

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.900
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Team 7 Assemble!"

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:01.690
Cha!

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.700
TEAM 7 ASSEMBLE!

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.610
Tune in again!
