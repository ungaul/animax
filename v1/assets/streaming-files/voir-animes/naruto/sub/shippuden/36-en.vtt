WEBVTT

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.830
Resembles Sasuke, huh...?

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.270
I guess there's a small resemblance, but...

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.370
What is it?

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.970
He kind of talks like...him too...

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.700
Please don't stare at me like that...

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.830
I'll pound you.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.270
Hey! You tick me off with everything you say!

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.770
He doesn't resemble Sasuke at all!

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.200
I don't really mean it.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.470
You liar!

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.670
I'm just trying to portray myself like that kind of character.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.300
Portray yourself...?

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.000
Then you do  mean it!

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.070
You won't do at all!

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.070
You really tick me off!

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.530
Hey! Hey! Don't act like that...

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.300
in front of your captain, Naruto.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.600
I'm sure Kakashi taught you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.700
that trust and teamwork are most important to a team.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.470
You were on the same team as the great Kakashi...

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.700
Make-Out Paradise Deluxe Edition

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.630
What's your problem?

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.300
He's not a member of Team Kakashi!

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.130
The other member of our Team Kakashi is...

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.570
Sasuke!

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.730
This guy was just chosen to cover the loss of Sasuke...

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.400
I don't acknowledge him as a team member...

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.000
Well...

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.030
That's actually easier for me.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.700
He betrayed the Leaf

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.270
and ran off to serve Orochimaru...

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.070
I don't want to be lumped together with a cockroach along the same lines...

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.600
as Orochimaru.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.200
Y-You creep!

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.200
Teamwork is indeed important.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.300
Sai... Naruto still doesn't know you very well.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.100
So he may have been out of line.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.000
I'm sorry...

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.570
Please forgive Naruto...

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.100
Sakura...

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.700
Thank goodness I've got at least one kid who's less objectionable.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.270
It's okay. It doesn't bother me.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.230
Really? Thank goodness.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.930
The Fake Smile I wonder if they're getting along...

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.770
The new Team Kakashi, that is.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.430
I'm sure it'll work out.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.000
They're not rookies anymore.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.600
They're full-fledged Shinobi now.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.530
But it seems Naruto and the new team member Sai...

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.400
aren't really getting along very well.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.500
And who's fault was it that a team member Naruto can't get along with

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.370
was added to Team Kakashi?!

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.100
I-I never thought one of Lord Danzo's subordinates

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.670
would end up joining their team...

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.400
There's no time for excuses! Get a move on!

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.800
Find out about Danzo's intentions and Sai's background!

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.800
Got it, Shizune?!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.270
Y-Yes, ma'am.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.300
I've left the Naruto and Sai matter to Sakura.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.900
She should be able to set things right!

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.900
About that Sakura...

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.700
What is it?!

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.530
N-No, it's nothing.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.270
I get the feeling...

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.500
Sakura's becoming more and more like Lady Tsunade these days...

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.630
I hope she can mediate between Naruto and Sai all right.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.930
Surely she isn't throwing gas on the fire...

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.970
What--?!

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.300
You don't have to...forgive me.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.170
You tricked me good... with your fake smile earlier...

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.630
And here you don't even know anything about Sasuke...

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.530
Don't you ever speak ill about him!

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.730
If you insult Sasuke again,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.170
I won't hold back.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.600
Fine... I won't say anything like that in front of you again.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.330
So that's another way of using a fake smile, huh...?

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.070
I'll remember that.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.500
How can you grin like that after getting punched?!

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.970
A smile is the best way to get through a tough situation.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.930
Even if it's a fake smile.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.900
Surprisingly enough, everyone gets fooled.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.500
That's what it said in the book.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.070
It seems it doesn't really work if I do it, though.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.670
You jerk!

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.170
Four-Pillar Prison Jutsu!

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.800
I'll really toss you guys into this cell if you keep fighting.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.770
We don't have much time until we get to the Tenchi Bridge.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.900
That being said...

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.100
we've still got enough time to take a little detour.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.330
Th-This is...

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.730
This is the secret Jutsu that only the First Hokage could use...

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.700
The Wood Style Ninjutsu!

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.570
How come Captain Yamato can use the Wood Style Ninjutsu?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.570
Who the heck is this guy...?

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.700
As your peacemaker, I offer you this suggestion.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.070
In order to improve your rapport,

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.830
I can toss you guys into this cell for a full day

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.330
or we can stay at a hot spring inn for a night.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.630
Which would you prefer?

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.170
You guys probably don't really know me all that well.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.900
I prefer the kind and gentle approach,

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.770
but I'm not against controlling you by fear either.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:58.270
Sure enough, getting naked together like this is a great way to bond, isn't it?!

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.000
Don't you think so?

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.970
Y-Yes, that's right!

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.830
His eyes are totally scary!

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.930
He's already controlling us with fear...

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.070
Oh... So you do have "equipment," after all.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.200
Don't be looking!

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.500
Naruto...?

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.930
Shut up with all that talk about my "equipment!"

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.200
For crying out loud, Naruto... You're talking too loud!

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.700
You jerk!

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.600
It's your fault I'm being laughed at...

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.770
Aren't you glad that Sakura's pleased, too?

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.370
Sakura...?

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.370
Now then...

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.800
I'm getting out now.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:21.000
Before that, let me tell you an interesting story, Naruto.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:28.730
When Master Jiraiya was young, there was one time when he almost died.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.230
He broke six ribs and both arms, and several of his internal organs ruptured...

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:40.700
It seems Lady Tsunade beat him up real good with her incredible strength...

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.930
This happened because he did what you're now...

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.670
attempting to do...

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.400
I wonder what Sakura would do....

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.600
It looks like things are going to get busy...

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.070
Come in.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.570
Excuse me.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.770
Shall I start preparing your meals?

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.530
Yes, please.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.500
I'll bring them right away then.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.530
That was a nice bath.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.500
Naruto...

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.100
I'll be getting out, too...

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.130
Please be careful not to stay in the water too long. You'll get dizzy.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.730
Idiot, idiot, are you an idiot?

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.870
I've never seen such magnificent food!

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.870
Man, it sure looks good...

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.030
Say! Say! Captain Yamato!

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.700
What is it, Naruto?

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.530
Is it really okay if we eat all this?

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.000
Sure. Help yourself.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.670
Yes! Thank you!

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.700
Thank you.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.830
What should I start with...?

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.370
Mmm, tasty!

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.930
It really  is good.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.600
If we get food this awesome every mission,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.400
Captain Yamato can stay with us forever!

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.100
Yeah, that's right.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.370
Let's have Kakashi Sensei stay in the hospital a little while longer.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.030
Umm...when can I eat...?

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.070
For awhile, you'll only get food intravenously.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.700
You still can't move your arms and legs freely, after all...

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.130
Oh, I see...

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.600
Once you can move your arms and legs, you'll go on a liquid diet.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.470
It'll still be quite awhile before you can eat solid food.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.630
I want to...eat something...

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.830
I'm stuffed...

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.830
Thank you for the meal.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.370
Thank you.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.000
Now then, normally after dinner,

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.630
I'd want to have a meeting regarding the mission...

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.830
But the reason why we're staying here

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.330
is for improvement of your rapport.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.170
Let's forget about the serious stuff for now.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.330
Now you're talking, Captain Yamato.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.200
Instead we'll definitely have a meeting tomorrow!

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.430
Could it be we're going to stay at a hot springs inn tomorrow, too?

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:04.330
No, cut me some slack on that one. My wallet won't make it.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.230
Then could it be that you're paying for this place

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.000
out of your own pocket, Captain Yamato?

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:10.230
Yes.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.670
Awesome! You're sure generous!

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:20.470
It's settled! Captain Yamato will be the captain of Team Kakashi!

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.070
Yeah! I second that!

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.370
I sure slept well.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.130
The weather's nice today, too.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:53.870
Sai...

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.830
What's he doing over there...?

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.500
Oh, Sai. So you draw, huh?

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:40.700
Is there something you want?

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.930
Nothing special. I was just thinking that surprisingly enough,

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.170
you've got a sensitive side despite being so foul-mouthed.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.830
You really just haven't finished hitting me, have you?

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.230
No way. Hey, I just came to have a peek at what you're drawing.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.170
I see.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.570
But it's strange.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:59.100
I totally thought you were drawing a landscape since you're out here drawing.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.730
Hey, this is an abstract, isn't it...?

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.270
Next episode: "Untitled"
