WEBVTT

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.820
The Ketsuryugan

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.930
You're going to tell me everything I want to know.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.800
I wonder if you can make me?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.090
Severe Wind Destruction!

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.260
Severe Wind Destruction!

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.550
This isn't over yet!

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.090
There's no wind.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.970
So this is the eye of the storm!

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.130
Now, tell me everything.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.510
No way.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.380
Damn it!

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.800
What's that?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.010
Don't think I'll fall for the same trick twice!

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.180
So this is Hell Valley…

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.430
The Chinoike Clan really lived here?

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.680
Yes, we did.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.590
Take a good, long look.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.930
That's proof people lived here.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.470
False suspicion was cast on them

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.340
and the Uchiha Clan forced them all the way here.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.930
The clan had no choice but to settle here.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.260
They drank this scalding water,

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.340
hunted down whatever birds they could that flew past…

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.470
ate the meager grass that grew in the soil in order to survive.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.800
Weary of fighting,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.470
the clan never ventured out into the outside world,

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.970
and scraped out a living, so I've heard.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.720
"So I've heard"?

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.930
By the time I was old enough to understand,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.220
I was already living in Oyashiro's mansion.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.130
I was told Oyashiro kidnapped me from Hell Valley…just me.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.010
You were all alone?

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.260
You were all by yourself?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.010
What? You're actually interested?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.760
How unlike you.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.380
Then let me show you.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.010
I was the only one from the Chinoike Clan.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:43.380
But there were lots of kids like me at Oyashiro's mansion

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.090
and we were all forced to train to become shinobi.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.340
What's the matter?

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.720
If you don't win, you'll go hungry.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.380
You did well, Chino.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.380
And on that day, Oyashiro brought me to…

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.590
the Coliseum.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.840
Representing President Kusabi of Kusabi Real Estate Company

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.220
and currently on a record-setting run of no losses!

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.470
The Hurricane Kid who has no mercy…

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.720
Fuushin!

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.130
And going up against him…

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.800
representing Mr. En Oyashiro, who returns after a long absence…

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.340
The Beauty of the Ketsuryugan… Chino!

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.050
I've never heard of the Ketsuryugan.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.930
Just what kind of power is it?!

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.930
It seems like our audience is very curious too!

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.260
And now, let's begin!

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.930
Ready… Fight!

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.840
If you're so eager, I'll show you my Ketsuryugan.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.550
I'll blow you away before you have the chance.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.550
Typhoon Style: High Wind Destruction!

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.300
Whoa… What's this?!

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.590
Fuushin's just been standing there!

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.010
What's wrong, Fuushin?!

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.800
Did I…just lose?

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.090
Yeah, you lost.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.680
Can you believe this?!

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.800
The one and only Fuushin has lost to a young girl in her debut match!

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.760
There we go.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.340
You're really strong!

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.220
Are you being sarcastic?

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.340
N-No way!

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.760
My eyes are…

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.590
S-See…They're special, so…

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:41.930
Special, huh?

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.970
Anyone who possesses a Kekkei Genkai is special.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.630
Because of this power,

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.470
people feared me and kept their distance.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.010
At times, I was shunned and treated cruelly.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.220
Even having a past like that was better than what I had.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.300
What do you mean?

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.630
For as long as I can remember, I've been here.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.970
I have no memory about anything before I came here.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.260
I see.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.510
You're fortunate.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.970
Me? Fortunate?!

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.680
Having memories you don't want to remember is pointless.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.840
I was born in the Land of Water.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.680
But it wasn't on the mainland where the Hidden Mist Village is.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.840
I was born on a poverty-stricken island nearby.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.840
And…

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.930
Because of this power,

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.840
I was blamed for a typhoon that struck the island.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.630
They wanted to get rid of me,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.880
so I was sold off to a rich man named Kusabi.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.840
All I remember about Kusabi's place…

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.430
was the constant torture even when I was obedient.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.430
But I wasn't averse to fighting in the Coliseum.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.550
Because I was able to demonstrate my strength there.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.430
And still, I lost to a brat like you.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.430
I'm sorry I won.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.840
You better be!

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.720
Still, I envy you.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.340
I don't know what my mom or dad look like.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:39.470
I don't why I was born… or even why I'm alive.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.800
I don't have anything!

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.880
I don't care how terrible any past might be.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.340
It's better than being empty like me!

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.550
I…

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.550
I just said some terrible things.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.760
But that's how I feel.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.090
Sorry.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.010
I don't know why, but…

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.340
This is first time I've spoken about myself to anyone else…

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.510
and the first time someone's tears has actually moved me.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.550
In the end, we were both assigned to Oyashiro's guard unit…

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.930
and we started working.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.800
And one day, we found it at the Oyashiro mansion.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.340
Look, Chino!

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:39.380
And old historical document about the Chinoike Clan.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.800
Let's go, Chino.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:47.840
Huh?!

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.880
If we go to Hell Valley,

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.430
we may find some of your kin from the Chinoike Clan.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.510
And we might find something regarding your past!

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.800
If you go to Hell Valley, you won't feel so empty anymore.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.880
But there's no way Oyashiro will allow it.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.840
We don't need his permission!

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.800
Fuushin and I gathered others

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.880
who wanted to get out of Oyashiro's mansion and escaped.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.260
We're all free now!

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.630
And we ran towards Hell Valley.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.840
But…

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.930
Hey…

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:36.430
You get to live by selling these crude bamboo knick-knacks.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.180
Who do you owe that all to?

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.380
Why, we owe it all to you, my lord.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.180
– Silence! – Father!

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.130
This is hardly enough!

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.800
– So…I'll take your daughter in exchange. – Are you okay, Father?!

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.800
Amino!

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.180
Wh-Who are you?!

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.840
If you don't want to get hurt, get lost.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.800
Y-Yes…

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.380
Hurry, grab him!

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.340
S-Sir…

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.760
Th-Thank you for saving me.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.970
Think nothing of it.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.720
We just happened to see what was going on.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.720
Where are you chivalrous thieves from?

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800
Chivalrous thieves?

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:23.090
P-Please! Please continue to protect us!

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.130
We were hailed as chivalrous thieves.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.220
So we adopted the name, the Lightning Gang

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.590
and worked for the sake of nearby villages.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.340
We were treated like heroes.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.800
Every time we appeared, the villagers welcomed us.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.930
They gave us food and shelter.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.930
Everyone was kind.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.130
Sorry that we haven't been able to go to Hell Valley.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.800
That's okay.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.300
I can go to Hell Valley anytime.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.180
For now, let's work hard for these people.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.760
We owed allegiance to no one, others were at our mercy.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.840
Seeing this, some shinobi villages tried to use us.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.300
During the reign of the previous Mizukage,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.300
the Hidden Mist were our valued clients.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.130
That same thing happened then.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.180
We went after a Feudal Lord

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.680
who was taking money from the unfortunate.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.760
Oh come on. What's the matter?

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.840
You mustn't, my lord.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.510
A-Are you the infamous—?!

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.300
Yeah, we're the Lightning Gang.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.630
Get him.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.590
W-Wait…please.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.840
As long as you pay up, we won't hurt you.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.590
That's as far as you'll go.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.130
Shinobi…?!

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.760
The Hidden Mist?!

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.130
I see… You want to get rid of us. And not only that,

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.800
you intend to create a direct relationship with the Feudal Lord.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.630
Th-Thank you for saving me.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.840
You're correct.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.970
It's horrible, isn't it?

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.090
But, what's worse was…

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.220
Just for a while… Let us rest here.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.380
Please go somewhere else.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:26.590
What?

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.010
If we harbor you, we'll end up paying dearly for it!

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.880
We have no intentions of troubling the village!

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:36.840
We'll leave right away!

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.840
Just because you take money from others and give it away,

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.800
don't think you can do whatever you want!

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.180
Every village was the same.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.720
They wouldn't even give us water.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:54.800
One by one, our wounded comrades died.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.930
Eventually, it was just Fuushin and me.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.720
There's nowhere else we can go.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.380
Yes, there is.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.180
Huh?

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:15.680
So we…finally made it to Hell Valley.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.050
I'm empty, after all.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.880
Chino?!

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.840
I can't remember anything!

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.340
My father, my mother… I can't remember anyone's faces!

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.930
Coming here didn't solve anything, after all.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.430
I still don't know why I was born or why I'm alive!

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.880
Pursuers from the Hidden Mist!

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.090
Chino!

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:02.930
Chino!

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.220
Let go, you damn—!

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.970
Owww!

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.010
Chino…!

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.130
W-What the hell is this?!

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.090
What's wrong?

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.970
Chino!

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.630
Chino!

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.590
Chino, are you all right?

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.470
I…didn't know I could do this.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.220
So…that was the true power of the Chinoike Clan?

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.880
I'll get my revenge!

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.050
The Uchiha Clan was used up and absorbed by the Leaf.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.130
So why do you go so far for them?

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.090
I have a friend now who shares in my pain.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.800
He also hopes the whole world will become like that too.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.930
A world like that… is impossible!

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:03.050
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: “Sasuke's Story: Sunrise, Part 5: The Last One”

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.590
A heart that hopes for that, connects me to the Leaf!

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:28.680
Tune in again!
