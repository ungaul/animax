WEBVTT

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.000
NO TRESPASSING

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.930
In the main hall in Nakano Shrine

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.530
beneath the seventh tatami mat from the inner right side

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.000
is the clan's hidden meeting room.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.900
I see... So that's what it is...

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.570
That's my boy.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.900
Your father only talks about you.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.170
I wonder what kind of things Father was saying to Mother.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.370
If you wish to kill me, resent me, hate me!

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.000
Brother... No matter what darkness may await me,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.570
if it means killing you, I will meet it head on!

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.200
I will obtain that power no matter what!

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.370
I obtained power and hatred, and now I'm here.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.270
Itachi! This is where you'll die! By my hands!

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.470
The End

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.930
Now... As you wished, I'll recreate...

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.730
your death!

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.030
A jutsu which, like Amaterasu, cannot be evaded?!

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.230
What kind of jutsu is it?!

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.700
I get it!

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.200
That's what Sasuke's Fire Style Jutsu was for earlier!

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.570
What do you mean?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.600
The target of that Fire Style attack was never Itachi to begin with!

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.870
So what does that mean?

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.900
He purposely released his Fire Style attack into the sky,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.700
causing a sudden warmth in the atmosphere

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.670
and he created an ascending air current!

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.700
Ascending air current?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.230
To form cumulonimbus... In other words, thunder clouds!

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.770
So what does that mean?

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.670
Instead of using his own chakra...

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.930
he intends to take advantage of the massive energy in the atmosphere

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.530
to create a Lightning Style Jutsu!

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.630
What kind?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.470
In any case, it'll be on a totally different scale

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.070
than what anyone can create using change in Chakra Nature alone.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.930
I see...

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.070
Sasuke purposely lured Itachi outside,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.870
so he could also use the heat created by Amaterasu.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.530
This jutsu brings down thunder from the heavens.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.200
I merely direct its power toward you.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.500
Just as I thought... Which is why it cannot be evaded.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.930
Why not?!

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.630
A bolt of lightning is 1/1000th of a second.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.100
It's faster than sound!

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.830
The name of this jutsu is "Kirin."

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.730
What's that?!

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.530
Sasuke has tamed lightning?!

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.470
Come!

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.700
Vanish with the roar of thunder...

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.870
Such power...

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.400
Did Itachi...die?

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:31.800
It's...over.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.430
It's over!

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.200
Is this...the death you wanted to recreate?

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.470
Damn you!

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.730
That's...!

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.370
Without this, I would have been dead.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.130
What is that?!

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.370
You really have...gotten stronger...

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.370
Sasuke.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.200
This time... I shall show you my final trump card...

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.430
The Susano'o.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.700
I shall show you my final trump card... The Susano'o.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.570
Susano'o?

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.330
Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu...

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.930
When these two powers awakened,

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.800
one more jutsu took root in my eyes.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.670
Sasuke, is that it for your jutsu?

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.600
If you are hiding another power, don't hold back.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.600
The real battle is only beginning.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.930
The sky is clearing...

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.270
It seems that last jutsu is limited to one shot.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:36.930
What's that?!

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.330
What's the matter?

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.130
Have you used up your chakra and run out of options?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.700
What?!

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.300
I can give it to you...

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.870
I can lend you power... Damn it!

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.100
You need me, don't you, Sasuke?

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.270
I thought you were going to get revenge on Itachi?

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.230
Now, release my power!

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.500
Then your wish...

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.570
Judging by the feel of it...

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.700
This is Orochimaru's Eight-Headed Serpent Jutsu.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.930
What is that?!

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.270
It's because Sasuke tried to squeeze out more power

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.270
despite having no chakra!

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.330
Orochimaru's chakra that he'd absorbed and suppressed

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.300
has shoved its way to the surface!

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.700
Finally, it comes out...

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.030
Is that...?!

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.230
A gross fellow as always, puking out stuff from his mouth.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.570
Persistent vermin like his namesake...

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.730
This is it! This is what I have been waiting for!

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.930
Thanks to you, Sasuke's repressing chakra is gone!

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.000
Now's my chance to take over the child's body!

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.330
And...!

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.570
You think I can be beaten with that level of attack?

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.430
Now then, Sasuke... What will you do next?

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.230
This sword! It can't be...!

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.700
The Totsuka Blade?!

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.300
Itachi... You had it hidden in your possession...?!

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.130
What is that sword anyway?

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.430
The Totsuka Blade, also known as the Sakegari Blade,

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.130
is a sword of sealing.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.530
It is said to trap and seal away those it pierces

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.400
in a genjutsu world of drunken stupor for all eternity.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.100
The blade itself is imbued with a Sealing Jutsu

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.570
and is a variant of the Snake Sword.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.470
Orochimaru has long searched for it.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.400
Itachi's power really is immense!

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.070
This is it...Sasuke.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.630
What's with Itachi's jutsu?

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:53.000
That Susano'o jutsu... it seems to be awfully risky.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.330
But...

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.730
Sasuke's even lost his Sharingan

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.070
and he's been stripped of Orochimaru.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.870
Don't you think Itachi's won this one already?

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.530
Now...your eyes are mine.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.400
I think I'll take my time to retrieve them.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.470
Wha--?! What's this?!

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.800
Something seems wrong...

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:13.630
Damn it!

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.370
That jutsu he called Susano'o...

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.470
Its shield is repelling every attack!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.670
There's no mistake about it...

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.730
That is also a spirit weapon.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.970
It's called the Yata Mirror and is said to deflect all things.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.800
Combined with the Totsuka Blade for attacks, he's invincible.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.000
They're my eyes... Mine...

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.770
Itachi went down?!

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:17.330
No way?! Itachi is... Itachi is dead?

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.470
It's Sasuke's victory.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.230
Something doesn't feel right... About what?

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.570
Itachi's strength was greater than this. His moves weren't normal...

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.170
Even you said something was weird.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.770
That's true...

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.970
He wasn't able to counter attacks that he should have countered...

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.230
He coughed up blood several times during the fight...

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:53.200
Maybe Itachi had sustained serious damage even before the battle.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.800
Was it caused by excessive use of his Sharingan?

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.330
No... There's no way we can tell.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.970
Damn it! What is this guy?!

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.700
All he's doing is trying to stall us!

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.970
Why can't I hit him with my Rasengan?!

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.200
No... That's not it!

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.900
I did hit him, yet...

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.700
Damn it!

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.530
We can't waste any more time!

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:55.330
I have to get past here... I have to get to Sasuke!

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.370
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "The Mystery of Tobi"

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.030
Make sure to tune in next time!

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.970
Tune in again!
