WEBVTT

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.010
What did I really lose that day?
ano hi honto ni ushinatta monotte nan dattakke

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.100
For the life of me, I can't remember.
tou ni wasureteshimatta yo

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.520
We slowly lost sight of each other in the twilight...
yuugure de futari sukoshizutsu mienakunatteitte

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.440
And yet we're stuck here - unable to go home.
sore nanoni bokura kaerezu ni ita

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.240
Weak, frail souls lost in the world...
dokoka ni kowaresou na moroi kokoro

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.540
We act strong to hide their fragility.
tsuyogaru kotoba de ootte kakushiteru

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.750
Hide their fragility... ootte kakushiteru

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.380
So farewell, but even forced apart...

00:00:49.780 --> 00:01:00.010
sayonara aenakunattatte Our stories go on.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.010
bokura wa tsuzuki ga aru kara

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.180
Even in a world without you, I run.
kimi no inai sekai datte hashiru yo

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.400
To someday get past the pain.
itsuka no itami mo koete

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.900
koete Someday...

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.070
Meeting

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.430
You're awake.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.670
Great Lord Elder!

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.030
I thought your life would be in danger if I left you like that.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.770
I'm beholden to you.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.200
Can't wait even though you're ailing?

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.230
This works best for the wound.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.500
What of the boy?

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.070
He is speaking with the real Pain.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.600
What?! Speaking with Pain?

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.900
The two children of prophecy have come face to face.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.800
How will they settle this?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.400
I want to hear what you have to say... then decide.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.430
Fine. I will show you our pain.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.870
Nagato! This is a waste of time!

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.470
Let's deal with him right now.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.900
Wait, Konan...

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.770
I want to hear his answer.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.530
Besides, he won't go down so easily.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.400
He crushed the six Pains and made it here alone.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.970
Two moments define my greatest pain.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.070
One is the death of my parents.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.230
It was when the Hidden Rain Village became involved

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.070
in the Great Nations' war and was turned into a battlefield.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.300
Found anything?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400
Yeah, some canned goods.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.770
Our first meal in four days!

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.670
No, three days.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.630
Who cares? Let's eat. I won't last another minute.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.100
Let's search the other places later.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.200
We might find more stuff.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.330
Now's our chance to make a run for it.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.970
What if they see us? I'm scared.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.430
Don't worry. Just be very quiet.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.430
Man, that's good!

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.430
Who's there?!

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.770
Damn! Enemies?!

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.870
Run now!

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.200
Nagato, go!

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.670
Nagato... Hurry... Get away...

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.330
Run, Nagato!

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.030
Run away! Hurry!

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.130
H-He's just a kid?

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.970
Oh no... These people are not ninja!

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.570
What'll we do?!

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.270
Why did this happen?!

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.770
How could we mistake them for the enemy?!

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.630
Damn it!

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.970
W-We didn't know there were still any civilians in the war zone.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.930
I'm so sorry, kid.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.330
What? What happened?

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.430
Dad... Mom?

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.500
My mother and father died in the war

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.070
that your Hidden Leaf started.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.630
I've never forgotten the pain of that moment.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.030
I've endured it to this very day.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.200
This pain turned into hatred

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.500
and made my powers blossom.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.830
It wasn't until later that I realized I was the one who killed the two ninja.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.930
Goodbye, Mom...Dad...

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.900
Food became scarce, so I left my home.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.130
This is the last that's left.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.170
I'm too hungry to walk.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.870
Thank you... If you didn't wake me up, I'd probably be dead.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.500
Sorry... Even if you follow me, I can't feed you.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.630
I don't have a thing to eat.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.200
Excuse me... Can you spare some food for me?

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.800
I...

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.530
I haven't eaten in so long.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.170
I'm sorry... I have nothing to give you.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.630
Times are tough. We barely have enough for ourselves.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.270
I'm really sorry, but try somewhere else.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.270
But this was my last stop.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.500
Let's go...

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.730
I can't go any further... Am I going to die here?

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.830
Here... Eat this.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.100
Are you sure?

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.600
Uh-huh...

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.900
Here, eat this slowly.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.730
Konan, who are those two?

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.630
Sorry... They were on the verge of dying.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.300
You even picked up a dog?

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.000
Cripes, what's the name?

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.230
Chibi...

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.830
You sure have a weird name!

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.100
No, I meant the dog.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.900
It was then that I met Konan, who stands before you,

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.200
and a boy named Yahiko.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.530
They were also war orphans.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.470
But they were strong, fighting desperately to stay alive.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.100
And I joined them.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.500
Wow... So much food...

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.130
If you intend to stay here, I expect you to help find provisions too.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.900
Provisions? How?

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.100
- We steal. - Steal?

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.900
But...isn't that a bad thing?

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.070
Are you stupid?

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.370
We live in hard times where we have to fend for ourselves.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.530
Pretty words are not enough to get us by!

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.330
Pretty words...

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.000
We have to do whatever it takes to live, even stealing.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.400
Got it?

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.630
Got it.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.100
Could you please give us some food?

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.030
Just a little will do...please.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.470
I don't have any fish to give out. Now scram!

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.630
You stingy man!

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.600
What?! You rotten brat!

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.070
Ah! Hey!

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.130
You stray dog! Stop!

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.930
My goodness! Huh?!

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.700
Hey!

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.430
Where'd they go?!

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.800
Good job, Chibi!

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.670
Hey! If you're not gonna buy, go away!

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.900
Ow...

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.670
Shameless kids!

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.200
Next time, you won't get off so easy!

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:11.370
Facilities to help war orphans of a tiny nation were non-existent.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:16.930
For kids without family, there was no other choice.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.030
Yet even in such a reality, Yahiko never lost hope.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.830
Yahiko never lost hope...

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:38.370
Are you guys okay? Well, these things happen.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.230
I guess... Nagato... Do you have a dream?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.730
A dream?

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.330
I don't intend to die in a place like this.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.930
I have a huge dream!

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.830
World domination!

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.330
World domination?

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.470
That's right!

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.800
If I rise to the top of the world,

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.000
I'll never have to go through this suffering again!

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.600
You think so?

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.270
Besides, if I were to keel over now,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.300
I couldn't face Mom and Dad who brought me into this world.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:13.900
Right, Konan?

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.330
Uh-huh...

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.630
If you conquer the world, you can do whatever you please.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.830
That's just like being a god.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.530
I wonder if you can stop the fighting too.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.400
Are you all right?

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.770
Uh-huh...

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.200
Damn... What was that?!

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.400
Ninja are fighting so close.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:58.070
It's Hanzo and the Hidden Leaf ninja!

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.070
It was Jiraiya Sensei and his two comrades.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.000
They who would later become known as

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.930
the Legendary Sannin of the Hidden Leaf.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.270
Their opponent was Hanzo, leader of the Hidden Rain.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.430
The battle raged on.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.270
And...

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.430
Chibi!

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:20.970
Chibi is...

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.470
What'll I do, Yahiko?! Chibi's not breathing!

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.330
Worry about Chibi later! First, we have to get away from here!

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.970
Chibi...

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.270
Damn it!

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.970
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.100
Why?!

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.270
If the fighting doesn't stop...

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.770
I'll become the god of this world!

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.930
That's when...Yahiko's dream became my dream.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.700
Nagato... Stop your crying!

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.970
If all you do is cry after you get beaten down,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.330
nothing will change!

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.930
Just like this nation.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.700
I'm going to change this nation!

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.970
And for that you need more than words, you need power!

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.670
Power?

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.370
We're going to learn ninjutsu!

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.030
Ninjutsu? From who?

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.800
The Hidden Leaf ninja who were fighting Hanzo.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.130
I just went to the battle site.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.970
I didn't see their corpses.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.000
They fought with Hanzo, but they're still alive!

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.000
They must be amazingly strong!

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.830
But...

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.730
I hate Hanzo!

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.530
He changed Hidden Rain Village into a war zone like this.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.770
Anyway, I'm gonna become a student of those strong ninja.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.670
I'm going after them!

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.730
What if you go after them and find out they've been killed?

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:21.670
Then I'll look for whoever did them in.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.500
I've made up my mind.

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.100
Take only nonperishable foods.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.370
Do we just toss the rest?

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.570
No.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.530
Goodbye, Chibi.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:48.900
What're you doing here?

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.530
These are for you to share with the grocer and the fruit stand lady.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.600
I figure, in some ways, we owe you.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.900
Take care.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.570
We're sorry...

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.430
Huh?

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:13.330
But pursuing the Leaf's Sannin was no simple task.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:20.070
Going after ninja meant going deep into the battle zone

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.870
even though we were just kids.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.230
Don't ever take off your mask.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:29.100
If there are toxins in the mist, that'll be the end of us.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.430
Are you okay?

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.330
Stop!

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.000
A booby trap!

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.670
Well? Do I look cool?

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.430
We're gonna become strong!

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.000
- Right! - Right!

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.170
There's no way a ninja would leave tracks behind.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.730
The Leaf's Sannin were not easy to find.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.170
But Yahiko refused to give up hope.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.770
We headed deeper into the battle zone.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.800
We believed that the greater the intensity of battle,

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.070
the more likely we'd find the Sannin.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:37.970
Here!

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.130
Hang in there, Konan!

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.830
Okay.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.200
It seems like... the explosions have stopped.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.500
This is a bad spot!

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.600
Yahiko... Yahiko...

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.470
Where am I?

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.070
We found them... Huh?!

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:52.700
Fate took us straight to the Leaf's Sannin.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.800
We finally found him.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.500
We found Jiraiya Sensei.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:16.700
When the fireworks suddenly explode in the air...
fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:22.200
I couldn't keep my eyes off from your face...
muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:31.420
sotto nusumimita no I gazed at you quietly...

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:47.270
It'd be so much easier if I was able to hate you...
kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:53.650
Because I always remember you, in situations like this...
kyou mitai na hi ni wa kitto

00:21:54.010 --> 00:22:00.780
I can't help but think about the times we spent together.
mata omoidashiteshimau yo

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:10.250
I'm ready to forget you...
mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.380
It just tears at my heart too much.
konna ni mo kanashikute

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:21.550
I wonder... why did we meet each other?

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:25.310
doushite deatteshimattan darou When I close my eyes...

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:33.600
me wo tojireba It's like you are here.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:33.600
ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.370
I just want to protect those two.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.500
No matter what kind of pain I have to endure.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.800
I see.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.870
What are you always pondering, Sensei?

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:52.200
I want to do something about this world, which is filled with hate.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.600
And to know what the answer to true peace is...

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.030
Next time on Naruto Shippuden: "Origin of Pain"

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.330
And finally, we matured...

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.370
Tune in again!
