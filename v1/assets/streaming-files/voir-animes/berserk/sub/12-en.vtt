WEBVTT

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.140
How can he be this way?

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.520
Amidst such despair,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.860
when others cling to each other, how can he speak of survival, as though it's a given?

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.650
Why does this man's voice resonate so strongly within me?

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.160
That thing will either disappear or weaken when the sun hits it.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.540
We just have to last until morning.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.000
We're going to survive.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.580
How can this man's voice

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.840
sound so reassuring to me?

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.010
Those Who Cling, Those Who Struggle

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.070
I hope it's not broken...

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.030
I have to get out of here.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.450
Someone!

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.750
It hurts...

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.170
Is anyone out there?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.710
Someone's out there?

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.170
Please... I can't walk!

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.380
Please help...

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.730
That was a close call.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.320
It was like a cattle stampede.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.610
I'm sorry for being late.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.280
Are you okay?

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.030
Luca!

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.070
I've been watching from below.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.700
It looks like Elaine and the others are okay.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.700
Luca!

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.080
Now, now... This isn't the time to get sentimental.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.630
Can you walk?

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.180
Yeah, but I can't run.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.590
What should we do?

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.970
I-I can't do this!

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.640
Don't poke your head out, no matter what.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.230
But what are you going to do, Luca?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.850
I'll figure something out.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.440
I don't want that!

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.190
I'm too scared to be alone.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.780
I can't do it!

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.740
I need you to stay with me!

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.410
Ow... Both of us won't fit in this barrel.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.370
Besides, who'd seal it?

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.410
But...

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.670
Honestly, you're such a scaredy-cat!

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.000
Luca...

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.800
If nothing else, be a proper scaredy-cat, okay?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.220
Keep quiet, and don't make a sound.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.600
You just might be the type that survives the longest.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.810
There.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.740
Luca... Luca!

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.370
Ever since that day,

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.870
I've felt like I'm wandering through an endless night.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.790
But I had forgotten...

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.530
That this world is a place where the sun rises.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.180
The time has finally come to draw this secret sword.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.590
Even just based on that,

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.930
I have a big advantage compared to back then.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.480
Shit!

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.270
There are too many to burn...

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.190
More and more keep showing up!

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.370
Take this... Explosive Fire Sword!

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.160
Oh?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.040
Don't act dumb, you shitty bug!

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.000
I'll squash you!

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.250
Anyway, what's up with these guys?

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.380
It's the resentment of those who died here due to torture or epidemic.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.180
It's absorbing the emotions of those engulfed,

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.760
continuing to expand.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.850
It's full of their hatred and desire for salvation!

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.020
If hate is all something like that takes,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.730
the whole world would've sunk into a cesspool by now!

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.520
Why is it just happening in Albion?

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.150
Well...

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.620
This is impossible.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.660
It should not be possible.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.290
It's just like before.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.670
It's like I'm in a nightmare.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.710
Is this actually happening in reality?

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.520
If you don't want to die, do something.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.900
Lady Farnese...

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.320
He still stands and refuses to back down in this overwhelming nightmare.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.280
In all of this, he is the only certainty!

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.490
Shit!

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.030
It's coming in from behind, too!

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.490
Behind me, Lady Farnese!

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.450
O-Oh, God... Don't pray!

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.420
If you pray, your hands are closed.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.460
What's that you're holding?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.340
Here they come!

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.020
No!

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.110
This is the end... I'm going to get crushed.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.320
I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm going to die!

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.740
I can't stand it... Let me out.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.900
Let me out of here!

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.530
Not now.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.790
I might just die, anyway...

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.340
But it's warm.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.380
I don't know if I'll die yet.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.300
The more scared I am, the more alive I feel.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.090
The more blood I cough up,

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.010
the more I know that it's warm in my veins!

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.140
I'm going to try...

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.230
I'm going to try, Luca.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.520
Being scared means that I want to live!

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.460
That's...

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.110
Incredible.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:40.870
Both the living and dead. All the souls here are calling out for one thing.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.210
Right now...

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.420
Everything in my world is one unified thought.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.460
Everything desires me,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.300
the world I will create, and calls out for it.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.890
Everything will be fulfilled by one voice.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.100
Singing?

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.780
Guts, that... Huh?

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.860
This.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.990
It's resonating with the voices.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.990
Hey... Guts!

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.790
What is this agony coming from?

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.460
Oh, God...

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.520
Ah, the light overflows...

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.540
Griffith!

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.130
There will be a pillar of fire

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.680
where blind sheep gather on holy ground.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.680
The hour of Heaven's fall...

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.140
It has come.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.300
This is bad...

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.680
The tower and the monsters vanished overnight.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.200
Were we just having a bad dream?

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.290
I'm alive?

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.700
Oh, the puffy lady's alive!

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.500
I'm alive... I'm really alive.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.710
Oh, where's Luca?

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.760
Please!

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.260
Luca... Find Luca!

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.220
Wait a minute.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.380
What's going on?

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.350
Luca jammed me into the barrel.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.100
I don't know what happened after that... Luca!

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.350
Luca!

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:56.520
Lady!

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.100
Luca!

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.270
Damn it... How will we find her in all this rubble?!

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.440
I don't want this... No, Luca...

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.110
Huh?

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.120
O-O-Over here!

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.540
She said.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.710
H-H-H-Hurry up... Get me out of here.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.180
I-I-I-I'm going to catch a chill!

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.050
Luca!

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.560
I'm freezing!

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.350
You idiot...

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.140
There, there...

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.980
You're so warm.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.480
It was worth living for.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.540
They're Kushans!

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.580
Why are they all the way out here?

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.630
The guys from back then.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.920
That is the krishna sena from earlier.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.340
Could he be the one?

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.510
I don't know.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.720
Yet just as the divine prophecy said,

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.640
there was a calamity in this land, and he appeared.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.940
The one we seek must be among them, as well.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.100
No way...

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.070
If we don't get outta here after all that, I'm calling bullshit!

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.990
Capture them all!

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.200
They must be alive, not unharmed.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.160
Specifically, don't go easy on the man with the massive sword.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.790
Don't lower your guard until you've cut off his limbs.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.880
Killing blow!

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.800
Personal issues aside,

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.680
I cannot think of a better man to have at my side in such a circumstance.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.260
Although, it may not amount to much... Whatever.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.360
Damn!

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.520
Don't move!

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.980
If you make a single move, these women... Hey.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.700
Taking women and children as hostages? Barbarians.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.440
Heretics,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.080
how dare you enter our holy land and do such a thing?!

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.820
Azan!

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.540
You're tough to kill...

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.330
Lady Farnese, I am glad to see you safe.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.120
Thanks.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.450
You, as well, Vice-commander.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.660
We can talk later.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.880
Hmm...

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.380
Things have taken a strange turn in the short time I was away.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.170
Here they come.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.480
What the hell?
Hey, not again!

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.480
B-Bada?

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.070
Is this the continuation of last night?

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.330
Nothing can surprise me anymore.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.080
Zodd... Why is he here?

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:05.540
How monstrous... This isn't the time to be impressed.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.840
If we're to escape, it must be now!

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.170
Indeed.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.750
Everyone, stay together!

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.300
We'll storm through this!

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.620
In that moment,

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.580
all held their breath.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.620
And all were transfixed.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.880
Griffith...

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.400
And all realized...

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.940
That what they had desired had come.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.960
All of you, seize that man!

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.620
But, Lord Silat... Stay calm.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.870
This mission is critical for restoring our Bakiraka Clan's honor!

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:33.380
Have you forgotten our clan's centuries of torment in exile?

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.960
This is our one and only chance.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.390
Capture him before their main forces arrive!

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:39.890
Go!

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:47.940
Good!

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.810
Their ranks here have thinned!

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.230
Lady Farnese!

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.070
Why are you two bumbling around?

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.090
Where are Elaine and the swordsman?

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.350
Don't tell me they're still back there.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.380
Wait!

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.350
Haven't you had enough?

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.350
Shut up! Privates can stay back!

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.880
What'd you say, brat?

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.110
Even the main Kushan forces are here?

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:41.800
They haven't noticed us yet... No way!

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.440
You're leaving those two behind?

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.170
What choice do we have?

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.870
If we don't, we'll die for sure this time!

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.700
Shit!

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.580
What the...

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.150
Who is he?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.180
He isn't human.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.780
Do we ever get a break?

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.530
What now?

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.830
He made it!

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.710
But against such a large army... He'll be fine.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.840
I'm sure he'll protect Elaine.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.590
He'd better not die!

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.470
I'm gonna collect what he owes me!

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.600
Idiot! Keep it down!

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.360
Huh... There were other survivors.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.560
Everyone who fled into the tower died.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.070
And those of little faith who fled from the tower survived?

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:06.370
I bet none of them will ever feel like praying again...

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.410
Not so fast.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:13.500
Trying to survive is different than trying to run from fear.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.640
The survivors did what they had to do to live,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.750
without their surroundings interfering.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.550
I don't know what God thinks or anything,

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:29.050
but I believe He left humans enough free will to do what they need to.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.560
Luca, what's that for?

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.900
Oh, this?

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.340
It's for a chick that died in the egg.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.270
It died without ever leaving the egg.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.340
Without meeting anyone or being known.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.120
A lonely one like that sleeps beneath the rubble.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.490
I thought I should leave flowers for it.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.800
Any sinner should have at least one person to mourn them.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.920
But if his wish came true,

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.140
what will happen to the world now?

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.430
Later, ladies!

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.140
I'm gonna bail! Bye!

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.230
As thanks, I'll be with you for free.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.150
Whoa!

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.600
I'm in a hurry, though...

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.400
I'll take you up on it another time!

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.820
They were a busy bunch... Thankfully, they're gone.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.860
I wonder if Elaine's okay.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.570
I'm sure she'll be fine with that black swordsman.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.580
He even fought Mozgus as an equal.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.290
But...

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.750
The strength to protect someone

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.750
is different than the strength to be with someone...

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.550
I need to take care of something.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.840
Are you okay?

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.840
Yeah.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.850
Nina?

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.850
Joachim... You're alive.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.240
I've been wanting to apologize to you...

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.780
For before.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.360
I was so scared of you.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.610
I thought they'd kill me if I didn't rat you out...

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.780
I know it's too late for me to say this,

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.290
but I really care for you...

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.000
I really thought I could go with you.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:26.000
But I didn't have the courage, so I ran away.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.140
I'm sorry.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.260
Goodbye.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.380
W-Wait.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.110
Wh-What did you say?

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.810
I'm going to follow the Black Swordsman.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.140
I am leaving the Order.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.040
Later.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.460
In the end, I could not escape the darkness of my childhood.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:04.260
Eventually, the darkness took shape and appeared before me.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.260
As though the fate for one who continues to fear

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.810
is to be led by the Black Swordsman

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.360
who stands alone in the darkness.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.980
They left.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.740
Thank goodness...

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.410
Hmm, Nina's late.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.950
Hey, introduce me to a noble patron, too!

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.280
Me, too.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.450
Someone with more money than you, if possible.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.430
Are you sure?

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.760
Yeah, if I go back now, I won't be able to leave.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.440
I'm sorry, Luca.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.470
I'm making you worry until the very end.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.840
I'm going with Joachim.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.230
I love you and the others.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.140
But if I stay with you,

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.190
I'll end up hating you again someday.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.780
And I'll hate myself, too.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.200
People who are strong will end up hurting others,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.160
and people who are weak will end up hating others.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:20.330
I think I'll go with this man, who has the same weakness and sin.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:26.670
If I'm with him, I think we can both become a little stronger.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.090
And a little kinder.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.260
So slow!

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.270
She really is such a handful.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:42.810
A rift appeared in the frontier that day.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.640
Where the world's shape began to crumble.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.580
2017 Spring

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.800
The Next Arc Arrives
