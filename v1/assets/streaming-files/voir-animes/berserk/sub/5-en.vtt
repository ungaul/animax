WEBVTT

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.730
Hey, brat... Put that down.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.730
No way!

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.660
After four whole days, I finally got this food.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.840
You should all work for what you need.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.670
Don't latch on to a kid!

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.040
You're all grown-ups!

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.940
Man, talk about pathetic...

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.740
Ow!

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.090
Says a burglar.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.350
Want me to make it so you never become a pathetic grown-up?

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.120
Right here, right now, squirt.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.840
You giant freak!

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.420
You look like your brain stunted at three years old.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.010
I'm not gonna say that out loud, though.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.530
You just did, idiot.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.200
Don't get so hung up over the details.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.000
Here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.390
I don't want to die before I've had a girl, anyway.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.630
Nice.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.410
There's even ale.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.530
The villagers here must've run off in a hurry!

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.550
I bet there are valuables, too.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.900
Many thanks to the Kushans!

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.380
Is it good?

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.030
Yeah, but there's not enough for you.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.060
Oh, yeah?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.530
I scrounged all that food together.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.080
I hope you take the time to enjoy it.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.330
Yeah, yeah. Just go already—

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.840
Hey, what's wrong?

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.060
Brat, what did you do?!

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.940
Oh, this sure is potent.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.340
It was pretty expensive, after all...

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.280
My share's over here.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.260
I'm not a fan of being underestimated.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.010
Squirt... I'm gonna crack your head right open—

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.620
Don't call me "squirt."

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.060
I have a name, Isidoro.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.940
Don't worry, it's just bee venom.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.380
It won't kill you.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.520
Have a change of heart and live honestly.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.640
You know, it's sad when a kid's lecturing you!

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.420
Later.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.430
Hey, what's wrong?

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.660
Everyone's passed out.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.640
Shit!

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.200
I didn't know there were more.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.360
Calm down... Stay calm... Think... Think!

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.920
What happened?!

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.250
Who's this brat?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.310
I was so scared!

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.850
It was the Kushans!

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.680
What?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.260
The army came and... N-No, he—

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.190
What now?

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.810
We have to get out of here.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.900
We don't have time to lose!

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.570
Fools...

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.850
Hang on, brat.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.570
It doesn't make sense.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.470
I didn't hear any hooves or anything.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.650
And look... None of them have injuries caused by swords.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.900
Now that you mention it... What's with you, brat?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.420
Why are you unharmed, if Kushans were here?

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.350
Huh? Because I'm just a kid...

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.540
The Kushans have no mercy, even for kids.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.610
Where'd they go?

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.480
Um... Shit! Shit!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.610
Th-That way!

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.160
Hmm?

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.170
Tower of Conviction

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.170
It's the Kushans!

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.750
They're Kushan scouts!

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.670
We're surrounded!

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.410
Shit, we have to fight!

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.800
No way...

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.190
They all died in a flash!

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.220
That's...

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.600
What was that for?

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.320
What an unexpected test of my new blade.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.210
He cut up those Kushan monsters with one strike!

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.980
Hey, clear the way. I'm in a hurry.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.390
What's with you guys?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.970
No talking my way out of this?

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.810
Hey, squirt... Hey, stay still, with your head down.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.810
You're... Hey, been a while!

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.630
Nice work, as usual, Godo.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.430
Hey, you have food, huh?

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.870
And ale, too.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.900
I can smell them, even though they're hidden.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.470
They'll do as a sign of thanks.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.790
No need to hold back.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.250
A-Amazing!

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.350
Hey, let's go, Puck.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.180
Okay.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.640
Whoa!

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.980
W-Wait... He's no ordinary guy!

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.060
You are certain we can let that man go, Young Master?

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.910
It's of no consequence.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.530
The Bakiraka Clan's duty is to scout ahead.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.840
There is no need to take further casualties.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.450
But if we, the Tapasa, combine our strength—

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.430
Do not underestimate him.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.920
We may be able to subdue him, yes.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.670
But we will not do so unscathed.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.980
You know of this man, Young Master?

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.560
It was in the past...

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.880
A very long time ago.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.000
Quickly.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.300
Hurry.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.400
Not another monk...

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.610
It was heretics.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.780
There will be even more inquisitions now...

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.070
Hey, stop!

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.600
Alms... Alms, I beg of you.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.470
Fools!

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.300
These are tributes to the monastery.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.360
You have already received your daily rations.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.930
That soup of vegetable scraps isn't enough!

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.360
You guys eat your fill every day, right?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.910
Please have mercy...

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.030
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.450
Ah, food!

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.100
Alms!

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.500
Mercy!

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.700
S-Stop!

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.470
Catch them all!

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.540
Don't let a single one escape!

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.880
Crap... It's the Holy Iron Chain Knights!

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.240
P-Please help—

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.170
Have mercy!

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.300
What is the meaning of this?

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.710
Is this what the faithful would do?

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.290
Some of us are sick...

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.070
We've been living on watery soup for days.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.140
We have no firewood for winter!

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.170
We have already requested food, medicine, and other supplies from the Holy See.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.440
You are not the only ones who suffer!

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.420
Please...

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.330
My child no longer even has the strength to nurse.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.040
He's about to die.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.180
He needs God's protection right away!

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.700
What?

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.700
Very well.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.710
Because of your bravery, God will show you His mercy.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.460
But, Father Mozgus, that will disrupt order!

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.490
Of course I have considered that.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.790
But I believe the fact that I am here

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.400
and that she has sinned and has been brought before me

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.220
are all part of God's design.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.560
It is said that love knows no fear.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.610
We should respond to her act of pure love, committed without

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.570
regard for her own well-being.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.070
Thank you! Thank you!

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.070
For now, let us take these people to the monastery.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.080
These men should go there.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.610
Do not worry.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.230
You will see them again later.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.510
Now, you will go this way.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.750
Now, drink...

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:42.690
Good.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.970
The child seems to be stable now.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.680
If he stays nourished and gets some rest,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.250
he'll recover soon.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.560
I'm so glad!

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.880
I have sent a message to the Holy See with a request for aid.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.460
I shall also see if we can distribute a portion of the food

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.200
from the earlier tributes among the refugees.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.330
Oh, I don't know what to say... Thank you!

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.340
I have merely executed God's will.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.800
Now, come this way, please.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.100
As one of the faithful, you have a duty to perform.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.180
Lady Farnese, I believe this is the first time you've set foot in this room.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.940
You must not look away!

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.860
This hellish scene is part of the Holy See you serve.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.020
It is not only benevolence that God bestows upon this world.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.460
He is also a stern judge.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.200
You must not flee!

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.870
To save your child, you have sinned.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.090
Your love and bravery should be praised.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.800
However, sin is sin!

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.360
Because you are so brave,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.730
I beg you to overcome this ordeal from God Himself!

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.480
Surrender yourself to God's grace.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480
N-No!

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.620
Let me go... I didn't kill any monk!

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.670
I'm not a heretic!

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.880
We have a witness to the crime!

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.520
What the hell? Shit!

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.510
Who was it?

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.750
Who framed me?

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.080
I'll kill you!

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.550
I'll kill you when I come back!

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.000
Take him.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.020
Ah...

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.310
He's the thug who's been intimidating everyone around here.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.410
No one liked him...

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.330
I guess someone decided to get rid of him,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.060
but I feel like spitting on both their faces.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.250
Can you try to get more into this?

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.380
Oh, oops, sorry!

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.530
But are you sure about this?

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.320
Every day, you're here before the sun's even set.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.070
You don't want me here?

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.820
No, you're special...

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.150
Business aside, I'm glad to have you here.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.080
But I'm worried that you'll get reprimanded

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.760
by that scary commander lady.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.170
No need to worry about her.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.490
All she talks about is duty and faith.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.450
She works her men hard,

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.540
but she isn't skilled in fighting or leadership.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.500
For the Holy Iron Chain Knights, having a female commander is tradition.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.140
She's only a figurehead.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.220
It must be tough, I'm sure...

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.620
To be the only woman among men.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.940
I don't even want to know what it takes to work so hard on a shitty mission like that.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.800
You hedonist...

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.160
Oh.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.220
Bad Elaine!

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.670
I've told you that you can't come in here. This is my job!

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.260
I've gone all soft... Sorry, she's my little sister.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.460
What's with all the bandages?

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.130
Disease that comes with our profession.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.300
She was unlucky.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.680
She's almost all gone upstairs.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.630
That's too bad.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.590
Well, for now, I'll go home.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.540
I'll give you extra next time.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.360
Here, the usual fee.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.170
And here.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:27.310
Wow, that's pretty... It wasn't cheap.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.950
It'd be out of reach for common folk.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.020
I'm happy you got it for me, but I'm not sure I deserve something like this.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.840
Cast not pearls before... You know.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.010
I think I'm getting too old for this.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.060
Once this job's done, I'll take you back home.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.410
As the family heir, I can't marry you,

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.850
but all the nobles have mistresses, anyway.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.460
I'll pamper you.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.070
We'll bring your little sister, too.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.390
I'll find her a good doctor.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.690
Thanks, Jerome...

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.400
I'll wait, but I won't expect anything.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.410
Jeez, I couldn't be a whore if I took all the pillow talk seriously...

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.420
Hey, hey!

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.910
I heard that, Luca.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.050
Girls... Lucky Luca...

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.610
I wish someone would talk like that to me!

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.310
Oh, stop it.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.700
It's only because it's good to know influential people for when you need help.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.170
Aw... Come on!

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.970
Yeah.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.170
So, by the way, Luca...

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.630
Don't eat it all at once.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.620
We know!

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.070
Thanks, as always.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.100
Oh, and this... Wow!

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.180
You shouldn't have!

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.280
Listen, everyone gets an equal number of pearls.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.940
But this was for you.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.130
I'll keep some, too, of course.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.530
We all agreed to this, remember?

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.450
No matter who earns how much, we split our earnings.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.460
Yeah, but... This looks so expensive.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.800
Hey, Pepe, Fouquet, Lucie.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.940
Listen well.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.100
We're working in the middle of a witch hunt for heretics.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.540
You get that, right?

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.890
Even though it's to survive, it's so dangerous.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.360
Humans are wretched creatures...

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.820
They envy those who have more,

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.930
and they sneer at those who have less.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.720
Even the smallest differences can cause fear and hatred.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.790
I'm sad to say it,

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.290
but that's especially true of us, who have little.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.100
That's not true. We're...

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.460
That's why we'll prove that we're different.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.990
When actions don't follow words, there's no trust.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.580
All right, then!

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.320
Just like usual, share half our earnings among our neighbors.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.620
Not again!

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.920
That's such a waste... I told you.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.310
It's so that we don't earn any grudges.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.270
Just go and charm them!

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.410
Okay.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.000
Huh? One's missing.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.550
Oh, that's no good.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.780
I'll have to tie it more tightly...

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.430
Bear with me, even if it's a bit tight.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.470
If a looker like you went wandering defenselessly around here,

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.740
you wouldn't stay safe for a single day.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.470
You'd be the perfect victim for all the desperate men.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.950
Normally, I'd ask you to earn your own keep,

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.970
but since you aren't even capable of making your own decisions...

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.210
And that brand on her chest...

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.860
There must be a story behind it.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.280
Luca!

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.210
Oh, hello!

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.960
Please wait, good sir.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.800
Nina, I'm going to work another job.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.230
Please make sure everyone gets food, and take care of Elaine.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.870
Okay.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.450
Also...

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.110
Here.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.290
I talked to a customer, a doctor, about you.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.590
And he gave me this.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.230
He said to take two swallows each morning and night.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.820
Thanks, Luca...

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.730
I'll go get some water.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:58.990
Heretics!

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.780
Throw!

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.120
Just throw now!

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.580
The bleeding just won't stop.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.630
There's some pus in there, too.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.410
My mouth's getting swollen.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:45.790
This might be it for me...

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.750
The doctor said that

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:54.250
if the bad blood reaches my brain, I'll go insane.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.930
Will I become like you?

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.750
Do you have anything you're afraid of, Elaine?

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.190
That place is supposed to be where God is present.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.800
Why does it look so stark and terrifying?

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.480
Scared... I'm so scared.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.950
I can't stand it, Luca...

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.050
I'm scared of dying and living,

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.210
of this world and of God.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:33.270
I'm... I'm scared of everything!

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.940
Found you...

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.820
He ran a whole day and a half, from yesterday afternoon?

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.820
If I hadn't hitched a ride on a refugee's carriage, I would've lost him!

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.460
That sharp edge... So giant.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.570
It must be a famous sword!

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.880
It won't budge!

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.480
But he was wielding it like a feather...

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.050
You aren't putting your back into it.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.880
Put your back into it.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.820
Here, like this! See?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.800
I'm Puck.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.520
When you ask people for their names,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.130
you should always introduce yourself first.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.860
I-Isidoro... Though I didn't ask...

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.850
Well, then, Isidoro or whatever,

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.880
put your mind to it and give it a go.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.210
You're not trying to stop me?

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.440
Heave-ho!

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.080
Hey, Guts... I caught a thief.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.100
It isn't a toy for kids.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.780
It seems you've been following me since yesterday.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.430
What do you want?

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.290
You want to become his apprentice?

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.370
Then, you'll have to go through me, his manager, first—

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.030
That's not it!

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.490
I don't wanna serve anyone.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.560
O-Oh!

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.450
You must've come to take back the food you gave me!

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:33.390
What a disgrace!
Too bad.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.500
We already ate everything!

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.040
That's fine...

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.850
You have a sword.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.680
You want to become a swordsman?

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.340
Have you ever drawn blood with a sword?

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.120
D-Don't underestimate me.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.600
I've killed one or two...

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.850
Well, whatever...

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.430
You should stay away from me.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.470
What I choose to do is my own business!

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.480
You have no right to tell me anything!

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.030
Well, you're right.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.160
Hey, thief... You should run.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.740
My name is Isidoro!

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.410
Here they come.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.920
What the hell?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.660
Guts!

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.710
Well, this is different.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.680
Shit!

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.870
Shit!

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.260
Damn you!

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.520
Is this real?!

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.020
Damn you... I'll rip you to pieces.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.270
I don't recall anything that'd make a wheel curse me!

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.640
Shit!

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.980
Go to hell!

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.210
Damn you all!

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.400
Full of hatred, eh?

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.340
On any other day, I'd feel the same. But right now...

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.010
I don't have the time to deal with you.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.960
I'm in a hurry.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.730
I feel like I'm burning up inside...

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.550
Out of the way!

Shadows, karma... Like I give a damn.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.550
Joy?

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.510
You sure have some impressive faith.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.510
You look to be in good health, Struggler.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520
All of this, for God alone!
