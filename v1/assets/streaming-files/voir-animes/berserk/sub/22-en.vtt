00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.440
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.280
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.280
At least it is true...

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.330
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.910
O prince...

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.040
O prince of the unforgiven...

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.340
We are honored to be received in audience...

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.650
We shall meet again in another world...

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.820
We are your kin...

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.340
Feel no shame about shape.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.290
Weather changes their phrase.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.020
Even mother will show you another way.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.420
So put your glasses on.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.490
Nothing will be wrong.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.690
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.530
It's up to you.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.190
The first words should be found.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.800
Whatever holds you back.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.470
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.310
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.410
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.380
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.180
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.420
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.050
It's too late.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.900
Infiltration

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.100
Are you sure there's a secret passage in this dismal place?

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.140
Our sources are reliable.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.610
If it's so easy to find, then who would need the help of us mercenaries?

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.530
Found it.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.490
I guess we're not needed.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.450
Pippin.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.710
There's no mistake.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.460
This is it.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.130
Right, let's go.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.300
Wait a minute.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.220
I understand that Pippin and Judeau need to come along...

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.140
...but you're the commander now. Are you sure you should come?

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.890
If something were to happen to you...

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.980
Our mission is to rescue Griffith.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.060
We have the highest chance to succeed...

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.860
...if all four of our strongest members take on the operation.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.320
Yeah, but...

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.570
You're worried, aren't you?

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.360
Don't make me laugh!

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.490
I'm a stronger swordsman than either of them.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.910
Don't bring your personal feelings into this matter.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.370
Obey your commander's orders!

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.340
Remember... ...I can still cover your back.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.340
Don't forget that.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.760
Yeah...

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.050
Let's go.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.290
Griffith...

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.420
You were always looking up to the sky...

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.050
To climb higher... To soar higher... That's all you wanted to do.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.470
You were a hawk flying alone, reaching for the highest point...

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.510
That's right...

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.430
You were always watching us from above...

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.520
Never here on the ground with the rest of us...

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.270
Calm, cool, and always on the alert.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.190
Do you really need a reason...

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.450
...each time I decide to lay my life on the line for you?

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.580
Letting nothing stand in your path to victory...

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.290
Do you find me vile?

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.340
Griffith can't go on without you!

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.420
If that's true...

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.470
If that's the real truth...

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.880
Then I...

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.270
Pull yourself together.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.690
Griffith will be back soon.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.070
There's no way in hell I'm going to die...

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.780
Not without seeing Griffith...

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.280
Even if I need a thousand more stitches in me...

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.540
Rickert, we need some more water.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.460
Got it.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.000
When Griffith returns...

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.670
It'll be the resurrection of the Band of the Hawk!

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.760
Everyone is in good spirits...

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.770
Because Griffith will be back soon...

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.020
As long as Griffith comes back, then...

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.040
A fairy?

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.680
I saw it...

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.350
...with my very own eyes. There's no doubt.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.730
The enemy?

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.150
Why now?

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.280
Just a little more...

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.910
All we needed was a little more time, and Griffith would be back!

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.160
We can't let them destroy us! Not now!

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.170
Hey...

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.050
Where is everyone?

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:22.930
Run...

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.240
Run...

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.910
Rickert...

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.570
It can't...

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.740
This can't be real!

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.810
What...

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.230
What's going on?

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.410
I'm amazed we learned about this secret passage.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.700
We have supporters inside.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.460
Wait.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.580
Supporters of the resistance movement...

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.220
You must be the Band of the Hawk.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.220
We are at your service.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.720
The Band of the Hawk's Casca.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.140
What do you mean by supporters?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.480
They're from Princess Charlotte.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.140
Oh...

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.600
We don't have very much time until dawn.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.520
We must get to where Griffith's being kept as soon as possible.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.570
Right.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.840
We'll take it from here.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.550
Darkness... True darkness, where not a single ray of light can be found.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.470
How long have I been lying here in this darkness?

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:49.850
An eternity...

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.390
...or perhaps a fleeting moment.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.440
I feel nothing...

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.190
It's as if my body is floating in space...

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.280
I wonder... Have I managed to preserve my sanity?

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.910
Or has it already been lost long ago?

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:14.790
And yet...

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.630
...here in this empty, hollow world...

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.460
...one thing is clear in my mind.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.180
Him alone...

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.720
...like lightning splitting through the darkness...

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.770
He appears in my mind so vividly.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.280
Over and over again like the waves of a tsunami...

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.990
Hatred...

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.320
Friendship...

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.820
Jealousy...

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.570
Frustration...

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.160
Helplessness...

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.290
Affection... Sorrow...

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.330
They all come together into a giant vortex...

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.880
They pin my fading consciousness down so that it doesn't slip away.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.220
The one who caused this... My confinement in this darkness...

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.390
Will now...

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.680
...become my only chance at survival.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.770
When did it happen? This man, whose life was once in my hands...

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.650
When did I fall into his powerful clutches?

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.320
And now...

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.870
In my mind I see him radiating so brightly it pierces my eyes.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.040
Guts!

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.470
Griffith?

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:52.930
Griffith?

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.600
Is he in a different cell?

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.900
No, he has to be here on the lowest level.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.240
Griffith?

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.410
Grif...

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.920
Gri...

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.670
Griffith...

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.770
The tendons in his arms and legs have been slashed...

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.860
And his tongue...

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.400
Casca, the keys!

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.070
Casca!

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.430
Stay there!

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.220
Stay where you are!

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.930
This isn't possible.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.150
This can't be Griffith...

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.160
Guts...

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.000
Griffith!

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.670
There's no escaping now...

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.550
The guards and soldiers will be here any minute...

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.640
And in a year, you'll all be looking just like him...

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.400
You bastard...

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.030
So you're the bastard who destroyed his body...

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.070
That's right.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.410
I haven't had that much fun in a long time.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.740
You don't come across a specimen as splendid as him very often.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.710
When you're as experienced as I am in the profession of torture...

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.420
...not only do you appreciate the beauty that's on the surface...

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:12.010
...but also the beauty beneath the skin, in the tendons, muscles, and veins.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.720
He really was exquisite.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.260
It's no use.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.100
This door is four times thicker than your average door.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.000
Don't move!

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.750
Put down your weapons and surrender!

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.090
Stick with me and don't fall back!

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:52.960
Guts!

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.770
How dare you?

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.930
What the hell are you all doing?

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.890
Shoot them!

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.080
You idiots!

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.160
Who said to retreat?

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.330
Hold your ground!

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.920
Hurry!

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.630
What's taking them so long?

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.840
There are thirty of our soldiers against just the four of them!

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.260
How can it be so difficult?

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.090
Yes, but, sir...

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.970
...they're led by that man, the hundred-man slayer!

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.100
Don't be stupid!

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.180
How can we be sure that their raider commander himself is here?

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.980
No...

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.020
Besides, myths like that are born in times of war...

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.280
...when stories get exaggerated.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:02.200
There is no man in the world who can slay a hundred armed soldiers.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.120
Maybe ten soldiers at the very most.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.880
That is definitely him...

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.890
The Band of the Hawk's ruthless commander... Guts!

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.050
It's Hundred-Man Guts himself!

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.350
Surround him! What are you waiting for?

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.810
Seize him!

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:32.650
But, sir...

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.110
You idiots!

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:38.900
He's been waving his huge sword around while chasing after our men...

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.570
He's out of breath.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.320
You fools!

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:48.740
If your enemy sees you hesitating, you've already lost the battle.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.460
Put your lives on the line and see how ruthless the battlefield is!

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.250
Guts!

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:04.840
Advance!

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.810
Where are they?

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.690
See, it was too much for just the four of them...

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.360
No... You're wrong. They'll be back.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:17.980
I'm sure of it.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:31.950
Guts...

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.870
What a disgrace!

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.130
If we let them get away, the king will never forgive us.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.090
Pursue them!

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.050
We're going to head them off and then ambush them!

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:23.800
Yes, sir!

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.710
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.350
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.390
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.360
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.620
What is that?

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.890
It's just the same.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.060
What is trying your crown?

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.240
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.570
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.280
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.950
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.230
Next Episode

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:11.160
Beloved memories... Hope for survival...

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.240
All have been lost at the end of the journey.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.450
Hearts bleeding, they stand still...

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.960
...full of regret and sorrow.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.920
Despite all this, will mankind still live on?

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.970
Only the wind is left to tell us that the dream is now over.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.260
Eve of the Feast
