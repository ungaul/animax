WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's time to work.
Shut up!
I won't stop at punches next time!
Hey, are you listening to me?
Over here, hey!

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.400
On that day, a dying sun rose above the multitude of nations.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.670
What's this?

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.210
As written in the Book of Revelations,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.680
"When the sun has died five times,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.530
a red lake will emerge to the west of a city

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.140
with a name both new and old."

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.280
"It will be the sign that the fifth angel has descended upon this world.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.660
The angel is the Hawk of Darkness.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.200
He is the master of the sinful black sheep.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.010
And the king of the blind white sheep.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.040
He will usher in an age of darkness to cover the world."

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.680
The Branded Swordsman

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.620
Hey, boy!

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.350
Bring more ale! Now!

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.110
Shit... Why me?

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.040
What about our food?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.200
Shut up!

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.520
Quit makin' me rush!

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.080
H-Hey, watch out!

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.990
Quit your twitching!

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.460
How're we s'posed to hit you?
I can't get free...

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.400
Come on, keep the knives coming! Next!

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.720
The fight's on, moron.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.850
Untie me!

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.150
I'll bite right through your arteries!

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.070
I'll knock that wagging tongue right back into your skull.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.250
No, thanks! No, no, no!

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.430
Hey.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.500
Huh?

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.110
Are you trying to make me clean up corpses?

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.040
What if we are?

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.280
I came with you guys because I heard you were mercs.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.000
But you're just acting like thugs and bandits!

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.500
I want to make a name with my sword!

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.560
Oh?

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.760
Anyway, I can't do this anymore!

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.850
Don't be so full of yourself, you sniveling brat!

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.180
After everything you just said,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.770
you think you'll get out of this in one piece?

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.900
Screw you, asshole—

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.350
You'll be our next target.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.490
Hey.
Yeah?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.450
You're in the way.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.780
Can you get going?

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.720
Huh?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.450
Who do you think you're talkin' to—

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.530
You bastard!

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.770
Who do you think you are?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.130
Wha?

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.530
Sorry for the ruckus.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.590
Also, can you fill this with water?

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.530
And a bottle of rum.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.440
S-Sure.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.130
Hmm...

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.610
Oh!

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.200
There you are!

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.700
After you help someone, don't abandon them.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.610
You should take full responsibility!

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.710
Oh, hey...

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.220
What's this heavy-looking lump?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.020
Uh... I'm Puck! Nice to meet you!

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.300
I was with a traveling troupe of entertainers,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.600
but they were attacked by those bandits.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.500
I've been stuffed in a birdcage and dipped in a jug of ale.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.110
I'm surprised I'm even still alive!

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.610
Um... Um...

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.070
I think those bandits have a lot of buddies nearby.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.140
They have skilled men somewhere else.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.890
If you don't leave soon, you could be in bad trouble.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.910
Ow!

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.680
What do you think you're doing, jerk?!

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.380
Don't gab at me...

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.680
I'll crush you.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.090
Hmph!

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.470
That guy...

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.370
Crap... I might've gotten lost.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.840
Would you like to hop on?

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.140
It can't be easy, dealing with this rain at night.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.860
I'm fine. Just leave me alone.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.610
There's no need to refuse.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.650
My daughter wishes to help you, too.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.150
I'm refusing for your own good.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.650
You see, I'm possessed... By evil spirits.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.480
That's unfortunate.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.520
But there's no need for concern.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.910
I have God on my side.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.660
And a spirit of good fortune.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.920
Now, hop on...

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.430
A man with a black prosthetic arm?

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.770
I'm not lying!

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.060
I swear he had a monster's strength!

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.900
Quit your yappin'.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.150
We get it.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.400
We called in thirty or so skilled men to wait for him.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.360
We'll finish him soon enough.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.010
In any event, couldn't we have found a better meeting spot?

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.590
Huh?

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.950
Guys, did you know this?

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:42.920
Know what?

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:48.160
These parts used to be home to evil cultists that worshiped forest spirits.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.310
Evil cultists?

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.800
It's said they held sacrificial rituals where they staked your intestines

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.980
to a tree, and then made you run around the trunk.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.220
This is one of those trees.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.210
You should learn to tell better jokes.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.180
The place feels haunted enough as it is...

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.330
There are rumors that monsters appear in these forests, too.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.500
Monsters?

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.230
In this day and age, there are wars, disasters, and piles of corpses,

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.810
no matter where you go.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.920
It wouldn't be surprising if evil spirits and the like appear.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.290
What?

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.920
I got here first.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.090
I don't want to hear any complaints!

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.180
Have some, if you'd like.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.930
It's wine we made ourselves.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.190
It will warm you up.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.000
No, thanks.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.970
But...

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.430
There are many dangers at night.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.670
Jeez, don't waste people's goodwill...

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.960
Fine, give it to me—

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.390
Um, is that scar from battle?

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.930
I was bitten by an evil spirit.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.600
Oh, no. Really?

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.410
Come, now... Please don't scare my daughter too much.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.910
What is your name?

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.160
Guts.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.610
I am Adolf.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.270
My daughter is Collette.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.920
By the way, is that thing on your back a...

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.430
Well, never mind.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.800
By the way, I was watching you at the tavern earlier.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.470
I don't approve of violence,

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.190
but saving the elven child was a noble act.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.690
You don't seem to be a bad man.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.270
Are you a mercenary?

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.370
Well, something like that.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.200
I can't say I approve much

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.670
of a business that involves killing people for money.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.530
No, even to help another,

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.440
you shouldn't kill a human being so easily.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.820
This is why I don't like monks.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.330
Don't be that way.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.640
My nephew left home, saying he'd make his name with his sword.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.590
Five years ago, he died on the battlefield,

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.470
just a nameless foot soldier.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.720
If he had stayed alive,

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.120
he would have had a family, and some happiness with it.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.570
How foolish.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.480
What's so bad about that?

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.230
No matter the cause, he died doing what he wanted, right?

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.730
I'd call him a lucky man.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.780
Though, once you're dead, that's it.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.240
There's nothing beyond that.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.530
Sorry, I'll be getting some rest now.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.880
You'll catch a cold.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.940
You won't be able to escape.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.420
Griffith!

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.430
Hey, what's wrong?

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.970
Whoa, whoa!

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.420
What is that?

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.880
An incubus.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.490
An evil spirit that makes people see nightmares, to feed on terror.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.950
An evil spirit?

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.300
Then what you said earlier...

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.330
What, you believe in God, but not evil spirits?

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.770
Why is something like that here?

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.460
This attracts them.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:39.610
A brand?

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.210
What's wrong?

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.220
Stay inside.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.610
Incubi are born from bodies of the dead.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.930
Long ago, this must've been a battlefield.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.980
Evil spirits possess corpses and attack.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.080
Given the incubus we had just now, worse things may be out there.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.290
Whoa, whoa!

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.620
Idiot, get back inside!

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.700
But...

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.720
Collette!

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.290
You should run!

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.670
You're free to go, if you want.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.750
Why?

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.870
What's the point?

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.000
There are so many... You'll get yourself killed!

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.940
That's nothing new.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.650
It was far too large to be called a sword.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.540
It was far too large, thick, heavy, and much too crude.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.380
By all accounts,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.130
it was a hulking mass of iron.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.660
Wow...

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.700
What's wrong, mister?

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.270
Guts!
Shut up!

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.270
I'm busy.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.480
Guts!

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.310
Only twenty of us made it here.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.530
Don't complain.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.790
It's more than enough against one of him.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.980
H-Hey, wait a minute...

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.790
Something's wrong.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:13.570
Huh?

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.510
What the hell?

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.930
Hey, is that the guy who got you—

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.280
What the hell?

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:27.740
Guts!

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:53.570
You're too damp to be useful as firewood!

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.520
It isn't... your fault.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:45.700
Huh?

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.550
Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.220
Only the weak get themselves killed in someone else's battle.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.100
If you can't even live your life as you want,

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.740
you should just die.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.190
I'm a disaster

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.530
that those two didn't have the power to protect themselves from.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.430
That's all there is to it.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.730
I wouldn't be able to take a single step if I let myself

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.740
worry about stepping on ants.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.770
It's no use.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.500
You can't escape.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.650
No matter where you may go... ...we'll be there.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.260
We'll always be near you.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.810
You can't escape.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.140
We'll always be watching you.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.160
You are mine.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.200
You are ours.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.470
Your blood, flesh, and bones... Look, his ears.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.990
His eyes.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.520
His heart.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.690
I want his heart.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.910
As long as that brand exists...

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.200
Indeed, as long as you have that brand...

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.480
...you can't escape.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.600
No matter where you may go... ...you are ours.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.100
Your anger and grief... Shut up.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.940
Your pain... Shut up.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.040
And your terror...

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.050
All of it is ours.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.300
Shut up!

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.550
So...

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.860
This is the world Guts inhabits.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.490
We finally found you, Black Swordsman!

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.410

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.420
This is the Black Swordsman...

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.510
His malice is unmistakable.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.470
I am Azan, Second-in-Command of the Holy Iron Chain Knights!

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.470
Oh, Tonio! He was a good man...

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.470
Elves have a strong sense of responsibility.
