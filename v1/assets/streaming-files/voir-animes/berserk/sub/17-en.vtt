00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.340
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.240
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.050
At least it is true...

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.290
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.670
Guts!

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.710
Take up that sword!

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.190
Feel no shame about shape.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.140
Weather changes their phrase.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.870
Even mother will show you another way.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.270
So put your glasses on.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.340
Nothing will be wrong.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.540
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.380
It's up to you.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.040
The first words should be found.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.650
Whatever holds you back.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.320
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.160
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.260
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.230
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.030
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.270
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.900
It's too late.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.820
Moment of Glory

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.560
Griffith!

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.630
Wow!

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.030
I didn't know that so many people lived in Windham!

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.310
Pippin!

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.120
Miss Casca!

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.490
My dear sister, please turn around!

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.030
I can't take it...

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.430
The Raiders!

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.730
Commander Guts is taking the lead!

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.330
He is the man who defeated General Boscone!

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.710
The Band of the Hawk's strongest warrior!

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.380
This is great!

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.480
I've never seen such an enthusiastic victory parade before.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.150
Well, why don't you wave your arm or something, Commander?

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.280
You are the hero of the battle, after all.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.290
Commander?

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.220
What's the matter?

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.790
You look a little down.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.720
Really, I'm okay...

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.100
It's real...

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.840
Could anyone have even dreamt of this day three years ago?

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.530
That's true!

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.610
But one man did...

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.510
Only him...

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.440
I will have my own kingdom...

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.610
It's amazing...

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.980
Really...

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.090
There he is, my lady!

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.630
Look, Sir Griffith is so popular!

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.890
All of the women are in a frenzy.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.170
How dare they get so close to him!

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.860
Acting so forward!

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.800
Please, make haste!

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.900
My lady, please stand still, will you?

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.380
Otherwise, your dress...

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.300
Tell me, how do I look?

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.780
You look fantastic in it.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.550
You have changed into five dresses, my lady. It's best to decide now.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.180
Really?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.150
But I think... My lady, come here and hurry!

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.160
He is passing by, hurry!

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.990
Wait, wait!

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.170
The princess sure became cheerful all of a sudden.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.230
She would barely eat when the Band of the Hawk was in the field.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.540
Sir Griffith!

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.850
Oh no!

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.780
It is impossible in this noisy crowd.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.960
You had best wait until the celebration.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.420
Did you make the arrangements?

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.290
Consider it done.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.610
We should hold a feast to celebrate after everything has fallen into place.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.700
A feast held to express our regrets over his death.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.880
How ironic.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.610
The battlefield's White Hawk will meet his end in a birdcage of stone walls.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.820
Of course, it will happen on this day, the most notable in his entire life.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.450
This is merciful, at least.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.320
Minister Foss!

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.430
What's happened?

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.090
I've brought a letter addressed to you, sir.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.140
A letter?

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.700
But from who?

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.170
I do not know.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.270
A lady from the court entrusted this to me.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.030
Excuse me.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.610
T-This is...

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.780
What is the matter, Minister Foss?

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.690
W-Well...

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.620
Nothing is the matter, Your Majesty.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.700
I have a little errand to take care of, so please excuse me.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.290
See you later then.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.430
How?

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.650
How did this happen?

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.550
Bastard!

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.480
Look!

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.990
Here comes Sir Griffith!

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.950
The Band of the Hawk's members?

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.650
Midland's guardian angels!

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.390
I see.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.230
The heavy taxes on the commoners is spent on this place.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.000
Yeah...

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.300
Hey, stick out your chest!

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.640
They will look down on you if you aren't confident!

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.510
I'm so nervous. It's embarrassing.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.150
But we have come this far at last.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.920
That's true.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.620
I can't believe I'm standing in a place I've only heard about in fairy tales!

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.090
If I hadn't met the Band of the Hawk and Griffith...

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:21.030
...I would never have even imagined this sight, not even in a dream...

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.140
Me, surrounded by nobles in a huge castle like this.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.280
Sir Griffith!

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.850
Welcome back, my lord.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.440
Pleased to see you safe. We were worried about you.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.890
I heard that you all carried the battle on your shoulders again.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.480
Please tell us your stories of the battlefield.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.260
Would you mind if I offered myself for a dance later?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.760
I would love to dance with you too!

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.730
No, tell us your story first.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:55.800
I am afraid of boring you ladies by telling a barbarous war tale.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.870
We wouldn't be bored at all. It's very exciting!

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.000
Yes!

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.140
Wow... He certainly seems at home...

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.780
Damn, he should share one of them with me!

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.080
You must be the Band of the Hawk's commanders?

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.980
I would like you to tell me your heroic exploits on the battlefield.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.050
You certainly are strong, aren't you?

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.620
Well, I really am I must confess.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.160
I am even afraid of my own strength.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.390
It's you, isn't it?

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.770
The raider commander who defeated General Boscone in single combat?

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.440
Y-Yeah... How fabulous!

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.770
Despite the fact that General Boscone...

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.510
...was their great hero, and every country knows his reputation.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.210
That's true!

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.820
I also heard that you defeated a hundred men all by yourself.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.220
Is that true?

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.050
Y-Yeah... This is unbelievable!

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.960
Are you the strongest in the Band of the Hawk?

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.760
Who is stronger, Sir Griffith or you?

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.960
Hey, you take care of them!

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.030
Oh no!

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.440
He's leaving!

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.270
All right, no problem!

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.470
No fair, Guts!

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.610
So cute!

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.350
Um... How muscular!

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.350
Let me touch! Let me touch!

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.880
Look how carried away they are...

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.560
Deep down, all of them probably feel undeserving of this praise.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.430
Perhaps...

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:33.590
But even the generals must recognize the Band of the Hawk's true strength.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.240
Of course.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.830
Because one hundred years later...

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.570
...they have fulfilled our kingdom's long-cherished wish.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.870
As if it were nothing.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.450
It was wise that you spoke up for him earlier, Sir Raban.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.150
You have foresight, and I will follow your example.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.290
You're starting to sound like a certain minister we all know, Sir Owen.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.760
However, we will all need to be a little like that in future.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.900
The war is over.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.930
I pray to God that the upcoming peace and tranquility will last for ages...

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:13.440
In a period of peace, warriors like us who only know how to wield swords...

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.170
...have to find a new way to survive within the castle.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:23.550
Ironically, the man who brought this peace must also be aware of this...

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.120
That man stands out too much to be a part of the court...

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.750
...without causing a disturbance.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.920
The stronger a light shines...

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.960
...the darker the nearby shadows grow.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.000
Oh, jeez...

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.940
I can't deal with this.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.580
What are they doing?

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.060
Come on!

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.960
H-Hey, wait... What the...

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.360
Who the hell are you?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.840
Those men are pestering me, and I don't know what to do.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.370
I want you to pretend that you're my partner for a while.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.540
It's annoying!

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.640
Those useless sons of noblemen must not see many female warriors.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.110
They look at me like I'm some kind of rare animal...

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.280
What are you looking at?

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.250
I didn't know you liked to wear...

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.850
Don't tell me that...

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.160
Just come this way!

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.800
How embarrassing!

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.800
It's not my fault!

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.610
I see...

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.350
I'm not very good at these kinds of things.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.040
Wielding a sword is much more comfortable.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.350
I agree.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.890
But I wonder what put such an idea into your head?

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.330
To think that you, our brave sister Casca, is wearing a flowing dress...

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.660
I normally dress like a man simply because it's easier to move that way.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.290
It doesn't mean that I'm fond of wearing men's clothes!

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.500
But...

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.840
I shouldn't have done something I'm not used to.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.910
I'll make myself sick if I keep wearing these kinds of loose dresses.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.210
Come to think of it, I haven't worn a skirt for so long...

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.420
And look at all my muscles...

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.350
Don't I look ridiculous?

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.650
No, you look good.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.850
Really?

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:48.360
Sure, you look better than the noble girls crowding around Griffith.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.340
Hey, why don't you ask Griffith to dance with you?

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:57.910
No...

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.080
It's impossible...

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.650
I haven't danced since those small village festivals when I was a kid.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.580
I'd end up stepping on Griffith's feet...

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.990
Anyway, tell me why you've had such a change of heart.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.630
You've never showed up in stuffy places like this before...

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.790
I want to see everything through to the end... What?

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.030
Ever since I met you three years ago...

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.000
...what Griffith and I...

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.540
What everyone has done within these years...

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:43.010
...and what he has won so far, and what he will win in the future...

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.680
I want to see it to the end.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.150
That's why I came.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.390
Guts...

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.160
So you do want to... the Band of the Hawk.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.100
For real?

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.040
No matter what?

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.320
Long live the king!

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.360
His Majesty has arrived.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.160
You go on ahead.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.270
I'll stay here and cool off for a while.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.640
I can't stand listening to the king's tedious speeches.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.870
Don't be too long.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.530
Sure...

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.780
You...

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.870
What?

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.010
No...

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.480
Nothing...

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.460
There is another reason why I'm here at this evening party.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.700
No one knows what will happen here in a few moments.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.970
Not Casca or the other Band of the Hawk guys...

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.140
It's a little too much for them, isn't it, Griffith?

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.540
First of all, I shall share some good news with you.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.920
A little while ago, Tudor envoys were sent to our kingdom.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.460
They carried a signed armistice treaty.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:38.130
I am most grateful for your strength and fortitude through these horrible times.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.930
I should like to express my utmost gratitude.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.830
It is understandable that more than a few of you might be displeased...

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.440
...by the armistice.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.480
After all, many of you have lost your family and friends to this war...

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:56.680
...and our enmity toward Tudor has been harbored for generations.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:01.890
However, it is urgent for us to rebuild our kingdom.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.450
Our kingdom has been exhausted due to the war effort.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:11.460
I expect everyone to contribute all they can to return our land to prosperity.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.210
As you well know...

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:21.680
...this armistice is due to the Band of the Hawk's merits, led by Count Griffith.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.870
Due to their distinguished service.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.770
During the past one hundred years...

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.340
...it has been said the conquest of Doldrey would be utterly impossible.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:35.860
But they succeeded with unparalleled courage in such an undertaking.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.560
Excuse me, let me pass please.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:44.200
And I will inform you now, at this joyous celebration, that there will be...

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.700
...a rite of decoration held the day after tomorrow...

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:52.970
I deem it proper to confer upon Count Griffith and the Band of the Hawk...

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:58.710
...the title of White Knights and highest authority over Midland's army.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.910
Their official titles will most likely be...

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.150
...White Hawk General Griffith and the White Hawk Knights.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.750
All of the Band of the Hawk's company commanders...

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:15.620
...will be personally knighted by myself and raised to the peerage.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.670
The White Hawk General!

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.630
The White Hawk Knights!

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:20.900
Wonderful!

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.060
So amazing!

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.240
I can't believe this...

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.810
We're going to become noblemen! Us!

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.000
Isn't it wonderful?

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.540
Uh, thank you...

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.540
Please let me pass.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.180
Why...

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.280
A commoner, promoted to the highest rank in Midland?

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.790
Utter nonsense...

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.190
This is quite unexpected.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.050
Indeed...

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.590
This is wonderful!

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.690
You will meet your end shortly...

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.130
Go on and revel in your illusive glory while you still can.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.900
It is about time, Mr. Foss.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.280
What's wrong with you?

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.340
You look really pale...

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.640
This is unlike you.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.750
Is it because you are afraid of...

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.480
N-No, of course I'm not...

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.090
Please pull yourself together, Minister Foss.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.650
Please, sir.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.820
Certainly, thank you.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:42.540
Now, we should toast the celebration of our young heroes...

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.210
...and of course, the future prosperity of Midland.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.610
Excuse me, let me pass please.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.150
Raise your glass!

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.820
Raise your glass!

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.420
Cheers!

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.490
Please, make way.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.130
Griffith...

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.160
Griffith!

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.810
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.450
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.490
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.460
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.720
What is that?

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.990
It's just the same.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.160
What is trying your crown?

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.340
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.670
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.380
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.050
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.320
Next Episode

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:12.550
What comes to a man's mind when he realizes his dreams?

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:19.010
Days long past, future ambitions... Affection for his loved ones?

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.310
Dreams are to be fulfilled for one's own sake.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.310
But will there ever come a time...

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.020
...when one is able to retrieve what's been lost along the way?

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.350
Tombstone of Flames
