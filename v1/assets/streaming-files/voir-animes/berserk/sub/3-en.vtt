00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.180
Hey, talk about a reversal of fortunes, huh?

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.120
What was that?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.490
Night of Miracles

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.540
She can't see you?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.760
What does that even mean?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.340
Well, how should I explain?

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.500
Oh, an old fortune teller with the traveling entertainers used to say that...

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.370
Um, those with a rigid world view can't see fae.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.340
I think that was it... I see.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.770
A rigid world view, huh?

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.690
Guts!

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.940
I know.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.710
Here they come.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.820
My allies?

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.890
What?

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.820
What's happening?

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.610
Take a good look, with wide-open eyes.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.060
They're miracles, sent to this world by God,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.740
that you can't see just by worshiping an idol.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.620
I see it now.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.610
What is that?

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.390
That's where I was headed to begin with.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.590
Though there's been lots of interference.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.780
What's there?

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.270
Didn't you want to know what I was after?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.000
Eh?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.110
It's just as well.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.500
I'll tell you now.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.550
That is...

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.430
The estate of Count Lansdown, who governed Midland's western outskirts.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.000
Loving hunting and hounds, he built this manse at which to while away his idleness.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.530
The fire five years ago, which killed the count and his retainers,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.610
should have reduced it to mere ruins...

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.370
Come to think of it,

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.910
reports said that travelers and pilgrims often go missing in these parts.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.850
What a sad end for the former hounds.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.330
They're excited by the smell of blood.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.250
Impossible.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.690
How can such things...

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.820
...even exist?

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.490
That's why I called them miracles.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.850
How can you be terrified of such a great opportunity?

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.110
As a believer, don't you have some phrase?

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.960
You could say, "Dear God..."

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.270
I've had my fill of miracles.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.270
Enough to make me puke.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.930
Come with me, or you'll be devoured!

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.290
Where am I?

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.660
Man, that was tough...

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.520
What, you even brought the horse?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.770
Hey, Guts!

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.560
You seem not to have gotten it through your skull—

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.280
Yeah, I know...

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.430
I'll never forget that you brought me all the way here, horse.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.550
Very good.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.980
Man, those are a lot of heads.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.480
Humans, I tell you... Oh, Divine Lord, show mercy.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.010
What's wrong?

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.990
Oh, nothing really.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.100
What in the world is this?

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.160
What misshapen, abhorrent creatures...

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.010
Does this have to do with what Revelations foretold, as well?

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.510
Serpico?

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.520
Don't!

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.530
That idiot!

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.220
A man?

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.210
Who are you?

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.380
That's my line.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.800
I am this place's keeper of the hounds.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.310
Very well... First, untie me!

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.680
I'll see that you are rewarded handsomely for your aid!

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.850
I am...

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.700
I am in this state for reasons I cannot say,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.130
but I am a legitimate Holy See knight.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.890
I will ensure you are well-received.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.740
Meat... What?

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.190
It's easier to eat the way it is...

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.750
H-H-Hounds!

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.730
Don't be cruel to the hounds!

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.910
They're my... my family.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.370
Don't hurt them!

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.500
You... You'll pay for this!

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.150
Even the master of the house...

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.510
is fed to the dogs if he... if he is cruel to them!

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.520
You killed the master of the house?

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.730
No, I ate him.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.040
I... I haven't smelled anything this good in a long time.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.610
A high-quality noblewoman...

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:04.270
I kn-know... y-your smell... That was the best prey.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.580
You are a survivor from that day?

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.300
I won't be lame and try to go easy with my injuries.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.390
I couldn't care less if my arm gets ripped off.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.190
For the first time in a long while, I remember

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.490
how it felt at the start of all this.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.500
Thanks, it feels like crap.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.040
Me... Me, too.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.600
Thanks.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.430
See, he's finally here.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.850
My target, the one you wanted to know about...

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.200
The Apostle.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:49.860
Apostle?

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.890
That's right.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.010
Eradicating every last one of these Apostles...

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.520
That is my goal.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.790
Th-The moment that brand marked you...

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.220
Your... Your fate was set in stone.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.080
You're just p-prey... meat... hunted...

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.770
s-struggling... crawling!

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.240
Like I said... Don't be cruel to the hounds!

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:35.970
Guts, above you!

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.800
Right!

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.870
What's wrong with you, Guts?!

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.220
Do it like usual!

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.590
Meat... Meat!

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.960
Meat... Meat...

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.280
I'm tough and taste like shit...

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.650
It'll be fine.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.240
After eating you,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.200
I'll c-cleanse my palate... with the woman-meat.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.830
Th-That woman... is like the lady.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:32.300
A noblewoman... So soft.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.230
M-Melting in your mouth...

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.030
The lady?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.520
Th-The flavors are coming out.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:55.800
Humans who oppose us... are just food.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.760
I gotta say, when it comes to eating, you have no table manners.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.350
Yeah.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:07.020
M-Meat has high... and low grades...

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:14.400
People nice to me have... s-soft, sweet meat.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:21.430
M-Meat from those... who call me ugly... a-and inferior is low-grade!

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.660
Smelly meat... tough meat...

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.650
Then I doubt I'd taste good.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.840
No hurry.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.710
I'll know soon enough!

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.630
Hey, Guts!

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.840
Th-This is real.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.130
This is a real, preserved human being!

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.970
Don't touch her!

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.820
Don't... Don't touch the lady!

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.180
My lady!

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.080
Sh-She believed in me.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:57.180
They looked down... on me as ugly and inferior.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:04.970
The lady was the only one... who believed me, and I...

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.860
M-My lady!

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.100
So you dressed up the half-eaten remains as a tribute to her?

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.520
Talk about twisted to the core.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:26.820
Guts...

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.660
I will eradicate every last Apostle.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.520
I'll give you a clean death, so talk.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.020
How can I find them?

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.650
Them?

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.210
The God Hand.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.410
I... I don't know!

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.720
I know nothing about them.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:56.880
They are special... R-Really, I d-don't know!

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.730
I said I don't know!

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.070
I don't understand.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.100
I can't think of anything!

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.910
Not even a single prayer!

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.700
I... I don't... know...

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.950
I see.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.890
I'll ride this horse!

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:37.730
Nope.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.090
I'll ride woman.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.740
Female. Meat.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.340
Delicious!

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:01.710
No!

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.300
Don't run around if you want to live.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.370
Ye...

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.570
Yes.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.320
I'm just running around,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.190
trembling with fear.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.490
I couldn't even beseech God.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.510
And I call myself His servant...

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.990
I've said His name a million times.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.210
But I am only

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.860
weak,

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.750
wretched,

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.770
and powerless.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.710
Just powerless?

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.650
Just powerless, so you are innocent?

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.470
Don't deceive yourself with pretty words.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.060
Within you lies

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.120
a dark desire you cannot tell anyone else about.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.580
You felt it...

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.790
You felt a dismal lust as you struck that man.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.690
That wasn't the only time...

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.800
Even when whipping yourself in the name of atonement,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.250
you found pleasure within that agony...

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.850
There is no God in any of it.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.400
This festering desire is the only truth.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.530
God is too far removed from the likes of you.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.230
Guts...

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:06.630
Hey.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.700
What do you think you're doing?

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.080
Guts, she's...

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.600
You let yourself get possessed...

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.860
Pull this sword up very slowly...

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:50.110
Feel it with me... This pleasure.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.430
Slowly tear me apart.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.610
No!

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.010
Hey, you...

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.240
Kill him.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.750
Kill that man.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.520
Right now, right here!

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.910
Please calm down, Lady Farnese.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.870
I don't know what happened,

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.650
but our original mission was to capture him, remember?

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.890
You should avoid being swayed by—

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.890
I don't care!

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.850
Kill him!

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.330
To be blunt, I can't. Not me.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.680
You saw it yourself, Commander. He has superhuman strength.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.770
I'd just die a meaningless death—

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.320
Ow.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.770
Oh, Commander!

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.180
There you go, making our commander cry again.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.450
Not my problem.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.380
Well, we shall take our leave.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.120
That is, if you are willing to let us go.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.690
I think I owe you one.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.560
Well, I suppose so.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.080
Heh, fine.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.230
Not a bad move, drawing your sword like that.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.430
I'll say the same.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.160
You are formidable.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.590
So, till we meet again.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:29.940
Hey, wait!

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.470
For now, it is farewell.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.730
Same to you, pipsqueak.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.520
What a joker.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.950
But you know, I feel kind of sorry for that Farnese girl.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.430
She's like, all tightly wound.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.940
I'm the one who's wound up.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.950
First a ghost, and now a cleric.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.350
Talk about annoying.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:56.210
Commander, wait for me!

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.460
I have to kill him.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.200
I have to.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.190
I have to!

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.470
If I don't silence him...

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.970
If he continues to live, I...

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.310
They saw the same visions in their dreams.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.700
There were villages decimated by disease,

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.180
and nations overrun by armies that commanded giant beasts.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.150
There were cities crushed by earthquakes,

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.560
and towns swallowed by floods.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.510
The Sun hidden by a thick, black smoke,

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.440
and wandering throngs of starving people.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:52.440
There were bodies of entire families, and bodies of their neighbors.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.140
Each saw a myriad of varieties,

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.320
but all pointed toward a singular intent.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.000
Each enduring their own night,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.980
the people were trapped in true darkness

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.420
that enveloped their shared world.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.750
And amidst the ensuing chaos,

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.790
they observed with keen interest

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:18.810
a shining hawk, piercing the infinite gloom,

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.660
and descending upon the bloodstained land.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.510
They knew immediately

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.370
that this was their greatest desire.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.320
Charlotte... Charlo... Doctor?

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:42.720
Please bring his relatives.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.780
Quickly, I beg you.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.410
At last... At long last, we'll have a new queen.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.130
Her Majesty, Queen Charlotte.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.460
Given her nature, she will appoint a regent.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.540
We should plan accordingly...

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.470
Do those dolts even understand what's happening?

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.560
It was only thanks to His Majesty

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.790
that we survived the war with Chuder.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:05.750
The hawk...

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.390
The hawk will return.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:12.930
The hawk...

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.560
A strange hawk of light that

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.680
the people of Windham... nay, all of Midland saw in dreams.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.150
Though His Majesty was noble and just,

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.830
he became inscrutable in many of his actions after the Battle of Doldrey.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.590
The Band of the Hawk's alleged treason...

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.390
Did that really happen?

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.380
Your Highness, please open the door!

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.330
What is the matter?

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.330
General Laban, well,

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.980
Her Highness hasn't left her chambers in five whole days.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.940
Only her favorite lady-in-waiting is allowed to enter.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.340
She's trying to persuade Her Highness right now, but...

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.180
Your Highness... Your Highness!

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:07.820
Allow me!

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.090
Your Highness, His Majesty is in critical condition!

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.370
Your Highness!

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.500
Griffith...

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:21.130
Where are... you now?

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.760
Father!

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.890
His Majesty has passed away.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.320
Now, of all times?

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.890
What will happen now?

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.870
Please save me, Lord Griffith!

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.090
The mountain's moving.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.380
Is Casca alive?

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.470
I'll never lose her again.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.430
Come back again, no matter what.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.430
There is something I must do.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.440
You claim it's divine punishment?
