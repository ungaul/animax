WEBVTT

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.980
We finally found you, Black Swordsman!

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.490
Hey, look.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.810
Is that a sword?

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.990
No way... How could anyone wield that?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.490
This man is

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.000
the Hawk of Darkness.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.950
We are the Holy See's Holy Iron Chain Knights.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.010
We have made haste, by order of the Miracle Certification Bureau,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.180
to take you to the Holy See.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.010
You will not be harmed if you lay down your sword and surrender.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.180
If not, we swear upon God that you will be captured!

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.970
I don't recall doing anything that'd make a priest arrest me.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.300
How callous... What is all that blood from?

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.500
While tracking you,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.270
we saw the bodies of a monk, his daughter, and countless others.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.190
Guts... The time for talk is over!

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.280
This is God's will!

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.700
Troops, capture the Black Swordsman!

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.920
This doesn't look good... What are you gonna do?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.140
The Holy Iron Chain Knights

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.890
Listen, I'll create an opening.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.740
When I do, race through the forest.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.810
But... Don't get me wrong!

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.000
Do you really want to die like this, in the middle of nowhere?

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.660
A good blade should rest in a scabbard.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.740
You should return to the master of your sword!

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.020
What's his deal?

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.340
He can't use his sword at all.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.460
Guts!

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.210
I can't get a good grip.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.320
Great!

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.720
Have at him!

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.800
Idiot, don't kill him!

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.640
H-He's fast... Stop, you'll kill him.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.260
His false hand! Watch that hand!

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.700
Calm down! Don't get worked up!

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.560
Surround him! Don't let him move around!

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.140
We'll just hit each other...

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.090
No!

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.000
Idiots! We can't kill him!

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.420
The whole lot of you is pathetic...

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.920
How can a single fugitive have you in such disarray?

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.850
You can't blame them.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.750
The Holy Iron Chain Knights, also known as the "Spoiled Brat Knights,"

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.780
are full of pampered heirs their noble families wanted safe.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.760
They're here for the prestige and safety the order affords.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.950
Most have never fought in a real battle.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.350
Thank you for the lecture.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.170
So, why are you here, Sir Serpico?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.750
Oh, come now... I'm sure you know.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.990
I became an officer of arms because I hate the sight of blood—

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.570
Good... Now! Secure him!

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.800
Oh, crap.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.580
This is the Black Swordsman...

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.000
His malice is unmistakable.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.720
He is the one written of in Revelations.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.280
Lady Farnese...

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.400
As Serpico stated,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.470
given our troops' combat inexperience, we face mounting casualties

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.660
if we seek to overwhelm him with numbers.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.290
I ask that you allow me, Azan, to undertake this task!

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.220
Back, back!

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.420
Back, I say!

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.380
Vice-commander... Sir Azan!

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.470
I am Azan, Second-in-Command of the Holy Iron Chain Knights!

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.180
Wow, we'll never run out of surprises around here.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.920
Iron Staff Demon Azan?

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.200
I've heard of you.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.220
I believe you're also called the Knight of the Bridge.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.150
Oh?

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.360
You know this guy, Guts?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.310
The story goes that an injured old man was standing on a narrow bridge.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.760
The Knight of the Bridge was a curious guy,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.780
who refused to let an army of a hundred mounted men pass

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.660
because he was protecting that guy.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.030
That was a long time ago.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.920
People laughed and said he could've ended it by carrying the old man to the other side.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.900
A knight has a duty to uphold his code of chivalry!

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.910
My circumstances led to being a cleric knight.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.820
In any event, I have named myself.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.180
If you are a knight, courtesy demands you reciprocate!

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.850
I'm no knight... I'm Guts.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.680
Just "Guts," old man.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.690
Very well, Guts... Prepare yourself!

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.270
He's so old-fashioned.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.400
Prepare to break at least one or two bones!

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.860
One or two bones, eh?

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.620
I can't keep dodging with this gimpy leg.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.680
And the old man isn't just an idiot who relies on brute strength.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.000
You nimble trickster!

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.210
Summer Showers Thrust!

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.220
Vice-commander Azan!

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:57.800
I would commend you.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.310
But given your lack of offense, your execution lacks finesse.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.130
Your swordsmanship affirmed its battle-testing.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.280
I'll admit it thrilled me, hearkening to my own past.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.630
I must apply myself to the order with greater diligence,

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.700
to mend my foolish ways.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.450
Shit... I can barely feel my limbs anymore.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.560
What should I do?

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.900
A frontal attack?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.980
Commendable resolve!

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.080
What?

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.750
I was careless!

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.430
Lady Farnese!

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.490
I was the one who put him down?

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.650
Well done, Lady Farnese.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.580
You really are our Lady Commander!

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.370
Hey, you! Get up!

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.930
Wait, is he dead?

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.080
He's unconscious. He seems to be asleep.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.430
Oh, Tonio!

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.840
He was a good man...

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.130
Lady Farnese, please order a retreat.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.560
Lady Farnese, was this the first blood you've drawn?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.340
As one who wields a sword, you mustn't fear it.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.680
But always remember the weight of a life taken,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.570
so long as you have men under your command.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.410
What's this?

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.530
Very well!

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.910
All troops, retreat!

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.840
Hey, are you alive?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.170
Yeah, somehow.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.460
Well, you're a hard one to kill.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.650
Here.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.570
Good work.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.490
On the battlefield, a common soldier's life is worth less than a single silver coin.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.870
In this day and age, most people are

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.480
abused by royalty and the nobility.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.300
Well, not that even kings can live as they please.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.060
Everyone is merely swept along by the tide.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.510
The tide known as fate.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.840
And their lives spent,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.500
they vanish into its depths.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.130
They die before learning who they truly are.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.390
Some, regardless of rank or station, are born as key individuals,

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.990
who will shape this world.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.780
They are the true privileged class.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.250
I want to know who I am in this world.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.810
What I am capable of, and what I am meant to do.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.170
How strange.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.220
I've never spoken to anyone about this before.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.040
At that moment,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.770
the man appeared to me as something beautiful, noble, and absolute.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.710
We have brought the Black Swordsman.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.380
Enter.
Yes, my lady.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.410
Well done.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.050
After you bind him to the post, you are free to go.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.280
But that would—

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.260
No need for concern.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.450
With those gigantic shackles, what harm could he possibly do?

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.530
We shall inform the vice-commander, then.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.530
That won't be necessary.
But...

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.750
Further, instruct the guards to leave this tent until I order otherwise.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.000
But if something should happen...

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.570
We should inform the vice-commander.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.430
What is your name and rank?

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.460
You dare say you cannot follow my order

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.860
unless the vice-commander tells you to?!

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.150
Tell me, who is the Supreme Commander of the Holy Iron Chain Knights?

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.440
Yes, my lady! It is you, Commander Farnese!

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.730
I deeply regret speaking out of turn!

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.720
As long as you bear this in mind. Leave.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.190
Yes, my lady!

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.450
Black Swordsman...

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.410
Or should I say... Guts, was it?

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.350
Before we deliver you to the Holy See,

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.600
it falls to me, as one of the grand tribunal's junior members,

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.130
to ask you a few simple questions.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.710
Why do you laugh, cur?!

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.400
Oh, I was just thinking that I have the worst luck

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.890
with God and things of that ilk.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.100
Blasphemy. I shan't allow you to blaspheme a second time.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.600
The Band of the Hawk.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.020
A band of mercenaries, hired by Midland.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.820
The Band of the Hawk.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.630
An elite military force that won countless victories,

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.810
their military prowess was said to be peerless.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.290
But they plotted treason against the royal family, becoming wanted fugitives.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.640
However, the entire company vanished into thin air overnight.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.620
No one heard, even in rumors, that the bounty was claimed.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.630
Did someone obliterate them?

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.560
All we know is that there are very few survivors.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.360
Th-The leader of the Band of the Hawk was Griffith.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.300
After he went missing,

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.410
it's said a woman replaced him as their leader.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.760
It's also said that the captain of their raiders

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.450
wielded a massive sword and could slay a hundred men with ease.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.240
You seem to match his description.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.040
And if I recall, his name was...

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:32.770
Also...

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.140
A questionable item,

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.710
one that would conceivably be in a heretic's possession...

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.970
Nice, isn't it?

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.120
If this is a heathen idol,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.000
you will be tried as a heretic.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.610
If you do not wish to endure that, you should confess everything now.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.330
Is that not preferable to

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.210
being interrogated under torture, then burned at the stake?

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.660
Answer me, cur!

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.490
Do you believe in God and the devil?

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.010
What's your point?

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.980
Are you trying to blaspheme yet again?

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.830
Have you ever met God?

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.680
God does not show us His miraculous existence on this Earth so easily.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.120
Through our faith, God is always with us.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.420
In our souls and up in Heaven.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.430
Wh-Why do you laugh?

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.590
What a picture-perfect response.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.570
Did you learn that in a convent?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.940
On a battlefield, a nobleman said the exact same thing,

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.970
burning a city to the ground, with its women and children.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.090
I'm not talking about some shitty, useless god

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.950
who's just an empty decoration.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.560
A confession would be a waste of time.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.520
I have no intention of repenting,

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.760
and I don't think you'll learn anything, even if I told you.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.460
Just go say a prayer for me in some moldy temple, will you?

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.450
You cur!

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.590
You just had to say that?

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.390
Cur, how dare you blaspheme in front of me,

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.100
Commander of the Holy Iron Chain Knights?

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.150
I was prepared to show mercy,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:17.900
in consideration of your injuries, but no longer!

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.040
I shall make you talk,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.290
even if it means flaying the skin from your body!

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.140
I swear this by my faith!

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.240
You're trying way too hard, aren't you?

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.030
Be it God or your rank,

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.650
whatever weight you're trying to throw around won't earn loyalty.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.720
Not like that Knight of the Bridge commands.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.040
If you ask me,

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.730
you're just like that idol you worship, all empty inside.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.110
You... You!

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.560
How dare you?!

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.960
Lady Farnese!

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.790
Excuse me... Just what is going on?

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.580
Lady Farnese, what is the meaning of this?

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.130
Why all this commotion?

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.080
I am simply questioning him,

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.790
before we deliver him to the Holy See.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.570
However, this is... I am finished.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.160
Return him to his cell.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.720
You are dismissed, as well.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.040
Lady Farnese... Did you not hear me?

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.410
I said, you are dismissed!

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.440
As you wish.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.870
Do not unshackle him.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.810
Tend his wounds, and leave him in the cell.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:49.930
Take him!

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:50.820
Yes, sir!

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.710
Don't be so rough on our commander, please.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.830
She may not look it, but she can be quite charming.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.740
I can't afford to be wasting time here.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.560
Shit.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.070
I don't have time to be playing nice with these lunatics.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.520
Casca...

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.470
And...

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.360
It's nearly time.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.080
Shit...

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.580
Unarmed and imprisoned,

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.730
not to mention not in the best shape.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:51.340
What to do?

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.090
Hup!

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.040
I guess I had this guy.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.950
I'm here to save you, Guts.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.680
See, you can escape with this key.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.430
Why are you here?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.190
Elves have a strong sense of responsibility.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.190
What're you gonna do?

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.530
I'm getting my stuff back.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.150
It's everything I have, after all.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.330
But your weapons are in that woman's tent.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.840
That's perfect.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.760
Depending how it goes, we'll take her hostage.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.980
What?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.230
I don't give a rat's ass if I end up having to kill the lot of them.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.720
There's someone I need to find, no matter what.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.420
I don't give a damn what happens to those who try to stop me.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.550
What's going on?

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.590
Oh, God... Please guide me.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.100
You!

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.420
Oh, man... Charming, huh?

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.920
You were hurt pretty bad.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.940
You can't swing it around this soon. You'll reopen the wound.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.810
Guess I'm still at half strength.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.230
Lady Farnese, we have an emergency.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.600
The Black Swordsman has... You—

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.620
That's brutal.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.260
Guess I'll have to ask her along, after all.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.860
A fire!

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.490
The Black Swordsman has escaped!

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.500
Stop it from spreading to the other tents!

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.970
Lady Farnese!

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.230
You... How did you...

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.980
Step aside, old man.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.280
You think you can escape with those injuries?

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.430
Yeah, I do.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.870
The practice of burning people to death isn't limited to clerics, is it?

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:18.870
Well?

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.610
I'll burn her ass.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.320
Taking a woman hostage... You coward!

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.820
You leave us no choice.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.440
Fall back, everyone.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.600
Sorry.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.410
What have you done?

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.340
Don't worry.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.840
Hurry!

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.480
Gather the horses!

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.150
This is my biggest folly yet.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.310
We cannot let him escape!

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.420
Who's that?

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.280
You're unbelievable.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.120
Who do you think you have to thank for being able to run this far?

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:02.950
The horse.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.870
Then apologize to the horse.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.200
Sorry, horse.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.940
As long as you remember that.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.000
Hey.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.520
How the tables have turned, eh?

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.650
Quit struggling...

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.090
With your hands tied, if you fall on these rocks, you'll die!

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.180
Don't worry.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.520
We won't eat you or anything.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.860
Oh, I'm Puck.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.080
Let me go, cur!

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.240
How dare you treat the Commander of the Holy Iron Chain Knights this way—

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.220
Shut up.
Oh, hey!

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.560
Keep this up, and I'll just knock you out again.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.600
Sorry, you'll have to come along for now.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.480
And there's something I want to ask you.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.660
This is humiliating!

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.900
How could a heretic do this to me?

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.060
Let me down!

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.090
I'd rather fall and die than listen to you!

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.790
No!

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.120
Just calm down a bit, will you?

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.970
Jeez, isn't he capable of love for his fellow man?

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:51.810
Nope.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.020
Sorry, miss.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.920
How dare you? Don't mock me!

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.350
What are you doing?

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.370
She isn't looking.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:03.880
Huh?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.460
She isn't trying to see me.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.770
She can't... She can't see elves.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.540
Next Episode Preview

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.540
Does this have to do with what was foretold in Revelations, as well?

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.630
Be nice to dogs.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.590
I just remembered for the first time in a while...

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.600
Humans who oppose us are just food.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.600
I've had enough of miracles.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.110
