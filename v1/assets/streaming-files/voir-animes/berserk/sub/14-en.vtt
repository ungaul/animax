00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.620
In this world...

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.540
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.360
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.240
At least it is true...

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.410
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.950
Go back to the sheath that protects you.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.660
Go back to Griffith!

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.370
Don't glower at me like that.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.110
I'm offering you all the fun you want right before setting out for the afterlife.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.360
What's wrong? Are you embarrassed?

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.310
I'm unable to push this bastard aside...

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.270
My... My arm is so powerless...

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.340
Feel no shame about shape.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.290
Weather changes their phrase.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.020
Even mother will show you another way.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.420
So put your glasses on.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.490
Nothing will be wrong.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.690
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.530
It's up to you.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.190
The first words should be found.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.800
Whatever holds you back.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.470
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.310
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.410
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.380
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.180
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.420
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.050
It's too late.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.890
Bonfire of Dreams

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.470
Don't even think about biting your tongue off.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.940
It'd be a shame if you died before we finished our fun.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.150
Do you want to die in a place like this?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.080
Go back to the sheath that protects you.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.520
I won't bite my tongue off.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.790
Oh no, she's been driven to despair.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.600
Can't you resist a little so we can get turned on?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.670
But...

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.940
I won't let you rape me either!

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.830
What?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.740
Bitch!

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.330
You'll pay for that!

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.810
I'll kill you!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.660
You better lay off now.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.800
Judeau!

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.600
She's the only woman in our troop.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.700
It'll cost you.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.510
Unbelievable!

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.820
He's beaten almost half my hundred men in spite of his wounds...

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.720
I admit this is no fluke.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.790
What was that?

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.930
There are fifty of you still alive?

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.330
It'll be dawn by the time I get around to cracking all your heads.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.440
Don't let up!

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.540
He barely has the strength to stand!

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.840
Defeat him now!

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.680
What am I doing here?

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.960
In a miserable place like this...

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.960
It's not worth risking my life for this...

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.630
Am I fighting for Casca?

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.100
No, that can't be it...

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.980
I don't have time to think now.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.410
I should concentrate on wielding my sword...

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.240
...and killing... Nothing more...

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.060
Sorry I was late.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.970
It took quite a while to persuade those big shots we needed to rescue you.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.900
H-Hey...

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.070
You must run...

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.670
He... Guts...

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.010
Hurry!

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.810
What happened to Guts?

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.140
This way, quickly!

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.980
Someone, give her your shoulder!

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.920
I don't need it!

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.680
He...

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.450
He stayed to fight the enemy alone so that I could get away...

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.830
We've got to hurry, or...

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.700
Let's move!

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.270
Let us get there in time...

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.470
Please let us get there in time!

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.180
Here it is!

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.530
Oh, my God...

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.730
Is this for real?

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.780
I see almost a hundred men lying here.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.910
Did he really do all this by himself?

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.260
Guts...

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.060
Guts!

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.750
Guts!

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.120
Guts!

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.820
Those look like fatal wounds... Guts!

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.860
Come on, you're only joking, right?

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.120
Hey, Guts!

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.750
Guts!

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.390
Guts!

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.700
Stop shaking me...

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.870
It'll aggravate my wounds.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.300
Guts...

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.870
Out of the way now!

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.070
Move it!

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.640
It's an emergency!

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.740
Make way for us!

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.480
It's no big deal!

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.950
I can walk on my own!

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.920
Don't move. Your injuries will worsen!

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.950
Hey, they're back!

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.790
Damn it, he is alive after all.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.160
Guts!

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.400
Hey, ouch!

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.020
That hurts!

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.940
You'll heal faster without anesthetic, so just bear it.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.300
Shit!

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.310
I'm not a torn shirt you're sewing up!

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.770
Okay, I'm done now.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.910
What a guy!

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.150
With wounds like yours, most men wouldn't be able to stay conscious.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.080
How's his condition?

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:53.290
Well, he's no longer in danger, but I prescribe total bed rest for him!

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.360
Total bed rest?

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.330
Then what you're saying is...

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.330
In other words, he should not continue on this expedition.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.430
No way!

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.660
Bullshit!

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.330
I'll stick with you all until the end, even if I have to crawl after you!

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.500
Ridiculous!

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.550
If you go back into battle, I can't guarantee your survival.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.070
Guarantee my survival?

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.640
Whoever heard of a thing like that in battle?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.410
It's out of the question!

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.510
Oh, suit yourself!

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.420
Oh, well... We should be happy things ended up this way!

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.000
The two of you are back safe and sound.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.760
Where is Griffith, anyway?

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.730
Griffith is at headquarters for the war council.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.430
He set out this morning.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.310
Oh no.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.810
He won't come back until tomorrow.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.210
And they finally came back too.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.910
What bad timing!

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.390
Casca, aren't you going to get looked at?

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.860
I'm fine.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.090
After all... it's not as though I got wounded.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.400
But you had a fever, didn't you?

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.370
Oh!

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.800
What's going on?

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.350
Seriously, we were worried that the worst might have happened.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.550
For once, we need to thank Commander Guts.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.250
Sorry for having worried you all.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.990
I'm glad you're safe, big sister.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.720
But Captain Griffith is cold at heart.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.720
Even if he did have to attend a war council or whatever...

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:40.800
Watch your mouth.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.000
Oh, I am sorry, big sister...

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.170
Casca.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.880
Can I have your ear for a moment?

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.070
What's the matter?

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.010
Well, I want to tell you this.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.990
When I asked Griffith to send a search party to rescue you two...

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.560
...those nobles spoke against us, making objections of all kinds.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.760
But...

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.490
Griffith really put his foot down.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.600
Those two are key to us.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.560
I cannot afford to lose them.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.300
Griffith said that...

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.410
That's right. My hat's off to you two.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.080
To think that he values you so much he'd say something like that!

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.280
Honestly, I felt a little jealous.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.790
Oh, hey, I almost forgot about this.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.360
Give this to the big guy who killed a hundred men.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.260
It's medicine?

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.870
I got this from a company of traveling players I used to work for.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.210
You may not believe it...

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.710
...but it is made from fairy dust.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.140
Fairy dust?

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.450
That's impossible!

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.240
I know you doubt it.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.380
But it works wonders, and the effect is guaranteed.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.060
It saved my life a couple of times. Trust me.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.360
Such a precious thing of yours...

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:14.920
Don't worry.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.430
I think it's a fairly good deal, a hundred men for one pack of medicine.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.430
Thank you, Judeau.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:37.340
She's acting so girlish all of a sudden...

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.380
Guts...

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.840
Guts...

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.540
What's going on?

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.640
Wouldn't it be better if you slept?

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.820
I can't sleep because my body is burning.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.620
Up here I feel at ease, and it's much cooler.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.400
Hey... Don't move.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.110
The pain... ...is subsiding.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.250
What is this?

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.220
Judeau gave it to me.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.460
It's some kind of secret medicine.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.620
Now turn your back.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.730
You know...

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.740
...there's nothing for you to worry yourself over.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.210
I only did that for my own sake.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.150
It wasn't for you in particular.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.920
I'd rather fight with my sword than run away. It's my nature.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.790
That was the only reason...

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.460
You fought a hundred men with your sword because it's your nature?

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.730
Yeah, that's it.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.040
Besides, I had to give that bastard some payback.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:22.910
I don't recall anything clearly since I was caught up in swinging my sword.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:30.280
But to tell you the truth, I couldn't get something out of my head...

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.190
Fighting against a hundred men...

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.460
...means nothing... ...compared to what you are doing.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.230
Not only you, but Griffith too...

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.680
You two have something important enough to stake your lives on.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.720
I think it's great. I mean it.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.220
Compared to your purpose...

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.730
...my random battles against a hundred men or even a thousand...

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.990
...seem insignificant.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.220
Guts...

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.130
Some view, huh?

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.130
Gaston doesn't think he's very suited to army life.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.010
After the war...

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.410
...he wants to start a tailoring business with the money he's earned.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.440
He's good with his hands, though he may not look like it.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.840
Nichol proposed to a woman, but she refused.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.620
She didn't want to marry a common soldier.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.660
He wants to get promoted as soon as possible so he can ask her again.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.600
That's why he is reckless and tends to overextend himself in battle.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.430
It seems that everyone is still betting on their unrequited hopes.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.730
Looking over all of them from here, it makes me think that I can see...

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.610
...their little dreams and hopes...

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.850
...flickering in each light.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.160
Like a bonfire of dreams...

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.820
That was beautiful...

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.860
I thought it was the princess talking.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:17.690
Don't say that!

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.400
But you're right.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.630
I think that each one of them...

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.140
...shine their own wisps of light when they gather together.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:34.480
Yeah, and to keep those faint lights from withering out...

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.320
...they join their light with the strongest flame of all...

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.690
A powerful fire called Griffith...

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.250
But...

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.390
...you won't find my light among them.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:01.440
I guess I'm just someone who stopped to warm up by the bonfire.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.970
Guts...

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.650
As long as I have my sword to fight with, I know I can survive any battle.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.920
That's how it's always turned out for me till now.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.260
Before joining the Band of the Hawk, I alone always survived...

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.620
...even in hopeless, losing battles.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.600
It happened again this time...

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.930
But you know, surviving these battles really doesn't mean anything.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.010
I've been fighting for as long as I can remember.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.070
The mercenary leader who raised me...

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.440
...taught me nothing except how to wield a sword.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.940
I've never had anything except my sword.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.250
I don't want to die.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.480
But even still, throughout all this time...

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.860
I continue to fight...

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.590
...because wielding a sword is all I know.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.470
Back there, I was ready to commit myself solely to fighting...

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.310
...and leave it to others to find a real reason to fight for.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.200
Guts...

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.640
Anyway, I guess all that sounds kind of dumb.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.840
I'm wondering why I told you all that...

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.780
Pretty pathetic.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.520
I'm wondering the same thing.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.030
Guts... ...are you thinking of...

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.800
Are you going to leave the Band of the Hawk?

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.210
Guts...

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.850
I said that I was going to fight in this war until the end, no matter what.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.580
What will you do afterwards?

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.220
Guts!

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.430
Casca!

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.260
Griffith is back!

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.730
He heard that you were safe...

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.390
...so he changed his schedule to come back here a day early!

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.000
Welcome back!

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.330
Captain!
Glad you're safe!

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.770
Oh, Commander Guts!

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:26.850
Hey.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:34.790
Griffith, I apologize.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.650
I held everyone back. It's my fault...

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.360
Despite my physical condition...

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.130
...I went into battle and made a mess of things.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.970
I even put my entire company in danger.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.640
Not only that, I put Guts and his Raiders at risk as well.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.080
I'm not qualified to be a commander!

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.310
I will accept any punishment...

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.570
W-What are you doing, you idiot!

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.850
Welcome back.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.230
Go for it, Commander!

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.640
Jump on me too!

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.270
All right, let's all go and get a drink!

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.590
Are you sure, Commander?

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.070
In your condition?

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.810
Shut up, the alcohol will disinfect my body from the inside!

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.510
I'm not responsible for this.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.280
Let's celebrate the hundred-man fight!

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.050
What's the matter?

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.220
Nothing...

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.280
Is he...

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.650
...serious about leaving?

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.110
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.750
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.790
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.760
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.020
What is that?

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.290
It's just the same.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.460
What is trying your crown?

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.640
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.970
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:36.950
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.680
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.350
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.160
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.860
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.530
Next Episode

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:12.740
There are things that man must one day put behind him once and for all.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:18.380
There are barriers that man must one day find a way to overcome.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.520
Head held high, eyes on the horizon, he will move forward...

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.290
In the eyes of the young...

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:30.500
...how transient is life and death?

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.550
The Decisive Battle
