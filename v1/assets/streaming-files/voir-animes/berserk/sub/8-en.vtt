WEBVTT

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.000
Reunion in the Den of Evil

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.290
It's him... Why is he here?

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.320
The Black Swordsman...

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.610
We're getting out of here, Isidoro.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.670
Make sure those two get out.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.360
Right! You can count on me!

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.670
I found an escape route in the back.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.630
You're gonna owe me.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.120
I charge high interest.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.240
Save the talk for after we get out alive.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.000
I'm so tired!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.880
I bet I broke the sound barrier.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.870
It appears they're fighting off heretics.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.930
That does not mean they are our allies.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.180
Have you all forgotten?

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.390
He's taken the lives of our comrades.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.630
What should we do?

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.520
Should we also capture the Black Swordsman, Lady Farnese?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.390
That will not be necessary.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.350
We are in the midst of battle!

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.900
Kill all who do not offer their surrender!

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.570
Lady Farnese, if I may...

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.240
We are to take the Black Swordsman alive—
Silence!

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.970
If we do not act, we shall only suffer more casualties!

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.470
There is no doubt they are heretics.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.870
Annihilate them, along with the Black Swordsman!

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.250
We have pledged our swords to God. We cannot allow ourselves to fear!

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.380
All troops, attack!

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.200
So, fight fire with fire, huh?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.250
Don't get distracted.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.040
Let's go.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.720
Show us the way, Isidoro!

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.960
No!
Do not let him get away!

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.790
Lady Farnese!

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.970
Oh, dear...

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.730
It's up there.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.280
Won't let you have witch... Consummate... Mine...

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.030
Stay back.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.730
Without Godo's armor, my spine would've been snapped in half.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.810
Make him into goat stew!

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.690
Isidoro, take those two and go ahead.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.730
But...

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.140
I'm leaving Casca to you.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.240
Fine... Don't die!

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.620
Wait... Leave her!

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.840
You keep forcing Casca away from me.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.930
You're like a half-Apostle.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.340
I guess your being here means there's some truth to the old skeleton's words.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.810
Kill.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.350
Trample you... Skewer you!

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.180
But I can't leave her behind in such a foul place.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.220
This time, I'll take her with me for sure!

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.210
Looks like one or two arrows have no effect.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.680
Guess I'll give this a try.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.350
One...

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.710
Two.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.020
Three.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.630
These explosive bombs aren't bad.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.160
Lady Farnese, in this chaos, it is too dangerous

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.710
for our commander to endanger her own person in battle!

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.240
Please retreat to the cave entrance!

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.260
But... Escort the commander!

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.960
Yes, sir!

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.220
Come, Lady Farnese.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.740
Azan!

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.500
Leave the rest to me!

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.950
Let me go!

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.830
Come with me, Officer of Arms!

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.630
Serpico, where are you?

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.760
I hope they didn't fall.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.650
I have been waiting for you, Black Swordsman.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.710
Huh?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.550
Wait a...

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.220
That was uncalled for.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.720
What was that sound?

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.210
Don't talk to me right now...

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.590
Hey!

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.840
There's no path!

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.000
Were the heretics planning to escape by jumping off or something?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.710
What now, monkey pants?

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.730
Hey, look.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.180
I see!

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.290
With this, we're golden!

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.820
No way.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.230
I can't do this.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.680
It'll be fine.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.960
I'll lower the rope.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.270
Just like lowering boxes.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.030
But... If it doesn't work for you, jump.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.240
Okay, I'll do it.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.000
This lady's the problem... I'm getting sucked in!

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.380
Damn.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.210
On principle, I prevent people from drawing their weapons.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.110
Either way, you can't swing that sword of yours here.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.590
Bastard...

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.320
I made the right choice, getting ahead of you.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.080
To think I'd chance upon such perfect terrain to fight you.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.400
I suppose this might be a sign of God's grace.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.440
Above all...

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.520
Trying to overwhelm you with sheer numbers is madness.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.810
If you can cut down ten men with that sword,

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.360
it's enough to change the tide of battle in an instant.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.410
Allies infected by fear are even worse foes than the enemy.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.530
He's good.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.430
I can't even get a chance to draw my blade!

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:59.630
You provoke our Lady Farnese a bit too much.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:01.460
I have to get rid of you!

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.210
Don't look down.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.720
Don't look down.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.350
Don't look down...

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.710
I'm falling!

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.920
I reached the bottom.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.440
I'm okay.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.400
Good.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.570
All right, don't struggle...

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.740
The westward sun, shining in your eyes.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.030
The cramped, unstable footing.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.080
Your hulking body, encumbered by armor.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.410
Your sword arm, made useless by the rocks.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.290
They all serve to shackle you!

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.280
He's not just a glib talker.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.500
He's highly skilled with his sword.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.120
His attacks are so versatile, I can't predict them.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.470
He's a far more challenging foe than that half-Apostle earlier!

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.300
Right now, I can't waste time here!

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.040
Are you worried about those girls?

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.480
My comrades are waiting for them up ahead.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.090
I'm sure they have already been taken into custody!

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.820
That's a total bluff... I need you even more on edge.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.320
I don't think I can win in a fair fight.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.420
How foolhardy... Fool? Not as much as you think.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.930
If I were to pull back my blade, your fingers would—

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.280
I have my reflexes. And my strong arms.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.190
Also, I have really thick skin on my palms.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.580
I didn't expect him to dodge like that.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.050
On top of that, he moves like a pickpocket.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.010
His quick wits let him use a weapon he's only seen once.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.370
He's more cunning than I thought.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.810
Like a fox.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.470
I shouldn't do things so out of character...

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.920
Really, it's unlike me to get so worked up.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.400
With this many men,

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.880
how could you fail to capture the Black Swordsman,

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.040
much less prevent him from entering the cave?!

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.630
I am deeply sorry.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.760
We were taken by surprise.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.680
I shan't tolerate excuses!

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.830
She's pretty unhinged...

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.270
And her flunky's nowhere to be seen, either.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.220
What is it?

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.270
Nothing.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.690
I just thought I saw something.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.800
Just a little more.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.380
Hang in there.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.310
Is someone there?

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.250
Joachim...

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.330
What?

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.070
Did they find us?

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.990
Joachim, you're alive—

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.980
Heretics!

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.120
There are heretics behind those rocks!

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.000
What?

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.280
Joachim...

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.300
Hey, lady! Run!

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.340
If you stand there, they'll catch you!

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.190
What're you doing, Casca?

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.430
This is bad, Isidoro.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.780
I'll go!

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.650
Commander,

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.540
our work to quell the heretics is nearly complete.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.520
What of the Black Swordsman?

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.410
He has not been seen among the captured or the dead.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.550
Walk!

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.280
That girl...

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.090
The one the Black Knight leapt to save.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.810
Sorry.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.140
Listen!

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.400
If we haven't returned by morning,

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.910
you have to leave Albion.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.920
If you dawdle, the officials will find you right away.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.030
Luca...

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.230
You should change your mind.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.230
I can't guarantee your survival, and you'll hold me back.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.020
My, so negative.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.650
Yeah, this isn't a job for a lady, Luca!

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.980
That goes for you, too.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.360
I'm doing this for my own reasons!

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.760
I'm gonna make up for my mistake!

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.240
I wasn't on top of my game earlier,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.990
but that'll change this time.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.160
You aren't the only one who's worried about those girls, you know?

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.500
Besides, the monastery owes me one.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.210
Depending on how it goes, we might avoid bloodshed.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.460
Do what you want.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.510
Do you think it'll work?

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.100
I have no idea.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.570
I think they should give up.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.420
Once someone's inside that tower, there's nothing to be done.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:43.030
Luca's so stubborn... She's way too responsible!

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.410
What do we do if they don't come back?

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.360
I don't know, silly!

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.970
Please return Luca and everyone safely to us, oh...

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.870
Um...

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.090
Um...

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.880
A shadow will be born.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:15.510
It will simply be a shadow cast by a dying sun that shines on a faraway land.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.130
We are already caught in the whorls of karma.

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:26.500
What should I do?

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.160
I lost them.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.170
With so many people here, I can barely sense their presences.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.200
Huh?
What's wrong?

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.810
I thought I saw something there.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.280
Maybe you saw a bat?

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.600
And I'm still visible, even in this giant temple.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.200
Anyway, why is it so hard to breathe here?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.650
Is this a lair of demonic creatures? Even that wouldn't explain all of it.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.540
Many things are much more sinister.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.620
I have a really bad feeling about this.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.050
I need to find the girls soon!

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.740
Help...

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.030
Help, Luca...

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.110
Elaine, aren't you a witch?

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.820
Can't we use your witchcraft to escape?

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.720
Hey, listen!

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.590
If we don't escape soon, we'll be in big trouble!

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.210
Ugh, give me a break!

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.930
Whatever... I don't care anymore!

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.800
It's all your fault.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.300
Since you came into my life, nothing good has happened.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.160
Only horrible things.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.350
I took care of you, didn't I?

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.350
But look at me now.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.540
Why is this

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.530
always happening to me?

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.730
Sorry.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.440
That's a lie.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.920
I'm sorry, Elaine.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.410
Please forgive me.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.570
One of you, out.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.540
Don't care who.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.860
Hurry up.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.130
You, come.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.620
Elaine...

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.580
You, never mind.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.390
I choose you.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.870
Your friend was getting taken away,

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.640
but you didn't try to help her at all.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.050
You only thought of yourself.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.610
I hate cowards like you!

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.950
But...

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.150
Wait!

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.410
I'm not like that... Come out!

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.450
Elaine!

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.720
I... I...

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.340
Why?

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.750
Is it my fault?

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.740
Am I the one who's wrong?

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.290
But I couldn't say anything.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.010
I was so scared.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.460
I wanted to live, even if it meant abandoning half-witted Elaine.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:14.800
Even though I'm like this and may die soon.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.850
No, that's why I want to live!

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.070
I'm horrible...

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.020
God is punishing me.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.660
Our investigations revealed there is an actual witch.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.120
We've looked into all the other women.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.000
One of you is the witch.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.020
He's talking about Elaine!

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.580
If I tell him everything now, maybe they won't hurt me.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.480
If I tell him...

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.280
In the end, everyone looks out for themselves.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.030
No way will I abandon anyone.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.890
Not you or Elaine.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.430
Luca...

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.330
Give me your strength...

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.620
I only need a tiny bit.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.620
Just a small part of your courage!

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.240
No!

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.850
Just walk.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:40.900
No!

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.410
I can't...

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.450
I just can't!

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.970
Luca!

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.660
Wow!

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.130
It's ridiculously big up close!

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.920
More like a fortress than a holy temple!

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.160
Shh.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.030
Keep your voice down.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:10.960
What is it?

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.680
My brand's throbbing.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.620
An Apostle?

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:16.950
No,

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.440
more monstrous than that.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.070
There's something very wrong here.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.420

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.420
I have witnessed a miracle!

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.510
I have found that faith means death!!

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.470
Fool, you seek to rebel against God!!

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.470
Impertinent witch!!

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.480
I will have you atone with blood.
