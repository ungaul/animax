WEBVTT

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.140
Hurry up!

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.090
Burn her!

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.480
We'll be saved if we burn her!

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.900
Out of the way!

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.500
It's just like that time.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.380
It's going to end the same way.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.780
Thank you.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.390
If you want to live, you will leave this land at once.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.730
As much as I want to get the hell out of here...

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.400
I can't.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.840
Not to mention that it doesn't seem I can do anything about this alone.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.900
I might just be trying to act tough,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.030
but I have to go.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.780
I see.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.280
Thanks for everything, Death... See you!

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.540
It's as though she's going to go take care of a trivial matter.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.220
Is that a fool's courage or...

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.800
No matter.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.550
Everything is following the same path as before.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.010
Unfortunately, no man possesses the means to change this festival's outcome.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.900
We are already caught in the whorls of karma.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.060
Shadows of Ideas

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.480
Soon...  Very soon, my life will also end.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.340
That is when...

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.330
Ultimately, I want see my world from above as it's destroyed.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.360
If, like those inquisitors, I had met that priest,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.480
would my life have been any different?

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.520
Would I have been a someone, who had encountered another?

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.000
But I met no one...

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.560
Actually,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.980
I existed only to look down upon this world from my summit of loneliness.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.180
I believe that now.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.130
This world that existed only for me to look up to, as it looked down upon me.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.450
This is enough... Let it all end.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.900
This infant saved that witch numerous times.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.810
This is a body of flesh, but it is not human.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.300
It is dying.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.100
You are the same as me, grotesque infant?

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.660
Let us go together.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.770
At least,

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.190
you can dream, using the new world within me as your cradle.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.270
You stupid people!

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.630
You're doing the same thing as those cultists!

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.280
What are you going to do?

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.770
I don't think throwing rocks will work this time.
Hurry it up!

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.860
But wow, I can't believe we're all alive.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.240
Come on! Walk faster, you cultist!

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.750
Listen, we'll run at the first chance we get.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.000
Are you all right?

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.020
I can't believe we got stuck walking with these two...

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.820
I don't think they've figured us out,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.470
but I've got to think of a way to get out of here fast—

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.880
Hey, old man!

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.760
You showed up at the perfect time!

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.320
Wh-Who's that boy? That brat... Huh? I can't hear you!

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.520
Just come here, and help me out!

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.270
I'll just go see what's going on. If you'll excuse me!

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.020
That stupid brat!

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.700
Are you all right with this?

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.100
Burn! Burn her!

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.530
Hurry up and do it!

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.730
Now, hurry... Light the purifying flames.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.120
Father Mozgus!

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.280
The whorls of karma... However... Hey, are you serious?

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.010
I've been falling a lot lately,

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.870
so I've been getting damn used to it!

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.020
It doesn't mean

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.940
all of it...

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.370
Now, girl!

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.650
...will be the same.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.120
That will not be!

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.470
You will not escape.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.400
On the contrary,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.810
you may not be the shadow on the water.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.520
But a fish that breaks the water's surface.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.030
Something black just... Father Mozgus!

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.270
Father Mozgus!

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.200
The great angel... The great angel was defeated!

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.980
The great angel... That black demon!

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.400
What?

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.680
I just saw something from the corner of my eye.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.300
That's...

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.650
Casca!

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.640
Don't think that I'm gonna let you keep stealing her!

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.290
Is an angel supposed to take a cut of the action from a thief?

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.340
Another one's coming!

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.400
This brat is the only criminal here! Please spare me!

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.300
What?

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.250
Stay back, stay back, stay back, stay back!

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.570
Old man...

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.620
Now, I've done it...

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.260
There's no way for me to get out of this now.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.510
You fool who fears not God...

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.840
You will swiftly receive divine punishment!

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:10.020
In God's stead, I shall punish you.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.900
Behold! Father Mozgus has revived!

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.780
He plans to fight that demon for our sakes!

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.610
Father Mozgus... Your form...

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.280
An angel?

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.540
No, more like a monster.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:29.140
No matter how much of your evil strength you use, it is futile.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.630
Behold!

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.340
This is what deflected that impure blade.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.290
This is the source of my faith!

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:46.060
As long as I hold the scripture to me, harming my body is impossible.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.320
The scripture's been cut through...

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.820
So that monster's basically just super hard?

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.410
You twins! Capture the witch!

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.530
The rest can die by the saw.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.580
Hey!

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.290
The fact that you still live

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:11.020
means that my four disciples have been summoned to Heaven...

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:24.010
I shall tear you limb from limb as a tribute to them!

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.360
His strength equals that of an apostle. And he's even tougher.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.420
Come, mighty strength! Come, superhuman strength!

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.110
Shit! They're coming again!

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.740
Now, now, if you don't pay attention...

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.410
God Thousand-Strike Cannon.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.750
God Breath!

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.400
I'll shut that mouth of yours, so you never utter a stupid sermon again.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.610
How's that?

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.070
That will not suffice...

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:28.000
to cut through the armor I have received

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.250
from God!

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.230
He probably won't have a chance to lend us a hand...

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.320
Quit whining!

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.030
Thanks to Guts, we only need to deal with two of them.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:07.240
And whose fault is it that I'm in this mess? Damn it...

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.870
If I stay here any longer, I'll be killed along with them.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.670
I'm sorry, Elaine!

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.930
You idiot!
No, wait.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.940
Are you all right?!

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.650
She's alive. I still feel her presence.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.240
Hey, stop...

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.030
Damn it, they're just hovering above us!

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.700
If we could just stop their movement for a second...

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.160
Leave that to me!

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.670
I'm not doing it anymore.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:59.090
Wait! At this rate, I wouldn't mind help from an elf!

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.130
At this rate?

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.510
Well, sorry! Look, they're coming! What're you gonna do?!

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.680
Mark this well, monkey child!

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.390
Behold the sight of the true ruler of the skies!

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.100
Puck Spark!

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.190
He actually... did it!

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.250
You're truly a terrifying brat.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:39.080
The twins... How dare you?

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.050
Curse you!

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.550
Do you not fear God?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.390
You dare get in the way of my holy mission, you devils?

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.890
If you want to appease your God so much,

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.600
why not split your head open and offer it up?!

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.520
I won't let you lay another finger on that woman.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.700
It's moving again!

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.000
Father Mozgus!

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.290
Save us!

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.380
Oh, God!

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.790
Great angel!

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.090
Save us!

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.680
God Thousand-Strike Cannon.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.100
I can't dodge completely.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.520
And my attacks have no effect.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.140
What am I supposed to...

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.660
It feels like being punched by a boulder.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:59.920
Can you not hear those voices praying?

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.170
All of those here, right now,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.420
have made their hearts one, praying for salvation.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.640
Are you saying you do not care if the lives of the thousands

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.940
of true believers are lost in exchange for that evil witch's life?

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.060
Stop being so pretentious!

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.150
How will burning the lady save all those idiots?

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.150
Please hurry!

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.190
Please burn the witch!

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.180
Shut the hell up.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.950
All they do is pray...

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.710
When they're in trouble,

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:47.170
all they do is try to save themselves...

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:53.930
Those tens of thousands don't have the right to depend on a single woman!

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.600
Prayer is the sign of faith itself!

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.600
You must pray and offer yourself to God.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.310
That is true faith!

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:08.610
You brazen fool, who knows not prayer, repent!

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.550
God Pressure!

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.560
An unbeliever like you will never witness miracles.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.320
Repent by throwing yourself into the purifying flames!

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.820
I tend to act first,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.290
rather than wait for some great miracle...

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.080
I think your scripture is about to let you down.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
You're protecting yourself with what you believe in most.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.970
But if you look at it another way, that's your weak point.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.200
If you meet your God, say this for me...

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.490
Leave me the hell alone!

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:45.830
Oh, God... I am coming home to you...

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:54.090
Allow me, at least, to... take this heathen with me!

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.220
I'm gonna pass.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.600
It's your time to shine for your faith in God.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.430
But I'll be punished if I intrude.

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.110
Fly up to heaven...

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.490
by your own damned self!

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.890
N-No!

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.950
Oh, God!

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.080
It hurts!

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.080
Why?

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.210
Someone... It's so dark.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.920
Starving... Damn it!

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.550
Damn... Kill her!

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.470
Kill that woman!

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.300
Please!

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.640
Would you shut your... You fool!

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.850
Hurry!

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.690
Casca, are you okay?

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.030
Whoa! Casca!

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.550
The tower!

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.590
Run into the tower!

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.970
Head up higher!

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.470
The front's no use!

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.600
Head to the back!

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.060
Vice-commander, the masses are flooding into the tower.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.520
There is no other path.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.940
We have no choice... Retreat!

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.520
All units, cover the masses!

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.110
But there are monsters in the tower!

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.650
It's better than being here!

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.700
Do not falter. Get as many inside as you can!

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.660
Vice-commander!
What?

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.000
Wait!

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.210
Many people are still out here!

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:32.500
Who cares?

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.960
Hurry up and shut the doors!

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.250
Shut them! Hurry!

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.050
Wait! There are still women and children!

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.250
Let us in!

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.760
No...

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.600
How could this have happened again?

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.140
Vice-commander, what should we...

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.730
Form up, and protect the women and children!

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.400
Only those who do not lose hope until the very end are true knights.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.990
Listen well. Now is the time that we show what true knights are!

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.700
Yeah!

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.700
Crap... At this rate, it's gonna climb up here!

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.710
Maybe it's about time that I leave.
Damn it, what are we supposed to... Fire.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.500
Look.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.880
I get it... The creepy-crawly blob is avoiding the fire...

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.260
Seems he was more useful in death.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.930
Father Mozgus...

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.520
If you don't want to die, pick up one of those.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.190
I don't do well with fire... Like that matters!

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.520
All right!

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.860
Hey...

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.900
Rather than staying up here, why not head into the tower?

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.950
That'd be like jumping into a feeding trough.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.660
Most of that will undoubtedly go into the tower.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.330
No point in holing up there, when that'll just break through.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.250
Not to mention, it'll be dawn soon.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.130
That thing will either disappear or weaken when the sun hits it.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.420
But there won't be any sunlight in the tower.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.220
The sun will shine brightest here.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.720
We just have to last until morning.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.600
We're going to survive.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.110
We'll cut through to our survival.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.690
Cut through!

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:01.460

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.460
Being scared means that I want to live!!

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.550
I had forgotten.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.510
That this is a world where the sun rises...

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.510
They're celebrating?!

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520
Everything is being fulfilled by one voice.
