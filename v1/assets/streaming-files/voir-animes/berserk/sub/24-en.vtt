00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.760
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.650
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.490
At least it is true...

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.560
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.110
What the hell happened?

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.470
Feel no shame about shape.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.420
Weather changes their phrase.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.150
Even mother will show you another way.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.550
So put your glasses on.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.620
Nothing will be wrong.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.820
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.660
It's up to you.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.320
The first words should be found.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.930
Whatever holds you back.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.600
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.440
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.540
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.510
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.310
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.550
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.180
It's too late.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.050
The Great Eclipse

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.730
What is this?

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.400
Where the hell are we?

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.400
Hey!

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.860
Weren't we just riding over grassy plains?

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.490
Or were we just dreaming as we rode along?

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.490
Or without realizing it... ...d-d-did we all just die?

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.750
Calm down!

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.790
Calm down?

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.040
How the hell are we going to calm down?

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.000
Quiet!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.210
Everyone, compose yourselves!

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.260
Forget about what you can't understand!

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.220
Focus on what you can do!

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.430
Everyone, make a tight formation!

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.090
No one is to stray from the group!

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.180
Guts, get Griffith on your horse!

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.220
Got it!

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.350
Hurry up, over there!

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.980
Even under these circumstances...

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.060
She's one hell of a woman.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.400
All right, Griffith, here we go.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.150
What is this doing here?

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.530
I know for sure Griffith didn't have it when we rescued him.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.080
And it's such a strange shape...

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.420
Griffith.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.380
The time has come...

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.260
Time for the great festival of darkness...

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.390
The banquet that happens only once every 216 years...

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.600
The Great Eclipse!

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.480
Where did they come from...

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.270
What the hell are they?

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.450
They are coming... They are near...

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.780
The rulers of the supreme beings...

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.240
It is the advent of the four guardian angels!

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.250
What the... What is it?

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.840
A giant?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.880
One after the other... I'm dreaming...

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.590
This has to be a dream!

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.550
What now?

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.630
What the hell is going on?

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.140
It is now time for the great blessing.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.850
We thank you all for gathering here...

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.890
...in this sacred time and place for the final chapter.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.520
O unholy lambs, children of man...

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.650
Come and enjoy this divine banquet...

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.910
Chosen by the laws of causality...

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.450
Our Apostle, our Hawk!

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.660
You are the appointed one.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.080
Here in this place, in this moment...

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.250
You who have been chosen by the hand of God.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.840
You, our kin.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.260
Our long-awaited blessed king!

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.680
Griffith?

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.600
Kin?

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.640
Griffith is a...

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.060
Cut the crap!

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.690
First you drag us to this godforsaken place...

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.490
And now you think you're going to have your way with him?

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.280
Apostle?

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.320
Kin?

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.030
Don't be ridiculous!

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.330
There's not one shred of him that resembles the likes of you!

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.960
How dare you say he's one of you monsters!

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.040
Guts!

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.010
What a beautiful friendship.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.140
You will certainly be an excellent living sacrificial offering...

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.640
A living sacrifice?

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.850
Yes.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.600
The precious living sacrifice needed for him to become a demon king.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.570
Demon king... Living sacrifice?

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.440
Exactly.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.740
From the moment you took hold of the Crimson Behelit...

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.700
...you became deserving of the title demon king.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.910
In fact, it is because you inherently possessed...

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.540
...the requirements that it fell into your hands.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.550
And the fact you used the behelit to summon us...

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.470
...is proof that you are entitled to become one of us.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.810
All the corpses that have gathered here have used behelits...

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.600
...to take on the forms they were destined to assume.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.690
You don't mean that...

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.940
All of you are really...

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.360
And the behelit you hold in your hand is no ordinary behelit!

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.660
The Crimson Behelit falls...

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.530
...only into the hands of us guardian angels, those destined to become...

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.080
...members of the God Hand.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.960
The Egg of the King.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.090
And all of you are here to serve as living sacrificial offerings...

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.050
...for the christening of this angel...

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.340
You're saying that you will transform Griffith into one of these beasts?

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.800
In exchange for our lives?

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.050
Not quite.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.010
It will be his will, not ours.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.430
It is he who will offer you as living sacrifices...

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.430
That's impossible...

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.020
It's impossible.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.440
It is all fixed in the flow of causality...

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.530
His fate was decided long ago.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.570
Your lives were all destined to come together at this sacred moment...

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.030
...the sacrificial ceremony.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.120
We will now begin the baptism ceremony.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.160
Bring him to the altar!

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.630
What the...

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.810
Guts!

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.020
Griffith!

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.570
Baptism!

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.530
Baptism!

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.920
Are you afraid?

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.550
Of us?

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.300
Of those who are infinitely more powerful than you?

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.930
Of our almighty power?

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.520
Or are you afraid of what lies ahead?

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.980
Before we venture into the future, let us travel back once more...

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.730
...to the landscape of your past...

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.820
And by doing that, you shall see the truth.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.690
And see exactly what it is you are...

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.410
What?

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.330
Did everyone go home?

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.750
We all said we were going to see the castle.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.500
Oh well... I'll go by myself.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.180
Hey, where am I?

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.560
I think I'm lost.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.520
Hey, old lady.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.020
Which way is the castle?

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.770
This way?

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.150
Thank you.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.240
Yes, yes.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.950
Your friends went ahead. They'll be waiting.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.050
I think I've ended up somewhere I shouldn't be.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.640
Hey, anybody there?

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.610
What a noisy child!

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.360
Old lady, it's horrible!

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.570
There are so many dead people... I know...

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.370
You know?

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.410
That's terrible. You knew, and you lied to me.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.120
I didn't lie.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.210
This is the only path that leads to the castle.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.540
The only path...

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.300
Those heading toward that castle must either trample over the fallen...

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.510
...or else become one of them too. It's one or the other!

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.020
See here. It's your friend!

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.900
Y-You're...

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.440
You're going to the castle to become king, aren't you?

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.030
You're amazing!

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.620
I want to be a knight one day... See?

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.410
Hey...

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.540
Take me with you.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.160
I'll give you this if you do.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.330
I promise I'll work hard.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.750
All right?

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.880
No... What?

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.970
Why not?

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.140
I can't... Because you're already...

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.640
You're already dead...

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:43.520
Take us with you too... We want to fight with you...

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.610
I have faith that you can make it to the castle...

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.990
I would love to see the empire you'll build...

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.740
I want to fight under your flag...

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:55.490
No...

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.240
I can't... I can't take you with me...

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.410
You're all dead...

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.670
None of you are alive anymore!

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.920
That's why I can't take any of you to the castle!

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.590
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.390
My, my... what a silly child you are!

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:19.140
After all, you're the one who did this to all these people!

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.390
Isn't that so?

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.350
They ended up this way because they were following your lead.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.270
If you hadn't said that you wanted to venture up there...

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.900
...then none of this would have happened.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.610
But...

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.490
I never forced anyone to come along...

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.030
Oh, what a thing to say!

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.950
How do you think you were able to come this far?

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.620
Listen now!

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.420
This path that you've chosen...

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.540
...is paved with those people's bodies.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.460
And that's not all.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.720
Those people have piled on several times more bodies...

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.470
...than just the ones you started with...

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.930
...so that you could get where you are now.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.720
There, take a look...

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.680
If you're to make it all the way to the castle...

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.610
...you'll need to pave your path with more and more bodies!

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.070
What's wrong?

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.860
Are you scared now?

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.570
Do you want to turn back now?

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.320
You can't think like that!

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.740
If you succumb to your fears...

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.540
...you'll end up as one of those bodies yourself!

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.920
Look closely now at your own hands.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.380
My hands!

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.340
What a silly boy!

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.180
If you were going to regret your actions...

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.350
...you never should've come here in the first place.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.520
Things are not easy here, you know!

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.770
Why couldn't you be satisfied with just gazing at the castle from the alleyway?

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.950
I had no...

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.030
I had no idea!

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.410
Be quiet!

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.620
You must have known what kind of place this was!

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.920
Yes, I've known... ...all along...

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.300
...and walked all over them...

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.090
...to get here...

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.640
What's holding you back after all this time?

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.930
This is the path that leads to your dream, isn't it?

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.400
That's what you believe, right?

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.150
So what's causing you to hesitate now?

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.360
That's right. Pile them up even higher!

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.110
It's not too late.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.610
You have no other choice!

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.080
Before you become one of them, go forth and pile up more bodies!

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:49.540
Yes.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.750
What is the point of regretting anything?

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.670
What is the use of repenting my sins?

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.300
What can I possibly say to those who have died?

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.560
I cannot apologize to them now.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.470
This is...

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.890
...the path that I have chosen.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:15.610
If I regret my actions or seek atonement, then it's all over.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.650
And I will never reach my destined goal...

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.620
Yes.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.120
That is who you are.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.790
An illusion?

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.750
Not an illusion.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.750
It is the reality in your consciousness.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.880
Reaching for the castle in the heavens...

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.720
Stacking bodies to reach the highest summit is your destiny.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.090
Stepping on thousands of your comrades' bodies...

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.680
...and tens of thousands of bodies your comrades paved for you in turn.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:52.810
All while disregarding who or what they were, you trampled your way here!

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.730
You carried only one thought in your mind.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.570
And now you have reached the end of the path.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.820
Look around...

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.450
This is your gift, here at the final destination of your bloody journey.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.410
All of the hawk wings that have accompanied you in flight...

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.210
Each pair of wings...

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.920
Surely they will forgive you...

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.050
Even if they are racked by despair at this moment...

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.180
They will welcome you with open arms...

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.010
And you shall live on...

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.930
Entrust your wounded body to them...

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.190
Leave your past behind...

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.020
And bury yourself in the ruins of your dreams.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.400
The ruins...

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.070
...of my dreams...

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.620
That is the divine punishment created by man.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.660
But if your dream is still alive...

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.670
If that castle still dazzles you more than anything else in this world...

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.630
You must stack the remaining stones that surround you...

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.010
Let us chant...

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.760
This we offer.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.140
Hesitation will not let the black wings fly from mountain top to the heavens.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.270
Fate is beyond human understanding...

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.060
If the laws of causality dictate that man is only to be toyed with...

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.150
...then his child must confront his destiny by embracing evil.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.530
Griffith!

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:36.790
Yes...

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.750
Out of all the thousands of comrades and tens of thousands of enemies.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.550
Only one...

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.510
You and you alone...

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.600
You made me forget my dream.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.610
I offer them all...

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.780
Griffith!

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.830
The threads of causality are now bound together...

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.410
The promised hour is now here!

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.750
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.390
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.430
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.400
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.660
What is that?

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.930
It's just the same.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.100
What is trying your crown?

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.280
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:29.610
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.320
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.990
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.190
