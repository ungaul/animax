00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.880
Orders to return?

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.260
Why, on such short notice, Abbot?

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.880
It is a direct order from the Holy See.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.350
It can be said that the heretics 
have been sufficiently quelled.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.990
I thank you for your long service.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.320
Remnants may yet be hiding.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.670
The people are still unsettled.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.900
The investigations and sentencing 
will take time to conclude.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.980
In the meantime, what will you 
do to maintain security?

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.740
You needn't worry yourself about that.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.470
This directive was not addressed 
to the Holy Iron Chain Knights.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.260
But to you alone, Lady Farnese.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.600
What?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.910
I am to abandon my own troops?

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.020
I, the commander, should abandon our mission?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.140
I do not understand.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.270
I cannot accept!

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.430
As for your current mission,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.910
having Vice-Commander Azan lead in 
your stead should not be a problem.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.950
Lady Farnese, it appears that 
this directive comes, in part,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.570
at the wish of Lord Vandimion, your father.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.270
I ask you to understand.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.080
Though this may be a holy mission,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.160
your father does not wish you,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.050
as a woman, to remain long 
in such a gruesome place.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.060
I...

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.310
House Vandimion funds the majority 
of relief supplies for these refugees.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.820
Lady Farnese!

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.320
Please wait, Lady Farnese...

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.450
Ow.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.450
You told my father, didn't you?

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.570
Eh?

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.090
I know it all!

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.250
You report to my family on my actions.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.880
You probably wrote that I am 
joyously hunting heretics

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.010
and burning them at the stake, right?

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.460
That's...

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.320
Was it at my father's order?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.850
You couldn't deny the master of the house.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.000
Well...

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.600
But do not forget.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.540
I am your master!

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.080
You swore your sword to me.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.140
I am your only master.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.740
Yes, my lady.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.360
Do you hate me?

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.000
Why would I?

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.000
I have never met anyone as pathetic as you.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.360
You blabbed everything before I 
could take a single fingernail.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.010
Sorry...

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.360
Having sold out your friend, 
enjoy your last night alive.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.490
Sorry... Sorry...

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.900
Please forgive me...

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.790
Blood Flow of the Dead

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.510
Well done, Lady Farnese.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.070
It would not be an exaggeration to say

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.690
that we have captured nearly 
all of the heretics at Albion.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.560
Your reputation as the Holy Iron Chain 
Knights' commander is well deserved.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.560
No, it is thanks to God's grace.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.110
By the way, your report indicates

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.150
that your men encountered several anomalies 
while raiding the heretics' lair.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.470
The cave was full of arcane drugs 
and incense that the heretics use

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.720
during their rituals.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.550
I believe they may have triggered 
a mass hallucination.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.040
According to the report,
there is one other thing.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.040
The Black Swordsman, previously sought 
by your knights, appeared?

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.010
Yes.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.090
Hmm, but why?

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.870
H-Hey, stop.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.850
This girl...

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.780
What about her?

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.810
Oh, it's nothing.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.200
It's just, when the Black
Swordsman appeared,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.500
he seemed to be trying to rescue her.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.470
Witch...

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.570
Please save us.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.110
Reporting, sir.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.870
The heretics' confessions indicate

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.870
that the girl is their priestess.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.240
Or, perhaps, the very object of their faith.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.000
The priestess of heretics, with ties 
to the Black Swordsman...

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.530
Hmm...

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.230
This is a witch's brand indeed.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.820
Evidently, we must take special 
care in investigating this girl.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.710
Casca!

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.980
Casca...

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.480
Let's go.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.200
You two, stay hidden.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.570
I know you want to hurry, but if 
you cause a commotion,

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.350
you'll lose your chance to rescue her.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.610
Huh? I haven't seen you around here.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.200
I got a personal summons.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.920
Sorry, but would you take a message?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.010
I'm here for Jerome, of the 
Holy Iron Chain Knights—

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.870
Huh? Did someone just pass?

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.910
I'm sure you imagined it...

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.700
Casca!

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.360
Wh-What is going on here?

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.480
That's...

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.580
Stay back, please!

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.160
Blood?

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.380
I hurt!

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.380
I'm starving...

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.380
I'm cold!

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.910
M-Monsters!

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.640
They eat humans.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.060
Don't leave us behind!

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.650
Please hurry, Lady Farnese!

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.650
W-Wait!

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.650
Father Mozgus!

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.650
Father Mozgus, we must retreat!

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.110
Impertinent witch!

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.470
The front entrance is blocked.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.410
Let's escape to the chapel.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.240
Casca!

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.280
N-No way...

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.740
What is going on here?!

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.360
For now, let us ascend!

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.260
I shall explain later!

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.690
Y-You—

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.690
Where is my companion?

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.200
Then you did come here for the girl.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.720
Answer me!

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.910
Th-That girl is in the cellar...

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.070
In the torture chamber...

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.210
The torture chamber.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.040
Where is that?

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.210
I-It's no use. Even if you go there now...

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.250
In the cellar, there are...

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.720
There are so many.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.930
Hey! Get your act together!

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.660
I don't know!

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.190
They shouldn't exist.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.340
They can't exist. Not those things...

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.120
Take me to that torture chamber of yours.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.210
No!

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.730
Who would go there again?

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.860
Sorry, but hurry it up...

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.030
I'm about to snap.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.810
I'm so useless...

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.650
I'm a worthless human being.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.790
Only one more night.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.770
Even now, I'm only worried about myself.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.890
Because of me, by now, Elaine must be...

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:30.920
But...

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.020
I don't want to die—

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.730
Retreat! Retreat!

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.580
Up! Run up!

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.930
What about the prisoners?

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.750
Who cares? Abandon them!

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.030
What's going on?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.780
U-Um, did...

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.420
Did something happen?

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:48.980
Monsters!

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.280
Monsters...

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.340
Hello?

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.560
It's coming from below?

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.180
Guards! Please open the door!

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.030
No!

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.010
Please, someone!

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.020
Found you...

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.690
Hey.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.460
Luca!

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.440
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.320
The emotional reunion will have to wait.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.570
Something is wrong.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.570
Hey, now! What are you doing?

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.600
Run!

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.610
That way!

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.800
It's the plan. It's a diversion.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.830
We'll use them as bait, and escape 
while they distract the guards.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.080
Hey, I may not look it, but I 
am a heretic hunter.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.150
You're saying that, even now?

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.840
You're an accomplice.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.910
Damned brat...

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.420
Sorry, Jerome.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.110
I didn't mean to involve you.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.590
Honestly, I've reached
the end of my rope.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.310
But I guess it's all good.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.880
I didn't like the mission, anyway.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.930
And this gives me a break.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.600
Ruining my future over a woman

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.730
may be fitting for a prodigal son like me.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.380
Jerome...

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.240
All right. With that decided, 
let's get out of Albion.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.990
Sorry, we have one more.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.480
Nina, where's Elaine?

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.750
I...

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.890
d-don't know.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.810
She's probably in the basement.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.510
Everyone's gone. This is your chance.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.880
What's that?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.850
What's going on here?

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:50.990
Impossible.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.790
Only a while ago...

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.130
That...

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.480
That thing did it!

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.060
Hey.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.940
What are you doing?

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.560
Trying to get heavy armor 
and run down the enemy.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.590
I sneaked in here to save Casca.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.070
But those things came out of 
the woodwork in the room.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.290
Where is...

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.520
Where is Casca?

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.320
Casca was swallowed up by them...

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.240
Oh, but something didn't make sense.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.760
Everyone else melted right away,

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.450
but Casca didn't.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.090
Even though she was swallowed, 
I could still sense her presence.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.610 line:20%
What is he doing?

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.260
I think she's okay.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.960
No, I'm sure of it!

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.710
Wh-What is that?

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.340
This way.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.170
That's right...

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.890
Back then...

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.270
Hey, you're free to go.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.040
W-Wait!

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.110
I'll come, too!

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.250
Please stay back!

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.000
The doors will give way soon!

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.510
There is nothing to fear!

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.270
This is our faith's moment of truth.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.000
We do not pray to God for salvation.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.410
Faith requires everything from us.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.780
Repent, evil spirits!

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:52.530
I have found that faith means death!

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.540
Come at me!

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.390
Master, draw back!

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:05.140
No matter what may challenge me...

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.500
Hey, mister!

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.310
I need to go downstairs!

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.350
Escaping is the priority!

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.360
Elaine, I hope you're safe...

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.580
Got it!

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.450
If I remember right, the chapel's ahead.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.180
Those doors are pretty thick.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.710
Ideal for holing up in—

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.500
Sh-Shit!

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.680
Luca!

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.680
Close your eyes!

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.490
Stones...

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.710
Stones!

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.730
I have witnessed a miracle!

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.820
This is God's will.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.190
I am to guide the people with this power.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.320
Elaine...

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.740
That's Elaine!

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.130
Hey, square-face!

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.740
Hand over that lady!

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.520
That will not do.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.540
This witch is the origin of the 
evil that festers in Albion.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.570
I am destined to demonstrate

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:32.010
God's victory to the people, by burning 
this witch at the stake.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.750
What witch are you talking about?

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.370
You guys look tons more suspicious!

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.010
Guess we have no choice...

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.290
I see.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.910
You seek to interfere with my sacred duty?

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:48.610
My disciples have no mercy 
toward enemies of God.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.660
Hey, those are above my pay grade!

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.920
Luca!

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.250
M-Mister, another attack!

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.510
The next one's coming!

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.930
It's fine! Pull them up, fast!

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:30.870
Here, this way.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.440
The presence is getting stronger.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.200
W-Wait...

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.710
Luca...

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.450
Nina...

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.730
So heavy.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.860
This is how heavy Luca is.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.340
I'm holding Luca's life in my hands.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.720
Right now, all that she is rests in my hands.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.800
If I were to let go...

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.220
Jerome, take care of Nina.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.980
Huh?

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.810
Hurry! Run!

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.350
Luca!

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.600
Luca...

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.850
Why?

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:15.950
Huh?

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:16.990
What's that?

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.000
Is it Death?

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.980
Wh-What was that?

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.610
I-It flew?

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.980
Luca...

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.530
I'd forgotten about them!

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.140
Get down!

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:09.780
Um, you're Death... Right?

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.170
Girl, why did you choose to die?

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.620
H-Hey, don't go there...

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.670
I'm not that noble.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.350
Look, that tower is really tall.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.550
But it has a couple layers, see?

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.680
I wouldn't have slammed into the ground.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.780
I thought I could maybe get 
away with a broken leg,

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.690
as long as the roofs were wooden...

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:36.230
Well, now that I think about it, 
it was pretty reckless.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.380
I thought it was the only choice, 
so everyone could live, but...

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.200
But I guess it didn't work, after all.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.940
I got lucky and was spared pain,

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.140
but this doesn't really feel like Heaven.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.600
It is not.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.320
This is a resting place for the dead, 
at the foot of that tower.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.210
Huh?

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.450
Oh, you mean I'm still alive?

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.090
So it seems.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.790
If you wish to stay so, do not move.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.780
Show yourself!

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.100
What?

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:18.190
So you are the famed Black Swordsman...

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.220
I do not know what you seek to accomplish,

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.980
but I cannot let you have this witch,

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.410
in the name of God's justice!

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.980
Fool, you seek to rebel against God!

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.050
I will have you atone with blood.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.460
An Apostle?

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.790
No, it's different.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.480
My brand senses something else.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.770
They'll be formidable foes.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.230
And seven of them, at that.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.750
Guts, behind you!

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.700
W-Wow!

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.460
It was only possible with my assist.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.450
Brat, you've got something 
strange on your head...

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.490
When did they...

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.720
I can't avoid it.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.970
What?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.540
Just one more step.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.590
Screams?

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.550
It begins...

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.560
Elven Lethal Head-Strike!

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.560
We desire only one thing.
