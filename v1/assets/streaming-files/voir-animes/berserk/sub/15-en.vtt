00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.370
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.540
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.320
At least it is true...

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.420
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.460
Guts... ...are you thinking of...

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.810
Are you going to leave the Band of the Hawk?

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.290
Feel no shame about shape.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.240
Weather changes their phrase.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.970
Even mother will show you another way.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.370
So put your glasses on.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.440
Nothing will be wrong.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.640
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.480
It's up to you.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.140
The first words should be found.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.750
Whatever holds you back.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.420
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.260
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.360
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.330
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.130
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.370
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.000
It's too late.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.880
The Decisive Battle

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.340
Message!

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.770
I have a report!

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.410
Our army has endured immense damage!

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.950
Only this headquarters remains intact!

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.980
How could this have happened?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.560
We White Tiger Knights have one of the strongest armies in all Midland...

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.690
...and we have been beaten so easily!

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.360
That castle of Doldrey is quite impregnable!

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.790
I have a report!

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.400
Now what?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.470
A thousand cavalrymen from the enemy fort's main gate!

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.210
They are charging our headquarters!

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.530
What?

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.680
The strongest of all Tudor's armies...

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.580
The Purple Rhino Knights?

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.940
This hundred-year war...

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.780
...was triggered by the Tudor Empire's invasion on Midland's territory.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.780
The castle of Doldrey once belonged...

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.420
...to our kingdom as an integral part of our defenses.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.860
Ironically, this fort has become a staging point...

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.730
...for attacks by the Tudor army ever since they captured it.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.820
However, civil war may break forth at any moment in the Tudor Empire...

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.940
...in regards to the matter of imperial succession.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.140
Most likely, the empire cannot...

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.530
...afford to spare all of its great military forces for this war.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.470
Indeed, this is a rare opportunity for us!

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.910
We can't miss this opportunity to achieve the conquest of Doldrey!

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.140
No, to recapture our fief!

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.480
Very well, what shall we do about it?

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.110
The principal garrison stationed there is the Purple Rhino Knights.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.750
They're led by fierce General Boscone and are the strongest knights...

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.260
...in the entire empire!

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.490
Even our most powerful asset...

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.000
...the White Tiger Knights, suffered great losses when engaging them.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.760
An all-out attack... That might be our only option.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.500
That is very risky!

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.770
You must consider the overall campaign...

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.440
...as we've already lost forty percent of our total fighting strength.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.940
There is no guarantee...

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.410
...that we will conquer Doldrey, even if we deploy all of our assets.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.000
If the battle is prolonged...

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.920
We will likely be caught between their main army and the occupation forces!

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.550
If we are rash, we'll risk the annihilation of our entire armed forces.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.390
I believe the war is overall in our favor, and eventually we shall be victorious.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.830
Therefore, such a dangerous gamble is not worth the risk.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.590
But our final objective in this war is to take control of Doldrey!

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.000
To recapture our fief, occupying Doldrey is essential!

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.870
However, which unit will be considered for the role of the vanguard?

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.500
Remember, we lost the White Tiger Knights.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.770
Well...

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.080
What would you say, Sir Griffith?

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.050
Even your invincible Band of the Hawk wouldn't be able to handle this, right?

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.850
We could, if given the order.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.620
I understand. It can't be helped... Hey...

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.330
If Your Majesty gives me the order... Nonsense!

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.730
Do you think you can really do it?

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.500
Your Lordship understands nothing about the difficulties!

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.670
He has gotten a rather swelled head...

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.040
...on account of his lucky victories in the past.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.970
I agree.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.980
During the past one hundred years, that castle has never been damaged...

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.280
...despite all of our many desperate attempts to capture it.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.980
However, you still say you can conquer it?

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.360
My Lord Griffith...

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.090
Can you truly do this?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.090
He is being reckless, Your Majesty!

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.760
The Doldrey conquest requires us to employ an enormous armed force!

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.700
If we fail at this time, it will cause great permanent damage to us...

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.440
I do not need to engage them with a large army.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.540
The Band of the Hawk alone will cope with this matter.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.710
What?
That's impossible!

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.740
Who do you think you are?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.450
Don't be ridiculous!

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.620
A mere force of five thousand men...

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.280
...against the enemy's occupation force of thirty thousand strong?

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.020
Don't get cocky, boy!

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.730
And don't think your cunning little schemes will succeed forever!

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.800
General...

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.830
There's no need to get up in arms over this.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.770
What?

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.170
Sooner or later, we will have to venture into total war.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.910
We are left with no other options in this matter.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.780
But having a single troop first carry out such a clever ploy...

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.390
...should not affect the overall leadership of this army.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.750
And considering the Band of the Hawk's past achievements...

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.550
...it's unfair to say that they will have no chance at all.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.490
Do not underestimate Doldrey!

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.160
Damn...

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.730
Your Majesty, please give us your final word.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.310
I command that the Band of the Hawk be committed to Doldrey's conquest.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.510
His Majesty has certainly aged.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.720
How could he rely upon a newcomer, a boy like him?

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.090
The army of Midland has lost all dignity.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.160
Well...

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.700
I can imagine how he feels, but there's nothing that can be done...

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.570
You have quite a high opinion of that man, don't you?

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:58.440
I wonder if the White Hawk will rise to the occasion, as you expect he will.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.880
Well, either way, I told them the truth.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.550
Even if he loses the battle...

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.210
No other man in Midland...

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.620
...is even capable of conquering Doldrey.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.290
Certainly.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.770
It may be strange for a man to say this...

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.080
...but he looks as if he just stepped out of a painting.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.280
A commander beyond all others...

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:42.750
Perhaps, we are fighting alongside the kind of hero...

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.730
...who only emerges once in a century.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.660
Doldrey, huh?

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.070
Whatever, it makes no difference to me.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.260
Anyone can win a war or dice game if it's meant to be!

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.370
There!

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.140
There you go!

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.510
Get outta here!

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.270
Winning ten times in a row?

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.910
The commander won everything again.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.250
You really have the devil's own luck, boss!

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:10.940
All right!

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.150
I won't give up until I get my money back!

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.890
What's wrong?

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.520
Is there something bothering you?

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.120
N-No...

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.320
Don't worry.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.060
We've been through this kind of thing before.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.970
If a self-respecting man like him offered to fight...

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.900
The odds must be in his favor.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.740
I hope he doesn't lose his composure...

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.440
Do you remember what I told you some time ago?

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.210
When we became involved in a territorial dispute in a certain region...

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.750
Griffith... I mean...

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.260
That nobleman you mentioned...

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.130
Shit, the commander won again?

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.530
Give me a break!

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.330
That nobleman was promoted to governor in a certain empire...

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.570
His bribe money spoke the loudest when the position was awarded.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.100
Hey, don't tell me he...

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:18.150
The governor of the empire of Tudor's northlands, Governor Gennon.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.820
That's the title he currently holds.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.800
Sir Adon, we are glad to see you safe.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.270
I, known far and wide as the invulnerable and resourceful Adon...

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.770
...would never die so easily!

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.370
Anyway, that boy...

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.140
If we meet on the battlefield again, I certainly won't let him get away!

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.810
For shame, Adon!

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.490
Your Grace, General Boscone!

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.720
To settle a personal grudge...

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.770
You deployed all those mercenaries, and all you achieved was total defeat!

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.460
Even worse than that, your brother Samson is dead!

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.610
You've got a lot of nerve coming back here alone...

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.230
...after such a disgrace!

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.810
No, uh...

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.880
I-It is not true, Your Grace... Truthfully...

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.050
This is outrageous!

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.430
From now on, I divest you of any authority to command in this war.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.410
You should appreciate the fact I'm not throwing you in the dungeons!

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.680
Your foe was reportedly only one soldier, the same man in the rumors...

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.620
That cannot be...

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.830
You were strict as usual.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.690
I could even hear you shouting from up here.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.330
Please excuse my harsh manner. It must be unpleasant to your ear.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.130
All right then.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.770
By the way, according to my spies...

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.940
...the second wave for the conquest of Doldrey has been chosen.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.150
You know them well by now... ...the Band of the Hawk.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.020
You look happy.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.750
No, I do not mean to...

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.690
But they seem to be much more difficult to deal with...

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.890
...than the other opponents, who rely only on numbers and reputation.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:51.100
Anyhow, I need to tell you something before you set off for battle.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.910
The Band of the Hawk's leader, Griffith the White Hawk...

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.270
You must not kill him.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.780
Keep him alive and bring him to me.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.020
But...

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.450
Keep in mind this is your governor's order.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.840
How are your wounds? Still hurts?

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.210
I'm fine now.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.780
Thanks to the medicine you gave me.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.190
Even so, the more I see that fortress, the less confident I feel.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.890
The castle walls are built twice as high and twice as thick than any other.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.900
The far side is protected by a sheer cliff...

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.940
And the Purple Rhinos are stationed there as well.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.170
No big deal. It's just like any other castle, only bigger.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.540
We'll just do what we always do.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.240
I hope so, anyway.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.080
Either way, I'm surprised.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.550
He burned all the boats.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.990
What on earth is the White Hawk thinking?

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.360
I wonder if his tactic is to position himself with his back to the river?

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.060
It doesn't matter.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.630
With their numbers, they can only stave off the inevitable for a moment.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.200
All we have to do is attack them head-on.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.100
However...

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.250
Does the governor happen to have some relation to him?

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.510
Well, it's a waste of time for me to worry about such absurdities!

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.020
My duty is only to tear my opponents apart until the end!

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.990
The White Hawk...

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.270
I have never imagined that I would see him alive again.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.840
I'll definitely have him.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.370
Look at all of this dust!

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.080
It's part of my plan.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.780
Are you all right?

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.090
Good.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.660
It's about time to move.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.870
I hope he doesn't lose his composure...

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.160
That will never happen.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.170
He's the last man to lose his calm...

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.480
This is the final time...

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.880
...I wield my sword under this flag...

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.150
First formation, advance!

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.830
But I'm not going to leave any loose ends behind me...

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.100
I'm going to take full responsibility as the leader of the Raiders!

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.600
Draw your swords!

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.680
First formation, charge!

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.670
The first formation contains...

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.250
...two thousand men directly under Griffith and his top companies' control!

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.680
What nonsense...

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.350
Dividing his army into two formations when he only has five thousand men?

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.390
I don't know what kind of cunning plan he's trying to hatch...

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.960
Very well, I'll accept your challenge!

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.690
All units, charge!

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.960
Grind the enemy's first formation into dust!

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.910
Are these their Raiders we've heard so many reports about?

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:51.880
Interesting!

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.860
One of the enemy's companies is bursting through our front line!

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.600
They're aiming to get at our army's leaders by breaking through head-on...

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.730
Is this the White Hawk's scheme?

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.110
Follow the commander!

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.480
This can't be!

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.920
Nothing has ever obstructed the Purple Rhino's assault before...

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.190
We can't move any further. In fact, we might even be repelled!

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.260
General!

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.990
That's him.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:49.030
Reportedly, he wiped out one hundred mercenaries all by himself...

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.230
It seems that report was not altogether false.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.070
Well, the White Hawk possesses good personnel.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.840
Remain steadfast!

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.170
They're just trying to disrupt our training!

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.470
Fall back into formation, then counterattack!

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.520
They put up a good fight against the Purple Rhino Knights...

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.290
But they will soon realize their limits.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:17.420
Damn you, Boscone! At this rate, you could end up killing Griffith!

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.170
Someone, attend to me!

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.460
Yes, sir!

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.540
Have my personal guard prepare to take the field.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.200
I will command directly from the battlefield!

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.680
However, what about defending the castle?

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.110
Pay no mind!

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.380
As things stand, the Band of the Hawk cannot...

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.950
...get any closer to the castle walls.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.090
Yes, sir!

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.290
My precious hawk is coming back to me...

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.230
I'm not going to let him be killed for nothing.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.660
It's time, Captain!

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.270
All companies, retreat!

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.470
Regroup at the base camp!

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.640
Come on, men, get moving!

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.580
The enemy is retreating!

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.980
Start the pursuit!

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.220
Strange!

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.690
They must have foreseen the consequences...

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.890
...since they chose this particular strategy.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.290
Did the invincible White Hawk really plot this scheme?

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.030
I'm not going to contradict you...

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.230
...but maybe you think too highly of those men, General?

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.300
Nevertheless, just give us the command to pursue them!

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.310
If we let them get away...

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.900
...the soldiers will be disgruntled because they'll have missed out...

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.670
...on their chance at glory!

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.950
What are you doing, Boscone?

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.320
Governor!

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.480
The enemy is retreating.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.990
Will you miss a chance for victory just to observe them?

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.860
No, but...

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.690
I order everyone!

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.760
Do not kill the enemy's leader, Count Griffith!

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.130
Capture him alive!

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.130
I promise that anyone who succeeds...

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.770
...in capturing him will be immediately promoted two ranks!

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.740
I will reward you with whatever you want!

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.750
Governor!

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.480
You should not promise such things.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.550
I care not!

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.910
But it affects military discipline!

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.680
Boscone!

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.880
From now on, I am taking direct command!

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.520
The Purple Rhino Knights are to immediately pursue the enemy!

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.930
Notify the entire army of my orders!

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.160
Make sure it is enforced!

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.500
General...

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.370
There's nothing we can do about this.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.130
All units, move to pursue the enemy!

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.140
As rear guard, there are far too many for me to take on alone...

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:53.650
But after everything, they are taking the bait, just as Griffith planned.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.160
Yeah, everything was executed so it would play perfectly into your hand...

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.520
As always...

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.660
What a thrilling view!

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.030
We're not going to deal with all of that, are we?

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.670
Formations, regroup!

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.040
We are reaching a crucial moment.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.950
Our backs are to the river!

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.210
There's no way to escape!

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.450
Lay down your lives!

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.360
If you don't, we are doomed!

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.860
If we can survive... ...then we'll have won!

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.720
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:07.360
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.400
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.370
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.630
What is that?

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.900
It's just the same.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.070
What is trying your crown?

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.250
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.580
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.290
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.960
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.190
Next Episode

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:14.300
When every battle means life or death, defeat is not an option.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.170
No matter how much pain and grief a man undergoes...

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.170
...he can never turn his back.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.630
To realize a dream means to shed blood.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:29.580
Could this also be the curse of having a youthful heart?

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.220
The Conqueror
