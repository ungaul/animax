00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.890
In this world...

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.970
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.670
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.550
At least it is true...

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.720
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.250
Certainly, thank you.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.960
Excuse me, let me pass, please.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.200
Raise your glass!

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.370
Please, make way...

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.610
Griffith...

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.340
Griffith!

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.120
Feel no shame about shape.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.070
Weather changes their phrase.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.800
Even mother will show you another way.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.200
So put your glasses on.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.270
Nothing will be wrong.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.470
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.310
It's up to you.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.970
The first words should be found.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.580
Whatever holds you back.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.250
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.090
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.190
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.160
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.960
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.200
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.830
It's too late.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.790
Tombstone of Flames

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.400
Griffith!

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.960
Griffith!

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.310
Sentry, close down the hall!

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.910
Don't allow anyone to leave here!

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.420
Griffith!

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.360
Griffith!

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.040
How easy can this be?

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.940
Just think, I'll be making a fortune off this ruse...

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.210
More than I could ever make even after ten years of honest toil!

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.280
All I have to do is leave town by dawn...

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.690
Who knew things would go so smoothly?

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.420
It's almost anticlimactic!

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.920
Indeed...

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.830
And we owe it all to Minister Foss, for plotting such a brilliant scheme!

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.230
Truly, your expertise is to be commended!

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.690
No, you're too kind.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.740
Well done, Minister Foss.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.440
It is very kind of Your Majesty.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.370
What's the matter?

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.310
You do not look well.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.880
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.100
It's because you're seeing me under candlelight.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.940
Anyway, are you really sure everything's going to be fine?

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.020
Because if that waiter is ever apprehended...

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.060
...and he ends up confessing...

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.360
Our names could very well be revealed!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.560
No need to worry about that, gentlemen.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.300
I just received word from the operative I sent in beforehand...

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.530
...that the matter has already been dealt with.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.470
Oh, there is no detail that escapes your guile!

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.980
Really, you are quite the strategist!

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.340
Your talents are being wasted as a mere minister!

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.550
Now then, if you would allow me to go check on the state of the uproar...

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.530
At last, dignity will be restored to the army of Midland.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.370
That is certain.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.430
It is ridiculous that a mere mercenary could become White Hawk General!

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.480
His example would have put all kinds of ideas...

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.210
...into the heads of common soldiers.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.950
We of noble blood, and no one else, should be...

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.920
...the ones to assume the pivotal roles in our kingdom's administration.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.360
How could that man of lowly birth presume to...

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.160
Inferior subjects have no idea how to govern the kingdom!

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.320
Every other county would have considered us a laughingstock!

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.140
In any case, you have all toiled for our common goal.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.770
I must thank you.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.310
We are unworthy...

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.740
Without your support, Your Highness, none of this would have come to pass!

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.270
Now we have ensured the preservation of the noble bloodline.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.640
W-What?

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.970
Is that smoke?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.070
It can't be!

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.910
Open the door!

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.480
What's wrong?

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.020
I-It's locked!

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.990
What?

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.220
Step back from the door!

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.430
F-Fire!

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.270
What is this?

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.680
What is this all about?

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.500
G-Griffith!

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.970
Why?

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.440
The doctor confirmed that you had perished!

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.280
Certainly, it appeared that way to you.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.980
Because I arranged things to that end.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:57.880
What?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.220
It was not poison that you saw me drink.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.730
It was a secret potion with henbane, which induced a brief comatose state.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.970
Of course, an overdose would have killed me...

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.560
But it was well worth risking my life...

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.540
...since I was able to trap you all in one fell swoop!

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.680
H-Help me!

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.210
I just happened to be summoned by the queen and Minister Foss!

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.720
I had nothing to do with it!

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.520
Hold your tongue, you fool!

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.550
I suppose you are all...

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.850
...too used to sitting at your desks, thinking up your little plots.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.050
This is a war.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.020
There are no grandstands on the battlefield.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.600
You swine, Griffith!

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.830
Do you intend to kill me?

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.200
Do you think that a man...

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.940
...of lowly origins like you can burn me, the queen of the Midland, to death?

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.710
I won't allow it!

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.650
I do not admit defeat!

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.980
On the battlefield, one does not die royalty, a nobleman...

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.520
...or a commoner.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.390
You die as the loser of the battle.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.310
It's all over...

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:30.840
What's the matter with you?

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.580
A man of your stature.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.250
Surely this is not an uncommon thing to occur within the court.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.590
Are you afraid?

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.920
Because you betrayed your own comrades?

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.190
Or perhaps... because you lent a hand in murdering the queen?

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.260
I'd like to ask you one thing...

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.030
How did Your Lordship know about our plot?

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.970
I didn't know about it.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.310
But then... why did you approach me?

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.980
I predicted you were going to become my enemy on that morning...

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.350
...before I was last sent to the battlefield.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.920
That was when...

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.070
You saw my eyes...

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:36.040
And I knew that you would no longer tolerate my existence in the court.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.910
H-How did you...

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.220
Because in that moment, I could see that your eyes were clouded with fear.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.130
When one is confronted by something he finds to be truly frightening...

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.890
...he realizes that it is impossible to ignore it.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.700
In such a situation, he has one of two choices...

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.360
Either to submit to its control, thereby ensuring his own protection...

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.870
...or to annihilate it, thus eliminating the terror he harbors.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:09.180
I was aware certain people in the court were offended by my presence.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.150
I just couldn't pinpoint who they were.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.250
But I knew how shrewd of a man you are.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.320
I was certain you'd rally the others and convince them to eliminate me.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.090
However, I never imagined the queen would join the intrigue...

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.160
This is unbelievable!

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.030
His eyes just met mine for a moment!

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.470
Have I been dancing to his tune ever since then?

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.740
Now I know why I can't stop myself from trembling.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.610
Not because I betrayed my comrades or took part in the queen's murder.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.920
It's because of this man...

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.420
It's because I am terrified of this man!

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.790
This contract sealed with your blood... We can do away with it now, no?

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.430
There should be no ill will between us if we are to have a successful future.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.270
Hopefully, there will only be peace and friendship, wouldn't you agree?

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.810
Now, come along, Minister...

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.110
It is time for me to return something to you, as promised.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.750
Elise!

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.220
Father!

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.690
Thank goodness you're all right! You're safe now!

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.520
Father!

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.230
Enjoying the poignant reunion scene, sir?

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.490
Well, abducting her was no small task.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.400
We checked that kid's entire lesson plan a week beforehand...

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.670
And snatched her as she set off in a carriage.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.040
We treated her courteously while she was in our care, as you wished.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:52.940
You did a good job.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.440
Here is the rest of your reward...

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.210
Oh, great!

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.190
Anytime you need something, just let us know.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.720
From now on, we only desire a good relationship with you, sir.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.960
Well, we are off.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.200
What a cinch!

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.780
I've never had such an easy job. I want to work for him again!

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.950
No problem... If he ever decides to cut our connection, we'll blackmail him...

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.540
...with the dirt we have!

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.320
Who is it?

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.460
Who the hell are you?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.560
It seems to be finished...

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:58.600
Yeah...

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.480
...it's taken care of.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:01.520
Everything.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.610
Still, who knew these men would lose their lives for a handful of coins?

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.620
Leave the money on them as it was.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.660
They earned it, after all. That's their rightful share.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.290
They did the amount of work they were paid for.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.340
Money opens all doors... ...I see.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.300
But is it safe to let that man go?

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.840
He must have learned his lesson after today's events...

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.470
Maybe... Hey... Maybe?

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.430
If something happens, I'll take care of it when the time comes.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.230
Still, you can bet there's going to be another huge uproar over this.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.020
So many dead bodies piling up, now even the queen's. All in just one night.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.320
But no one would imagine that the man who was supposed to die...

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.950
...was the one pulling the strings.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.780
Tell me, do you find me vile?

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.750
I made you an accomplice in such a dastardly plot...

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.620
...while never getting my own hands dirty.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.380
I left all of the dangerous and difficult tasks to you alone...

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.920
So tell me, do you think I am a vile man?

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.560
You're asking someone who's slaughtered a hundred men.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.060
Kind of late to be wondering, don't you think?

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.190
You're just following this path so you can realize your dream, right?

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.360
You believe that, don't you?

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.860
So what's all this you're talking about now?

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.860
You're right... Now, let's go back!

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.700
A dead man like you shouldn't hang around here all night.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.410
You've got to keep Casca and the others from worrying too much.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.370
Yeah...

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:46.170
You didn't notice since you were dead, but Casca wore a dress for the party.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.750
Really?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.170
And it was definitely a sight worth seeing!

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:05.520
Gri...

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.810
...ffith...

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.570
Griffith!

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.660
Griffith!

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.950
Are you all right?

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.040
Griffith, Griffith...

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.630
I'm sorry I distressed you, Casca.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.800
We had no idea what was going to happen!

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.550
Ever since you collapsed, Casca's been in a state of shock...

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.100
I am sorry.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.230
You look pretty in that dress.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.030
Just as the Tudor Empire conceded to an armistice signing...

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.780
Who on earth did this?

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.490
Perhaps someone who is plotting against the armistice signing.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.080
It must be reactionaries from Tudor!

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.120
Otherwise, there is the possibility of an assassin sent by a third country.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.750
How foolish they are...

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:51.040
It is quite unforgivable to disturb our long-awaited peace...

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.970
Snow...

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.480
Guts...

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.240
And you wouldn't believe the way that woman was acting!

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.910
Casca, where are you going this late?

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.870
Why is she in such a rush?

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.330
She's running to the bathroom, I bet. It's such a cold night...

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.840
Guts!

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.060
Guts...

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.440
You're...

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.770
Are you leaving?

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.360
Are you?

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.530
Wait a minute.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.660
You and I have our differences, but...

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.490
We've hovered between life and death together, remember?

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.370
All our hard work as the Band of the Hawk is just starting to bear fruit now.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.870
This is just the beginning for us, don't you see?

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:18.960
So how can you...

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.300
I've already decided.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.840
But...

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.880
I don't...

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.310
I don't want to live like this, buried in his dream...

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.690
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.330
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.370
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.340
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.600
What is that?

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.870
It's just the same.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.040
What is trying your crown?

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.220
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.550
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:36.530
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.260
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.930
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.740
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.440
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.190
Next Episode

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.550
Separation.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.630
It is unavoidable for anyone who decides to follow his own path.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:19.430
Invaluable friends and countless dreams...

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:25.270
When one forsakes everything, will it bring happiness or sorrow?

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.820
The wheels of causality are now truly beginning to turn.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.220
Separation
