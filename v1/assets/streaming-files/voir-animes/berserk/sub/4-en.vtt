00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.480
What is this?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.490
Stop...

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.910
Stop!

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
Stop!

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.000
Not again...

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.640
Da...

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.200
Danger...

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.180
You...

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.270
What the hell?

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.730
Danger... Hurry.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.250
There will be a pillar of fire where blind sheep gather

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.990
on holy ground.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.260
The hour of Heaven's fall...

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.030
Hurry.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.490
Go now...

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.260
Danger?

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.960
Wait, has something happened to Casca?

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.470
Epiphany

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.830
Snow, snow, flurry, flurry, spirits of winter!

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.110
Drifting from the sky, spirits of winter!

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.130
Dancing as they fall, like puffs of down!

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.550
Try to catch them... How mysterious—

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.600
Spirits of winter... Yay!

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.880
I caught something amazing!

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.060
Rickert!

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.970
I found a goblin—

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.100
Hey.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.610
You've grown a bit, huh?

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.210
Rickert!

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.400
Welcome back, Erica.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.540
Good work.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.900
You've bulked up a bit.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.000
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.120
Guts, you're alive?!

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.420
It's been two years!

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.960
Where and what were you—

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.670
Sorry, Rickert, but first,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.550
is she... Is Casca okay?

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.970
What's wrong?

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.370
Casca's...

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.850
Casca's gone.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.090
Wh-What happened, Rickert?

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.900
Guts!

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.420
Why? Since when?

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.750
Where'd she go?!

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.220
It's all my fault!

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.390
It's my fault!

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.540
Because I took her with me to find nuts!

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.600
It happened about a month ago.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.090
We had no choice.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.670
After so long in the mine shafts, Casca was in pretty bad shape.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.210
She was barely eating.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.340
Erica felt sorry for her, so...

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.280
Before I realized anything was wrong, she was gone...

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.890
Rickert, then why are you still here?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.230
Why aren't you out looking for Casca?!

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.100
You know what state she's in!

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.720
You idiot!

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.270
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.200
What's with you?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.750
You're the one who abandoned her and were gone for two years!

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.840
You have no idea what Rickert went through!

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.780
He did go look for her a million times...

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.340
He could've just left.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.120
But Rickert... He came back.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.470
He still came back here...

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.210
There's a reason I can't go.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.640
Shut up... I can't sleep.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.040
Godo...

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.310
Is it a disease?

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.200
Nothing so fancy.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.310
It's old age. Just old age.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.380
I don't feel like listening to your prattle.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.810
Show me your sword and false hand.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.930
Chips in the edge, blood, rust, warp...

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.880
Looks like you've been swinging this nonstop,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.790
barely stopping for food or rest.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.170
To survive, you can't afford sanity.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.710
That's the kind of fighting you've been doing?

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.050
Two years ago,

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.720
when Rickert showed up at my door, all of you grievously injured...

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.890
I still don't know what happened to you.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.420
Given the monster that came after you,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.740
I'm sure it was something abhorrent.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.770
But vengeance and repaying blood debts?

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.260
Don't you think you're running away to battle?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.990
To your hatred?

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:36.780
Hatred is where you turn when you can't face your grief.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.960
Vengeance is like sharpening a blood-stained,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.880
rusty sword in a pool of blood.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.290
The more you sharpen it, the more rust builds up, so you sharpen it again.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:51.890
Ultimately, all that remains is a shattered pile of powdered rust.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.020
You don't understand.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.780
You can't understand.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.640
Not here, where it's nice and cozy.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.430
Not when you're about to kick the bucket,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.570
acting like you have no unfinished business.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.780
No one, no human being, can understand what happened.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.730
They all died.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.040
Every single one of them.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.890
Without reason.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.750
Without warning...

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.510
Without justice.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.790
They died like vermin!

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.840
They died ignorant...

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.720
In that instant,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.250
those who were irreplaceable to me...

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.320
To leave by yourself,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.230
you cast aside those irreplaceable people.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.540
Two years ago,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.060
you went alone, leaving the remaining irreplaceable people,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.740
broken after unimaginable suffering.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.420
You fled to be alone,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.780
to use your personal hatred to burn your very self.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.130
Am I wrong?

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.170
You abandoned that girl.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.570
Do you have the right to speak of vengeance for your fallen?

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.540
When it really matters,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.760
you lean on war for your actions.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.980
You're an unsheathed sword, whose blade has countless nicks.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.110
It glistens with blood, encroached by rust.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.540
A half-broken blade, with a lethal crack...

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.160
Hurry!

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.430
This way!

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.970
See? Over there!

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.430
What are they?

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.290
Graves.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.600
It just gives me peace of mind.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.600
I forge the swords to serve as their grave markers.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.960
It isn't as if anyone actually rests under them.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.050
There aren't nearly enough for all of them,

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.670
but we often did this on the battlefield, right?

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.650
Two years...

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.250
More than enough time for someone to change.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.470
While I remained mired in hatred, Rickert did this.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.120
He accepted their deaths.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.440
He mourned and found a new way of life.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.300
It's just like him, this vigorous strength.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.690
I know I'm safe here,

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.480
but without my sword, I can't sleep in the dark.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.980
No...

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.830
I probably can't ever sleep at night for the rest of my life.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.550
You fled to be alone,

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.970
to use your personal hatred to burn your very self.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.110
I didn't run away... I can't get away!

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.080
It's burned into my right eye,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.500
that final terror and hatred.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.270
I can never atone for this pitch black flame!

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.240
If I can't atone, and I can't run from it,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.790
I must let it burn me.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.120
I must let it engulf my enemies.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.880
Keep bathing in blood,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.740
killing, and thirsting.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.640
Forever alone.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.390
Forever...

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.400
That's right.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.750
I... I left her in that state.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.280
What right do I have now?

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.180
I abandoned Casca, who was the Band of the Hawk itself.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.380
I have no right to speak of vengeance for the fallen.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.240
You were captain of the raiding party, weren't you?

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.840
You said something about dreams or whatever,

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.250
but you left for selfish reasons, didn't you?

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.130
You weren't there in our hour of greatest need.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.170
How can I call someone like that a brother-in-arms?

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.510
You've left us, haven't you?

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.960
You have no obligation to go that far for us.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.660
Take her with you, even if by force.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.010
This time, you have to.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.500
If you don't, she'll...

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.650
You'll fight your own war, won't you?

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.150
You have to go.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.810
You have to go, even if you go alone.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.590
That's right.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.140
I left long ago.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.440
At that moment, I lost the right...

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.630
I guess I started that war.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.260
It's true that it wasn't what I wanted.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.280
But at least it wasn't anything that was forced on me.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.170
It's a war I chose to take on myself.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.000
But...

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:41.820
Even still...

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.950
Those camp fires back then...

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.810
They continue burning in my heart.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.070
That's right.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.500
Is this fragile, residual fire

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.330
the only thing keeping that black flame from engulfing me?

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.350
Man...

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.440
Have I made

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.500
the same mistake again?

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.810
Hurry.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.090
Go now...

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.550
No, not yet.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.590
It's not too late, yet.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.850
This time for sure...

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.070
I can't lose her ever again!

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.820
You're working hard!

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.200
H-Hey... I thought you were asleep.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.510
Well, yeah, but I'll just get eaten if I stay asleep.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.200
Oh.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.640
Okay, I'll help, too!

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.940
As a power-up, let's add a drill and a cutter on his false hand!

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.010
Well, that's...

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.780
Not a shoemaker's elf, but a blacksmith's, I see.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.650
Master, why are you dressed like that?!

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.150
There's something I have to do.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.600
D-Don't be reckless! I'll do it—

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.340
Shut up!

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.070
Take care of Erica for me.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:27.940
Master... She isn't my real daughter.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.210
She was an orphan, who lost her family in the war.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.520
I only knew how to deal with iron.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.890
But she made me into a pretty decent human being.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.190
But you know...

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:44.970
When you die, it's good to plunge into it alone.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.470
Master...

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.420
Tell that idiot not to turn into me.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.920
How's the new armor?

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.130
The master readied it for you.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.090
Also, there's a new weapon that uses gunpowder.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.020
And a new, improved bowgun that doesn't require assembly

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.840
when you need it in a pinch.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.050
Where are you off to now?

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.650
Have you heard of anywhere nearby known as "holy ground"?

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.430
Holy ground, huh...

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.380
Now that I think of it, an old monastery

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.460
named St. Albion is three days northeast of here.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.350
It's called the Tower of Conviction.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.700
The Tower of Conviction... It's full of refugees.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.000
Supposedly, heretics hid among them.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.860
So now, the Holy See is sending a grand inquisitor.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.860
Basically, there'll be a witch trial...

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.430
But why are you asking?

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:55.780
Guts!

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.510
I think the possibility that Casca's there is low.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.670
I have my reasons.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.590
I'm grasping at straws,

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.250
but I have to trust my instincts.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.270
Later.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.470
I don't really get what's going on.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.720
But I wonder what Casca's like.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.060
Guts!

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.670
I'm counting on you to help Casca!

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.980
Promise me you'll come back.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.920
Godo, you're a good smith!

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.610
I'll ask for help again when I return.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.150
You and your big mouth, idiot.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.360
Dad, you have to stay in bed!

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.740
I don't think we'll see each other again.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.340
It's better than getting all weepy, for sure.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.110
But when you're running toward a goal like that,

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.560
you'll let something pass by, unnoticed, again.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.590
Whether you live or die, you never get your way.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.210
It's like a mass migration.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.750
Disease and famine.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.350
And now, Kushan's massive invasion...

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.700
In its time of weakness after the king's death,

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.000
Windham, the capital, was attacked and occupied.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.390
Most of the retainers are missing, including the royal heir,

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.060
Her Highness Charlotte.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.550
When it rains, it pours... Show some respect.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:28.200
But if that's true, our destination, St. Albion,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.320
is near the Midland border,

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.190
despite being within Holy See jurisdiction.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.870
Kushans are considered our foes by religion, aren't they?

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.030
Is this the right time for an inquisition?

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.900
If anything were amiss, the Holy See would send new orders to us.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.110
Until then, we only need carry out the one we were given.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.970
Yes, my lady.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.500
Lady Farnese is in a worse mood than usual.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.180
Is something wrong?

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.910
I-It's nothing!

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.650
Don't think about it.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.910
It couldn't have been real!

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.960
I couldn't possibly do that.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.470
It must have been a hallucination, a nightmare.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.160
Right now, focus on escorting the grand inquisitor!

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.540
Even if God never graces me with a miracle,

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.240
I need but pursue my faith!

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.530
God is too far removed from the likes of you.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.700
No!

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.690
I...

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.190
Is it just a bad mood?

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.570
Those monsters... I didn't imagine them.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.940
It pains me to say it,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.080
but the Black Swordsman is too heavy a burden for Lady Farnese.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.020
Not only was she relieved of her role in the Black Swordsman's pursuit

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.670
after being blamed for his escape,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.680
but the new mission is to escort that man?

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.960
Of course she's in low spirits... Clear the way!

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.890
Watch out!

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.230
That's a giant carriage!

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.020
Shit! Who do they think they are?

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.700
Shh! Know your place!

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.970
That's the grand inquisitor's carriage.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.870
Look at the red wheels, hoisted on high!

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.490
They're practically the banners of Mozgus of the Bloody Bible.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.930
There's no mistake.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.920
The Mozgus?

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.290
The breaking wheel...

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.490
The skewering, water torture, burning at the stake...

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.460
He's easily sentenced over five hundred people to execution.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.410
An exponential number more are said to have died by torture.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.620
He's hated by many...

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.960
An enemy attack?!

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.240
Die, Mozgus!

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.270
You killed my family!

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.970
My son!
My daughter!

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.740
I'll kill you!

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.990
We can't reach him through the refugees!

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.470
They've flanked us!

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.960
Show yourself, Mozgus!

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.510
Huh?
What?

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:08.700
What the... Honestly, such a clamor...

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.880
God values silence.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.710
Lord Mozgus, are you all right?

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:16.880
I apologize!

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.610
We were taken completely by surprise!

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.390
Lady Farnese, please rise.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.390
God is generous to those who do His work.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:29.520
It is fortunate that no one who serves the Holy See has been injured.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.830
That is due to God's grace.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.020
I am humbled by your words.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.900
I shall be diligent in my efforts from here.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.880
And who may these men be?

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.980
They are torturers, working only for me.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.340
After rigorous training and service, they possess iron resolve.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.160
They are always of great service to our work.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.560
That is... very heartening to hear.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.400
So, pray tell, why did you attack me?

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.380
Shit!

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:56.940
Let me go!

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:58.420
It was for revenge!

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.820
You burned the village, killing everyone!

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.240
You claimed it was a sanctuary for heretics!

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.180
I merely meted out impartial judgment, in accordance with God's teachings—

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.370
How can you call it impartial?!

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.920
We only said we had to temporarily suspend our tithes

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.190
because famine had exhausted our food stores!

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.440
But you ignored what we said!

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.390
Divine punishment... You will face divine punishment!

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:20.970
Divine punishment...

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.670
Divine punishment?

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.200
How dare you speak of divine punishment,

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.330
you reprobate?!

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.080
You are an apostate, who dares turn on a cleric!

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.040
And you speak of divine punishment, you depraved lot?

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.720
Nay, none other than our Holy See

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.540
has the right to speak for God in this world!

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.600
Lady Farnese... Y-Yes?

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.350
What would you deem appropriate punishment for ones such as they?

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.120
Those who plan to murder a man of the cloth are typically condemned

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.990
to execution by fire or the breaking wheel.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.860
You are most wise, Commander of the Holy Iron Chain Knights.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.090
That is most perceptive.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.730
Then let us conduct a simplified trial here.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.370
Here is my judgment.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.850
All the accused are condemned to the breaking wheel.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.920
Forgive me!

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.420
Please! No!

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:30.640
N-Next.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.860
Next!

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:45.990
Hey!

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.050
Help me!

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.240
Hey... Don't involve yourself.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:54.000
Hey, girl!

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.100
Are you one of them?

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.250
Wait! She isn't with them at all!

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.210
Shut up!

00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.250
Come with us, too—

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:04.360
Wh-What, is she addled?

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.360
Hey, come!

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.510
Mercy!

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.780
No!

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.290
My name is Luca.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.460
Are you okay?

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.180
What a gruesome spectacle.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.920
I feel nauseated.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.670
If you watch, you'll just be sickened.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.740
Come.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.420
What an unexpected test of my blade.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.510
I'm not a fan of being mocked.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.470
I'm... I'm scared of everything!

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.470
The Kushans have no mercy, even for kids.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.480
Heretics.
