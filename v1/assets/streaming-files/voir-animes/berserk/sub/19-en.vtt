00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.440
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.270
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.210
At least it is true...

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.250
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.250
I don't want to live like this, buried in his dream...

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.860
You and Griffith...

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.730
I hope it works out between you and Griffith.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.210
Hey.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.070
Judeau, Corkus...

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.050
Come on, we need to talk.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.930
Griffith!

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.330
He would be able to stop him!

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.120
Feel no shame about shape.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.070
Weather changes their phrase.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.800
Even mother will show you another way.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.200
So put your glasses on.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.270
Nothing will be wrong.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.470
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.310
It's up to you.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.970
The first words should be found.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.580
Whatever holds you back.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.250
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.090
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.190
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.160
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.960
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.200
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.830
It's too late.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.830
Separation

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.420
What is this all of a sudden?

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.920
Sweetheart... It's not sudden.
Come here, girl!

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.860
I've been thinking about this since before we set off for our last battle.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.330
Hey darling, when do you...
Are you discontent about something?

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.420
Of course I'm not... ...get off work?

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.420
Not at all.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.500
But... Why don't you spend...

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.500
During these past three years...

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.820
...some time with me later?
...I've really enjoyed myself.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.970
It's been like one great party.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.100
I don't know... How could I be discontent?

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.040
Oh, I didn't ask your name yet... Then why do you...

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.570
Corkus, come on.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.300
Shut up!

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.510
I am Sir Corkus, commander of one of our companies!

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.720
What's wrong with me going to a bar and hitting on a girl or two?

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.890
We've got free rein in any pub in Windham...

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.320
...once they recognize us as Band of the Hawk commanders!

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.650
In the street, we're mobbed by kids and women as we walk by!

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.460
Of course!

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.100
We are the heroes who saved this kingdom!

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.170
Soon, we'll be admitted into society as nobles!

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.630
We'll be able to settle down in the court!

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.100
With luck, we could become lords of our own castles!

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.480
All of this would be impossible under ordinary circumstances!

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.480
Right?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.060
But we finally got our hands on it!

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.480
And it took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears too!

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.610
And now you say you're ready to throw it all away...

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.740
In any case...

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.200
Since killing people is your only talent...

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.790
...dancing at parties with the ladies is probably beyond you!

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.330
What you say is true.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.210
I can't do anything but wield a sword.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.560
The first time I killed a man, I was just a kid without a clue in the world.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.690
I've never known anything but the battlefield.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.400
I never tried to know more.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.360
Killing others to survive... That's all I've ever done.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.360
But...

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.780
I could have been content living that way...

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.410
If just one person...

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.030
Never mind who...

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.740
If only someone had ever cared about me...

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.870
But...

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.880
After wandering from one battlefield to another, it finally hit me...

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.170
When it's kill or be killed, it doesn't mean shit if someone cares or not.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.260
Yearning for that is just childish.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.300
Even so...

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.930
I ended up meeting him...

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.390
The one person I desperately wanted to notice me.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.730
He had nothing whatsoever in his possession.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.990
And he was driven to obtain everything.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.280
But because he aspires to such great heights...

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.700
...his skills always have to be honed to perfection.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.380
And so he can't afford to surround himself with the weak.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.760
But the funny thing is the more I see him in that light...

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.220
...the more dazzling he seems to me.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.270
I've had enough of it. Being part of his dream, always looking up at him.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.110
I want to achieve a goal of my own, so that I can call myself his equal.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.070
He's the one man I can't have looking down on me.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.200
Call yourself Griffith's equal, huh?

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.370
Cut the crap!

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.250
That's what you call childish bullshit!

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.210
He's special, don't you see?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.870
He's not like the rest of us!

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.420
You have no talent but slaying people...

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.590
Yet here you are, way out of your class, as our raider commander...

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.170
And you have no one to thank for that but Griffith!

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.010
I have no interest in rank or position.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.680
It's something else that I'm after...

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.930
Something I have to claim with my own hands.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.020
That's what I mean by childish drivel!

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.270
Something you have to claim with your own hands?

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.020
Life would be a lot easier if we could all find such a thing!

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.030
Listen!

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.530
We all have to make compromises in life, depending on our limitations...

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.780
...and the cards that we're dealt in this world!

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.080
People who think that all they need is a dream...

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.830
You guys make me sick!

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.710
That's nothing but an excuse for cowards who can't face reality!

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.880
Corkus...

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.630
What about you?

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.880
Isn't there something you want to claim too?

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.840
Gimme a break!

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.510
I need to get some sleep!

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.560
I can't tolerate this immature fool any longer!

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.360
That Corkus... He may not look it, but he was once a band of thieves' leader.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.240
I suppose at one point, he did have something that he wanted to claim...

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.280
...with his own hands, like you.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.450
As for myself...

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.040
I've always been proficient at anything I set my mind to.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.300
My quick wit and skills with a knife have always been superior to most.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.510
But I could never be the best at any one thing.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.060
That's why I decided... If I couldn't be the best...

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.100
...then I would serve under someone who could.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.350
I think everyone has the desire to attain something...

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.320
I'll see you out...

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.530
I hope you find it... That something you're after...

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.540
Hey, Guts... Yeah?

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.210
Why don't you ask Casca to go with you?

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:04.920
What?

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.710
What are you talking about?

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.300
As if it wasn't obvious enough already. Griffith's the one she...

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.260
I don't think Casca can ever be with Griffith.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.260
Why?

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.970
Because there's only one thing that Griffith is after...

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.390
And winning Princess Charlotte's hand is the fastest shortcut to it.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.770
And it's the only way he can ever hope to.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.150
Anyway, what do you think of Casca?

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.410
Sure, I think Casca's attractive.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.830
There aren't a lot of women you can trust your back to on the battlefield.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.540
But I don't really see Casca as a woman...

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.750
She's more like my comrade-in-arms.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.540
Well, then...

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:54.760
No...

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.970
...you're wrong.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.970
She only has eyes for Griffith.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.810
So for now, I can't be the one for her.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.270
I see.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.780
I guess I was the only one who thought there was some hope for you.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.490
Thanks for coming along. I'll be off now...

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.580
Guts!

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.830
You...

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.800
You're so mean. How could you leave without saying anything?

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.220
Why? Are you tired of the Band of the Hawk?

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.380
Rickert...

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.730
Are you leaving?

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.900
Yeah...

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.030
Are you resigning from the Band of the Hawk?

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.360
Sorry...

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.700
You're sorry? That doesn't explain anything!

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.200
You've got to tell us why!

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.540
The Band of the Hawk is like your own family! Isn't that true?

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.450
Stop it, Rickert.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.250
Why... It's a man's decision.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.250
We should just let him go.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.340
But Guts is the commander of the Raiders!

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.380
He's crucial to the Band of the Hawk!

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.340
We were already invincible before he joined.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.050
But... Shut up!

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.930
Hey, I'm going to tell you this now!

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.350
I've always hated you!

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.520
I'll never acknowledge your skills!

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.940
You're not special at all!

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.240
And you'll never be like Griffith!

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.070
If we ever meet on the battlefield someday...

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.370
...you'd better watch your back!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.080
Guts...

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.170
Thanks for everything...

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.280
I told you this long ago...

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.780
You belong to me.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.540
I claimed you with this sword of mine.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.420
When to go into battle, when to die... that is all up to me.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.840
If you want to free yourself from my control...

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.640
...then just as you did before...

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.890
Wrest yourself away with your blade!

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.480
Griffith!

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.940
You can't just let me go with a smile and "goodbye," huh?

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.780
I see.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.030
Wait!

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.540
Are you two serious?

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.080
You're going to cross swords even though you're comrades?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.290
Stay back, Casca!

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.090
Get out of the way.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.340
What are you saying?

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.300
If you two fight with real swords, you won't escape unharmed!

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.600
Hands off! What are you doing?

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.350
There's no way around it, under these circumstances...

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.560
What are you all doing?

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.270
We've got to stop them! They'll kill each other!

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.190
This is between the two of them.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.480
It's not our place to interfere.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.940
But we can't just...

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.950
Have you gotten so used to the genteel life that you've forgotten?

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.120
We must settle things by our swords.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.410
This is our way as mercenaries, isn't it?

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.160
But...

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.000
She's changed...

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.880
She's never hesitated before under Griffith's orders...

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.630
...even if her comrades were in mortal danger.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.670
Does she realize it herself? That she's starting to change?

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.180
His eyes look as if he's glaring at an enemy.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.270
But...

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.810
...even if he hates me or if he considers me a traitor...

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.400
I'm still going!

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.910
It's just as it was three years ago...

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.790
It all began with a sword fight... and it will end with a sword fight.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.160
I'm proud that I've come this far...

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.630
The fact you're challenging me now shows I'm valuable enough...

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.960
...for you to shed blood for.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.590
He's become immeasurably strong...

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:48.840
But...

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.470
Griffith can definitely stop him!

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.310
That's right. Then everything will be the same as it was before...

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.190
Is that my wish?

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.270
Is it my wish that...

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.200
...Guts stays with me?

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.790
He makes no attempt to display his will to fight.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.620
However, he is completely on guard...

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.500
...and his eyes are resolute.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.380
Do you really wish so much...

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.880
...to be free of my control?

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.340
No, I won't allow it!

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.560
My best chance is in the first strike...

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.520
I've got to deflect his sword as soon as he swings downward.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.310
Then I'll strike his shoulder!

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.070
If my sword strays the least bit off the mark, I could end up killing him.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.110
Nevertheless, if I can't make him mine...

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.450
I don't care!

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.880
Now!

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.370
Griffith!

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.670
Goodbye.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.560
Griffith...

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.830
Guts!

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.850
Guts is gone. He didn't even look back.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:40.970
That was a fluke!

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.640
That was definitely a fluke!

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.140
I'll never admit that he won!

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:50.820
You're going to be all right...

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.570
It's like you just stumbled over a stone in the street.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.120
It's not a big deal at all...

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.660
The place you're headed... It's far beyond this, right?

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.960
You'll be fine... You'll get back on your feet...

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.790
...and start walking again... before you know it.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.520
No, the snow is melting...

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.440
Please go to bed quickly, otherwise you will get sick, my lady.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.820
Fine, I shall retire now.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.570
You may leave now.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.650
Then good night, my lady.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.920
Sir Griffith!

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.010
Sir Griffith, what happened to you?

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.390
It's such a rainy night!

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.020
Good evening, Princess Charlotte.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.440
May I be so bold as to request entry into your chambers?

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.310
What?

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.770
If someone saw us like this, it might stain your honor, Princess.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.570
Y-Yes...

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.070
Come in... Thank you.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.410
Please excuse my rudeness, visiting a lady's bedroom...

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.910
...at such a late hour and soaking the place with rain.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.080
I missed you so much.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.050
Ever since you were sent to the battlefield...

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.670
...I have constantly been afraid that I would hear of your death.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.800
Even after you returned, so many terrifying and tragic things occurred!

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.520
Why... Why didn't you come to see me earlier?

00:18:58.690 --> 00:18:59.610
No...

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.960
Griffith...

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.590
Griffith!

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.460
Are you scared?

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.840
Stop it...

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:29.600
Your fear and sorrow... Throw everything into the fire and let it burn...

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.670
Goodbye...

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.070
Griffith?

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:22.170
Well, well, who should it be but the next White Hawk general!

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.630
To think that Your Excellency, of all people, should be here at this time.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.550
That's right. My sword was...

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.430
I will hear your story later, at my leisure.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.890
Haul him off!

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.440
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:07.080
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.120
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.090
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.350
What is that?

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.620
It's just the same.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.790
What is trying your crown?

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.970
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.300
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.010
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.680
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.030
Next Episode

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.630
A departed friend... A place that's been cast away...

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.880
Emotions thought to be abandoned...

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.080
Summoned back by the power of God's will.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.450
Even as man feels joy, he is chained by an afflicting misery.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:29.220
Why must such times of bliss pass in the blink of an eye?

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.050
Sparks
