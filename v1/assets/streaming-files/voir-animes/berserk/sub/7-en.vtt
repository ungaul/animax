WEBVTT

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.880
Yeah, struggle!

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.310
It's more fun when they fight!

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.110
What's with her?

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.100
Hey, you guys!

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.120
Luca...

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.300
Huh?

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.320
What?

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.750
Hey, what's wrong?

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.610
Starving!

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.960
Wh-What's going on here?

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.550
Meat! Meat!

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.890
Elaine!

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.320
Elaine, you...

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.880
A witch...

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.320
She's a witch.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.030
Like I said, you're just causing trouble.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.600
Don't say that. Please accept.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.360
Please give this to... You aren't giving me a choice.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.200
I'll take it, but I don't need the attention in broad daylight.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.760
Leave for now, will you?

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.470
This isn't good...

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.770
Luca, what will we do?

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.660
At this rate, someone will report us.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.190
Even if they don't, we'll be noticed by the heretic hunters.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.790
It's just a matter of time!

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.760
And when... When that happens, what then?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.910
I mean, I'm actually a—

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.900
Hey, Nina... Calm down—

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.910
How can I?!

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.250
Even if that doesn't happen,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.930
if they find Joachim's body, I'll be...

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.020
Nina...

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.530
Let's abandon her.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.170
Huh?

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.170
Let's abandon that girl.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.100
Nina, not this again!

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.520
This isn't going to work!

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.130
If we let that girl stick around,

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100
we'll be finished for sure!

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.420
It'll be fine... Elaine will be fine on her own!

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.230
She's really special, you see?!

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.940
I bet my people will treat her well if we leave her with them!

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.190
We've already taken care of her enough!

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.360
No way will I abandon anyone.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.950
Not you or Elaine.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.000
Luca...

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.270
Help, Luca!

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.250
What's wrong?

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.450
Pepe's... Pepe's been taken by the hunters!

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.450
The Black Witch

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.170
No! Let me go!

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.350
Shut up!

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.730
We've had a report!

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.380
During your trial, you can contest the claims as much as you like.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.000
That's a girl with Luca.
Pepe...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.680
Come to think of it, they've been doing well for themselves lately.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.130
I'll be raped!

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.150
I'll be killed!

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.180
Oh, God!

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.360
Damn you commoners... Shut up, will you?!

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.320
You filthy lot never say a word of prayer in your lives.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.900
But once you're in trouble, you take God's name in vain without hesitation.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.810
How wretched!
How servile!

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.430
You shameless worm!

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.580
Don't be so high and mighty when you're catching people

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.170
without risking a hair on your head!

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.340
Luca... Luca... Please have mercy.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.840
Oh?

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.590
If you defend her, you will also be imprisoned.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.540
Now you're threatening people again, to shut them up when they try to say anything.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.130
You flash your swords.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.100
You judge people from your comfortable towers.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.360
Do you people think you're angels or something?

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.110
Is that all you have to say, miss?

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.950
Pepe!
Luca!

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.850
Who would dare?

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.750
You're...

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.500
The Black Swordsman!

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.000
The Black Swordsman?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.070
How opportune... This must be God's grace at work.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.260
We won't let you go this—

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.010
Based on what that woman said,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.890
you seem to be the one leading the witch hunt.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.100
Answer me.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.400
Among the ones you captured, was there a woman with a brand on her chest?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.650
A brand?

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.150
I... I don't know!

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.290
How dare you?

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.370
W-Wow... He cut them in half!

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.020
Hey, ladies.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.290
Let's get going.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.400
Hey, your speech was pretty cool.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.920
I think I'm falling for you!

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.780
Who's this monkey?

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.400
This is my property. He's Dropey, my villa.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.980
Who're you calling "Dropey"?

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.640
And the one causing trouble

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.150
is Guts, my main estate, Black Iron Castle.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.310
There's something... ...weird.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.520
You call this a holy land?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.100
What a bad joke.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.930
It's more like a dump.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.430
Sorry for my delayed introduction. My name is Puck.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.070
I own both properties.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.260
None of this makes any sense.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.150
Okay, please stay still.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.200
My pain's going away... Out! Out of the way!

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.200
Open the way!

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.420
Report this to the main troops!

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.500
Asking a peon's getting me nowhere.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.780
I'll just have to go over there myself.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.370
A woman with a brand. Is that what you said?

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.250
Do you know her?

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.830
Hey, Guts... First, thank you for—

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.440
I don't give a shit about that!

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.950
That's the same as the one on our Elaine.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.440
Tell me... Where is she? Where is Casca?!

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.440
Luca's late.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.080
Is she okay?

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.390
If Luca's been caught, what will I do?

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.210
That's right.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.710
If that's what happened, and the heretic hunters come...

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.390
I have to run now!

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.730
Let's abandon that girl.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.210
We've already taken care of her enough!

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.990
I... Why am I like this?

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.550
Elaine, come with me.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.390
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.570
I can't leave you behind.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.010
It's scary and lonely alone.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.890
Casca...

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.390
I feel like decades have passed since I last saw you.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.630
Are you still the same as before?

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.330
The same as when you broke,

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.980
and time ground to a halt?

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.420
Oh, so that's her.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.030
Hey, sir.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:45.470
What are you to Elaine... I mean, Casca?

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.840
Hey!

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.720
Well, never mind.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.300
I kind of figured it out.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.070
Elaine! Nina!

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.770
Don't just stand there. Go inside.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.700
Huh?

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.910
No one's here.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.080
Oh, no! Were the heretic hunters here?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.700
But the place isn't ransacked.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.010
Nina's things are missing.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.070
Wait, did she...

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.810
Casca!

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.140
I'm okay... Let's go.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.100
We have come to welcome you, Lady Priestess.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.150
You...

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.780
Ha.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.280
Even if we split up to find her, this place's too big...

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.870
Dropey, why do you keep following Guts?

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.170
You're even helping him look for someone.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.960
And why are you on top of my head?

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.250
You wouldn't recognize Casca on your own.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.310
And you know what she looks like?

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.550
I saw her with my mind.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.600
What's that?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.810
Don't look!

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.530
Aren't you scaring the shit out of everyone?

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.090
They're all scaredy-cats.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.590
Still, it's strange.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.490
In places with lots of people, I should become harder to see.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.320
I wonder if this place is special.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.130
Anyway, I don't get this whole witch hunt or whatever deal,

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.370
but everyone's so scared!

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.700
Man, talk about a shit-show.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.550
After running from the Kushans,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.520
they have to fear being reported.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.050
They're drowning in quicksand.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.840
And you're different, Dropey?

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.880
'Course I am!

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.870
This is a great chance for a man to advance in the world.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.250
I don't need money to start, either.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.710
This is good enough.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.190
That's why you want to be Guts' apprentice?

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.540
You don't get it.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.220
If I have to bow and scrape to someone just to learn...

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.690
I'd rather follow them around and steal their skills like a man!

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.890
You're a thief, through and through, huh?

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.880
Well, but if I do him a favor here,

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.610
I won't have to sneak around.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.490
It's all about give and take, you know?

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.700
Hmm?

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.890
Let me go!

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.280
A bandaged woman... Are they being kidnapped?

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.560
What should we do?

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.080
If we go back to tell Guts, we'll lose them.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.150
But we can't take on that many people, either...

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.550
For now,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.470
we'll follow them.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.840
Your specialty.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.060
We have news.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.560
The heretics' lair?

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.410
This one claims he managed to escape, after being abducted by heretics.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.780
Based on his account and description of the place,

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.700
he seems to be telling the truth.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.210
Very well, we shall go forth!

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.660
There is another report.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.450
What?

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.270
Some of our men, transporting heretics from the refugee camp,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.190
have been attacked.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.830
There have been several casualties.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.490
How many enemies are we talking about?

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.210
According to the knights who retreated, only one.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.090
What?

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.840
A giant man in black, with a sword as long as he is tall.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.660
The Black Swordsman... Is this true?

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.660
Yes, sir. We believe so.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.040
This must be God's hand at work!

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.230
We will not let him go a second time!

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.560
Unfortunately, we must ask you to take us to the heretics' lair.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.690
Of course.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.110
Bingo.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.150
Guess this is the heretics' lair.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.430
Hear me!

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:02.060
Tonight will be a holy night, which will be retold by posterity.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.720
That tower has become a source of clever lies,

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.760
a den for swine who seek to oppress and rule us!

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.910
But we know the truth.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.250
We know whom we should truly worship.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.020
We know who possesses true power!

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.560
In advance of the promised day,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.780
our master has given us a sign tonight!

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.280
It's Casca!

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.040
That's her...

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.040
It is our priestess, the Black Witch!

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.520
She is the symbol of our faith.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.610
She is a miracle in herself!

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.400
And on this joyous eve,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.920
one of the faithful will be fortunate enough to receive more honor

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.800
than she deserves!

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.700
No!

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.560
Let me go!

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.550
It's the girl who was with Casca!

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.620
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.260
I think something bad's gonna happen.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.460
Rejoice, Daughter Nina.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.210
Your sin, in trying to keep her to yourself,

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.090
will be redeemed by your act of duty.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.240
We will now remove this one's heart,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.490
as an offering to the witch.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.830
After, we will have her consummate her union with our Great Goat,

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.830
to become a true member of our family!

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.090
Shit's getting real!

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.000
What now, what now, what now?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.760
If we try to get Guts now, we won't be back in time!

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.010
Hey, Puck...

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.350
I'll buy us time.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.730
Fly as fast as you can, and get Guts.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.820
I didn't know you had actual skills.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.480
Shut up!

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.930
I kind of have the advantage here, you know?

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.580
Oh, no... N-No!

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.870
Oh, nice! Well done!

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.810
You think better of me now?

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.290
I'd rather not have gone this route if I could've helped it.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.880
It's a cheap trick for a man who's gonna make it big with his sword!

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.300
A thief... who throws rocks...

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.090
"Isidoro" means "rock-throwing thief"!

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.300
I knew you'd say that.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.190
Hey, you cultist asses!

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:20.170
Quit your rites and shit in that crappy, moldy hole of yours!

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.870
I'm gonna report you!

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.460
Okay, go, Puck!

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.240
Roger.
Throw!

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.920
Throw until your iron left arm breaks!

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.820
Make sure you talk me up to Guts!

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.750
Drag him down!

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.740
We'll sacrifice him, too.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:36.370
Ha!

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.940
You worthless shits can't do anything unless you're in a mob!

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.900
You're the ones to be sacrificed to my ambition!

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.780
Take that!

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.620
Fools!

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.090
All critical hits!

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.090
Lots of rocks here.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.050
It's been a year since I left my village.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.700
Wandering aimlessly through areas where bandits and Kushans roamed,

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.220
there were lots of near misses and days with no food or drink.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.330
But it's all paid off.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.670
I have a big chance for the taking, waiting right in front of me.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.970
There's no way I'm gonna miss it.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.350
As long as I can get through this,

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.430
I can achieve my goal!

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.240
I will win, no matter what it takes!

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.320
What're you all doing?!

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.140
That boy... What is he doing?

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.620
Elaine, let's get out while we can.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:22.830
What's wrong?

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.890
What the hell?

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.820
Elaine?

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.320
That's the place.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:55.960
Good!

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.480
Units one through four, follow me!

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.850
The rest of you, spread out and cover the entrance.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.500
Capture all who attempt escape!

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.890
Forward!

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.300
Subdue them!

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.150
Heretics!

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.570
Resistance will be dealt with harshly!

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.510
Help...

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.020
Wh-What?

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.600
What's going on with them?

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.770
H-Help!

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.740
Wh-What?

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.240
Who are they?

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.000
Vice-Commander Azan!

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.240
Azan, what is going on?

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:54.990
I have heard that heretics employ various drugs during their rites.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:18:00.210
Perhaps some of them turn men into beasts?

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.650
Drugs... I see.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.160
Beware.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.820
They now have the strength of many grown men.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.230
Drugs?

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.650
Could drugs really be the cause?

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.980
This is like... It reminds me of when...

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.240
Special throw... It'll split your head right open!

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.870
Yeah!

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.950
But... What the hell's going on?

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.250
The hunter troops are coming in droves, too.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.210
Shit's really going down now.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.310
You weirdo!

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:37.650
Hup!
Hmph!

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.200
Take that!

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.930
A-Am I gonna die?

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.230
H-Hey.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.820
Okay, ladies, time to get outta here.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.280
Who are you?

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.270
I'm Isidoro.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.860
The details can wait!

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.940
Thanks.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.120
But...

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.700
We can't go that way.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.870
Hmm?

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.370
A-ha...

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.130
Hurry!

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.140
M-My horns are stuck.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.750
Just leave them behind!

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:24.970
H-Help—

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.930
Lady Farnese!

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.150
This cannot continue...

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.280
We should retreat and regroup.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.160
You're right.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.500
A boy?

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.450
Why is a boy here?

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.070
This is... An actual monster?

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.610
Are they all monsters?

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.430
It's like before.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.610
It's just like that night...

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.340
You're knights, aren't you?

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.750
Hold the line and fight, cowards!

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.280
Elaine!

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.550
Man, I'm freezing...

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.210
Seems they're having a lot of trouble inside.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.610
Huh? Did something pass through?

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:50.350
Huh?

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.070
You asses!

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:08.590
Witch... Consummate... Become family...

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.980
You pervy goat!

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.900
Don't get so excited!

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.460
No! Do not let him get away!

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.550
Baeeeeeeh!

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.510
I'm leaving Casca to you.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.510
Luca, I can't. I...

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520
Sorry to keep you waiting, Black Swordsman.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.220
