00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.770
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.450
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.380
At least it is true...

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.490
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.230
Not my choice...

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.360
I was not...

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.940
I was not born as a woman by choice!

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.270
What I can't forgive is how your selfishness nearly got Griffith killed!

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.820
I don't care if you drop dead somewhere in battle!

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.250
But I'll never forgive you if you ruin the Band of the Hawk, Griffith's dream!

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.920
And I can't forgive you for making Griffith change like he has...

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.960
Why?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.700
Why did he choose you?

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.470
Why you?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.320
Feel no shame about shape.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.270
Weather changes their phrase.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.000
Even mother will show you another way.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.400
So put your glasses on.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.470
Nothing will be wrong.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.670
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.510
It's up to you.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.170
The first words should be found.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.780
Whatever holds you back.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.450
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.290
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.390
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.360
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.160
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.400
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.030
It's too late.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.830
Prepared for Death

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.910
What's the matter?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.050
Are you giving up?

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.690
Oh brother, a woman can be such a nuisance.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.730
A woman has no strength. She can lose her temper at the drop of a hat.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.830
Not only that, but you're on your period.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.240
At any rate, women just aren't cut out for war.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.930
You know nothing about women!

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.200
Of course not. I'm a man, so how could I know?

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.310
What I do know is that we don't have the time...

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.870
...to be stranded here by your woman problems any longer.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.690
The enemy doesn't care about your condition or if you are a woman or not.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.550
On second thought... they are probably glad, wouldn't you say?

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.070
Let's move!

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.160
What the hell?

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.920
Hey, is this a breeding ground for swarms of mosquitoes?

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.760
I found you.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.000
I am glad you are alive, kid!

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.740
Hey, old man, you're looking pretty good yourself.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.470
Shut up!

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.310
Even though it was a fluke, a bastard like you caused me some real trouble.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.410
I, a proud Tudor knight, could not bear to die without rectifying the situation!

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.640
Oh, really?

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.220
I'm not going to let you die easily.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.890
I will haul you off as a captive and expose you to hell on earth.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.560
You'll enjoy a secret torture technique, the 100-year Monzetsu Goroshi...

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.800
...that has been passed down through the Coborlwitz family for 200 years!

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.130
I didn't think you'd still be holding a grudge.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.840
If you surrender without protest, I'll spare you.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.140
But if you want to cross us...

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.080
...we'll chop off your arms along with any other body parts we like!

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.670
So long as you're alive, it does not matter.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.810
As for the woman, we will make her a plaything for my soldiers right here!

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.090
I have to suggest that you don't try that.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.650
She is a truly scary woman.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.050
She'll rip you to shreds.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.990
How dare you joke around with me!

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.530
Beat them down!

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.930
I don't need your help anymore!

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.900
Great!

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.080
Damn!

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.700
There are only two of them!

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.580
Don't hesitate!

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.140
Overwhelm them in a single charge!

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.810
They are incompetents, every one of them.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.340
Samson!

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.340
Samson!

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.310
Here, Big Brother!

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.060
Assistant commander of the Blue Whale Heavy Assault Knights...

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.120
Samson!

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.010
He is my younger brother and second strongest warrior in my entire unit!

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.470
Additionally, Samson's armor is three times as thick as anyone else's!

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.510
Even buried under an avalanche, he would be absolutely indestructible!

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:43.620
On top of that, his iron ball can crush a buffalo's head flat in a single blow!

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.410
If a man gets hit squarely by it, nothing will remain but a piece of flesh!

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.060
Now, I give you no quarter!

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.960
Have them experience firsthand...

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.930
...the esteemed techniques of the Coborlwitz family!

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.000
A sword would be smashed if used to block his attacks directly.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.340
What should we do?

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.460
He knocked it back?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.870
I can't believe it...

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.670
He's beating back every blow from Samson's iron ball...

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.940
Oh, I see!

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.310
He has no time to dodge the blows because of their incredible speed!

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.980
No... With Guts's skill...

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.490
...he should be able to evade and attack.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.960
There's no need for him to damage his sword like that...

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.930
He's protecting me...

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.040
He's injured...

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.880
The arrow wound I inflicted upon you when...

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.940
...you were trying to protect that woman seems to be bothering you!

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.590
Quit your dawdling!

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.850
He's been injured!

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.650
Finish him off quickly!

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.290
Hey!

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.260
I'll clear the way for you...

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.760
...and then you sprint for the woods.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:35.860
But...

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.240
What the...

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.370
S-Samson...

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:14.540
Now!

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.660
Get away from here!

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.510
Get your ass moving!

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.410
Run!

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.770
But... What are you doing?

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.710
Go right now!

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.170
No way...

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.880
I just can't...

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.850
I won't leave without you!

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.850
Shoot!

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.060
Aim for the woman and kill her off!

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:41.900
Foolish!

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.360
You repeatedly get wounded on behalf of a mere woman.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.470
How stupid you are!

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.040
Why?

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.040
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.950
A sickly person is of no use here, so I want you to get lost.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.920
It's not my nature to evade the enemy.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.420
Besides, I've got to get even with that sniveling bastard.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:17.490
As you said, maybe I'm content just wielding my sword...

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.200
But you're different, right?

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.510
Do you want to die in a place like this?

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.370
Do you want to die a meaningless death in this little skirmish?

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.980
Has the wish you hold in your heart rotted away that much?

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.960
There are times when a sword needs to be sheathed.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.090
Go back to the sheath that protects you.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.330
Go back to Griffith.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.280
Go back to the sheath that protects you.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.420
Go back to Griffith.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.510
Hurry up!

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.110
Run!

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.320
Go!

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.580
Get out of here!

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.620
I promise to return with our comrades!

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.130
Don't die until then!

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.300
Don't let her get away!

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.030
Get her and kill her off!

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.800
You shouldn't go chasing after women until you get your work done...

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.470
...you scheming cowards!

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.240
You bastard!

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.750
W-What a man!

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.920
He beats armored men as if they were cherries to be picked.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.450
It's unbelievable, but a man drops every time he swings his sword!

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.060
I didn't know that such a man existed among the enemy lines.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.270
My sword is blunt. The blade has gotten dull.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.040
However, it's three times as thick and three times as heavy as any other.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.910
Just hope you die when I hit you, or you'll be in lots of pain.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.680
You son of a bitch!

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.950
Look here!

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.250
All of you, stop dawdling!

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.860
Though he is skilled, the enemy is only one wounded man!

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.860
All we have to do is surround him, and he'll be finished!

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.120
We number one hundred men!

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.130
Get him!

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.130
Don't talk nonsense.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.200
Is there anyone who wants to take revenge for Samson?

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.900
No one wants to.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.940
Are you all really proud knights of Tudor?

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.840
Actually, we're mercenaries over here.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.310
I will pay triple the reward I promised if someone beheads him...

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.550
No, wait. I'll even increase the amount by five...

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.620
And I'll guarantee your promotion to battalion commander!

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.020
F-Five times the reward... What should we do?

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.560
Naturally, we've got to give it a shot.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.270
It looks like he can't move around too much with that wound.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.900
It'll be possible if we get a group of five men or so to challenge him.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.700
What are you bitching about?

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.540
I'm leaving then.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.410
That's right. That's how mercenaries have to be.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.380
Right?

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:13.530
Pursuers?

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.270
Four...

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.130
No, there are five...

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.460
Die!

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.130
Pull yourself together!

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.700
Damn it, that bitch... Get her!

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.030
What are you doing?

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.760
Kill him at once!

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.270
We did it!

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:31.650
Good!

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.410
We've crippled his left hand now!

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.080
He won't be able to wield his huge sword so easily.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.590
Beat him!

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.200
Now it's getting interesting.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.630
This is the end...

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.530
I can't run anymore...

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.560
Oopsie, I bet you'd like to get your hands on that.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.500
You put us through a lot of trouble, girl.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.170
We can put you out of your misery soon, but...

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:06.700
A whole bunch of my comrades were killed by you, so...

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.680
Before killing you off, I've got to thank you for that.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.590
Don't glower at me like that.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:34.200
I'm offering you all the fun you want right before setting out for the afterlife.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.400
You should show me some gratitude.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.110
Well, well...

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.950
What's wrong? Are you embarrassed?

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.460
I don't care if you command a thousand men in battle or not...

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.360
Now look at you. You don't seem to have any authority over me at all.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.070
I'm unable to push this bastard aside...

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:18.310
My... My arm is so powerless...

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.690
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.330
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.370
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.340
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.600
What is that?

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.870
It's just the same.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.040
What is trying your crown?

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.220
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.550
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.260
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.930
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.190
Next Episode

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:13.290
In every man's heart burns a flame that can never be extinguished.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.600
This flickering fire is what ignites a man's ambition...

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.340
...warms a man's heart, and incinerates a man's emotions.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.630
The question arises...

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.710
Will the flame of fate ever be extinguished as long as man lives?

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.220
