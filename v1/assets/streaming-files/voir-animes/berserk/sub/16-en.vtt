00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.640
In this world...

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.450
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.350
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.120
At least it is true...

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.220
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.160
We are reaching a crucial moment.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.730
Our backs are to the river!

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.110
There's no way to escape!

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.840
Lay down your lives!

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.410
If you don't, we are doomed!

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.780
If we can survive... ...then we'll have won!

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.360
Feel no shame about shape.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.310
Weather changes their phrase.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.040
Even mother will show you another way.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.440
So put your glasses on.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.510
Nothing will be wrong.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.710
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.550
It's up to you.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.210
The first words should be found.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.820
Whatever holds you back.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.490
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.330
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.430
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.400
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.200
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.440
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.070
It's too late.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.880
The Conqueror

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.890
This dry sand is flying everywhere.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.160
I can't see anything.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.130
Well, it seems certain that our army will win.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.370
Did you notice everyone in the castle has taken off?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.870
After all, whoever captures the enemy leader will get any reward he asks for!

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.840
So every last one of them is going after the reward?

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.850
What rotten luck! Here we are standing as sentries at a time like this!

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.920
Hey, what's wrong?

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.790
The enemy?

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.360
Where the hell did they come from?

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.000
Charge!

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.310
First formation, block off the castle gates!

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.710
Do not allow enemy messengers to leave the castle!

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.340
Got it!

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.420
The rest of you, carry out the operation!

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.440
Hurry!

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.990
There isn't a moment to lose!

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.050
Is that...

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.360
You go from the right!

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.960
On the double!

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.270
Cover the castle gate and the castle walls!

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.130
Forget about their command center!

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.720
Adon to the rescue!

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.520
It's you...

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.820
I'll give you credit for being a persistent devil.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.700
I am well-known as the indestructible baron, Adon!

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.910
Everyone inevitably prostrates themselves before my great vitality!

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.300
I, Adon, already saw through all your cheap tricks long ago!

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.310
Therefore, I offered my services as castle guard...

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.820
...and I waited patiently as you marched ignorantly toward us.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.020
You lie.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.620
I do not lie!

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.250
Everyone, step forward!

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.520
Behold!

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.230
The Blue Whale Super Strong Heavy Assault Knights!

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.570
I purposely left my troops inside the castle for just such an occasion!

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.610
Now I am going to have my revenge for the previous battle!

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.630
Listen!

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.900
Do not allow any of them to escape with their lives.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.840
Charge!

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.240
Let's go!

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.480
I'll avenge my brother Samson's death!

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.020
I give you no quarter!

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.940
What's taking them?

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.910
I have been kept waiting for Griffith's capture too long!

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.170
I have a report!

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.840
A single horseman of great skill blocks our way to Count Griffith.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.690
Our armed forces cannot readily get closer to him...

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.080
You're all worthless!

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.020
Who the hell is this man?

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.000
Is there no one who can stop him?

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.210
General Boscone!

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.770
The general himself?

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.880
What?

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.290
Unbelievable... Stay out of it!

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.150
We'll be in trouble if we get caught up in this fierce battle!

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.530
Amazing!

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.160
That's our big sister all right!

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.360
Why is this?

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.930
Your swordplay is so different than before!

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.670
I wasn't feeling too well back then.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.940
The hell you weren't!

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.670
Don't make poor excuses...

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.940
Wait until I'm finished speaking!

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.080
Why don't you keep your mouth closed for a moment?

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.520
The enemy has only a small number!

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.750
Don't let up! Overcome them!

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.650
The Band of the Hawk's future rests on this battle!

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.640
Thank you, Pippin!

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.220
Damn it!

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.750
It's just a matter of time before we're wiped out!

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.480
Just look at their numbers!

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.680
What are you talking about, Corkus?

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.950
Are you saying we should retreat?

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.190
I'm not saying that, but...

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.160
I'd rather go down fighting than run away!

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.630
Oh no!

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.570
Little Rickert has gone insane!

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:09.960
He's right!

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.370
I agree with Rickert!

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.540
My army is utterly overwhelming them!

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.910
Attack them!

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.040
Keep on attacking and overpower them!

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:29.520
Boscone, why are you spending so much time on a mere horseman?

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.160
Strong!

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.400
This guy is... ...truly strong...

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.670
I feel closer to death now than when I was slaughtering a hundred men.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.940
I'm going to have to put everything on the line...

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.410
...or I'll die!

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.940
No...

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.710
I've been through worse...

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.060
This hopelessness is nothing compared to what I felt then...

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.290
How dare you... Only one thing to do now!

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.160
I am terribly sorry!

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.460
What?

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.560
I beg your pardon for my lack of courtesy. Please forgive me!

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.940
After all, I'm just a lowly commander following orders from the general.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.010
Personally, I've never wanted any sort of grudge against you!

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.100
Now, now...

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.150
If it's this castle you want, please take it!

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.670
I'm the last person who would stand in your way...

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.180
...so please, if you would kindly spare my life...

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.280
What a disgusting man...

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.320
My clever ruse has put you off guard...

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:15.360
Big sister!

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.230
Foolish woman!

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.070
That was Ressha Jinrai, the secret art of the crossbow sneak attack...

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.540
...passed down the Coborlwitz family for one thousand years!

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.310
The tip of the arrow was poisoned, and it will numb your entire body.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.480
Your days of sinful deeds are over, you little bitch!

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.150
I can't afford...

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.120
...to waste my time playing your foolish games...

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.150
...any longer!

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.470
This is bad...

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.400
My sword was chipped and cracked in that hundred-man fight...

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.170
This is the end... ...for the commander of the Raiders!

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.330
Here I come!

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.930
If you put down your sword like a good girl...

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.940
...I might consider letting you live, as my personal toy.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.840
But if you refuse...

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.050
Take that, and that!

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.640
Take that and that and that!

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.710
Damn it, my body is numb, and I'm helpless...

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.350
Big sister!

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.600
Well, what are you going to do?

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.200
There's nowhere for you to run now...

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.430
For what you did to my face...

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.170
Be prepared to lose at least an arm and a leg!

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.610
Then you can tell me whether or not you want to be my captive...

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.910
...and I'll listen at my leisure!

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.250
Your legs go first!

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.390
What?

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.030
Impossible!

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.740
You were a fairly interesting man.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.670
Despite being an irredeemable, revolting bastard!

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.350
Now!

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.580
The rest are no match for us!

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.710
Cut them down!

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.430
Now then...

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.440
Help the commander!

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.680
Get back!

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:20.910
You're no match for him!

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.620
Get out of the way!

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.600
Guts!

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.610
Take up that sword!

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.300
Damn, he managed to do it!

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.470
Amazing...

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.710
Utterly worthless!

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.040
That can't be!

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.870
The invincible Sir Boscone... You fools!

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.480
Even if the general's been defeated...

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.380
...our force still has the upper hand in this battle!

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.390
How can you falter now?

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.280
Governor, look at that!

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.490
What's that?

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.670
T-That is...

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.270
The enemy's flag?

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.070
Our castle surrendered?

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.400
What's the meaning of this?

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.010
Don't you get it yet?

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.210
Your commander's dead.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.210
Your castle has fallen!

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.410
That can only mean one thing, right?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.490
You've lost this battle!

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.120
We lost?

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.660
We really lost?

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.860
Everyone, shout!

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.150
Give a shout of triumph!

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.200
From now on, we will hunt the remnants of the enemy.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.040
Only let the enemy pass if they immediately flee!

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.980
If they resist, exterminate every last one of them!

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.590
Wait, everyone!

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.160
I am the commander in chief!

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.100
I am still alive!

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:13.750
Griffith...

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.660
It's been a while, Governor Gennon...

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.120
Oh, Griffith...

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.390
I missed you so much.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.260
You and I always helped one another.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.390
So you'll let me escape unharmed, won't you?

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.100
I gave my own soldiers the order that...

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.930
...you were not to be harmed under any circumstances.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.410
Of course you understand the feelings in my heart, don't you?

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.040
Not a day passed that I did not think of you.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.450
We yearned for each other so passionately that night...

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.850
You will listen to my plea, won't you?

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.150
Don't tell me...

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.530
...you bear any ill will toward me?

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.690
I do not bear any ill feelings at all, Governor.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.760
Oh, then you...

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.870
However, it upsets me when you speak of us yearning for one another...

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.180
...for I feel absolutely nothing for you at all.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.040
Neither ill feelings nor otherwise...

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.140
What are you talking about, Griffith?

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:21.890
I took advantage of an opportunity, and you happened to be there at the time.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.750
I just picked up a pebble lying in my path...

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.990
...and it happened to be you.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:30.900
Y-You bastard!

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.640
At any rate, a chattering pebble can be quite a nuisance.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.310
Unbelievable!

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.880
We finally did it!

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.620
Can you believe it?

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.050
Are you all right?

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.760
Yeah... I'm feeling a bit better...

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.990
Don't worry about me.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.430
You must go and make sure that no enemies remain within the castle.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.160
Right!

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:06.160
Hey, get moving.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.200
We've got a job to do!

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.960
All right!

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.890
Hey, good job.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.000
What's wrong?

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.340
Just a scratch...

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.910
But to tell you the truth...

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.370
I'd like for you to give me your shoulder.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.690
Amazing...

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.020
Hey... I always feel like this...

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.920
Whenever I see Griffith surrounded by his comrades like that...

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.400
I don't know why, but my heart becomes filled with sorrow.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.240
Because he seems to be so far away...

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.010
...beyond my reach.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.840
That's not true...

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.690
Hey, what are you doing?

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.250
Let's go.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.390
To see your captain.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:44.460
Yeah...

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.780
No, it couldn't have been...

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.220
The time of the Great Eclipse is near.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.090
And the devils will soon descend...

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.110
Doldrey Castle has fallen.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.380
Thus, this war that we have waged for so long will be over.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.210
Then Griffith will be free...

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.090
...to let his political views intrude into the administration of our kingdom.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.120
He is presumptuous enough to do such things despite his low social rank.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.830
His Majesty seems to trust him very much.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.090
Because of his recent achievements, he will attain the position of general.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.200
Is that true?

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.300
I hear His Majesty will be conferring the supreme title of White Knights...

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.430
...on Griffith and the Band of the Hawk, putting them on equal footing...

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.140
...with the White Tigers and the White Dragon Knights!

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.300
Ridiculous!

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.710
That will only swell his head even more!

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:14.150
He knows how to survive in battle, but the noble court is another story.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.950
What is that?

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.150
Antiaris... ...a poison that acts instantaneously...

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.890
We shall use this on him...

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.620
Are you sure about this?

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.630
No matter what, our scheme must not be traced back to us.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.040
We will not do such a thing ourselves.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.770
However... Do not fear.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:38.980
Your Majesty!

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.810
You can leave everything in my hands...

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.010
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.650
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.690
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.660
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.920
What is that?

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.190
It's just the same.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:22.360
What is trying your crown?

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.540
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.870
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:36.850
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.580
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.250
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.060
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.760
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.940
Next Episode Why does man aspire to reach the top?

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:17.740
To win thunderous applause... Why does man yearn for this so?

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.790
Dreams, ambition, love, hope...

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:30.230
Could this youthful arrogance be cause for others to strike one down?

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.390
Moment of Glory
