00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.190
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.070
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.740
At least it is true...

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.040
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.880
I told you this long ago...

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.550
You belong to me.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.890
If you want to free yourself from my control...

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.510
...then just as you did before...

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.020
Wrest yourself away with your blade!

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.650
Goodbye...

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.760
Feel no shame about shape.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.710
Weather changes their phrase.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.440
Even mother will show you another way.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.840
So put your glasses on.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.910
Nothing will be wrong.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.110
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.950
It's up to you.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.610
The first words should be found.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.220
Whatever holds you back.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.890
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.730
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.830
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.800
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.600
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.840
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.470
It's too late.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.480
Sparks

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.920
They look brave enough.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.890
So many plucky fellows have gathered to fight in my tournament!

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.980
My lord, the final match will begin at any moment.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.270
He is a mercenary named Valencia, well-known as the Prince of Massacre.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.480
It's been said that he slaughtered...

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.700
...over one hundred thirty Midland soldiers during the hundred-year war.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.420
I am quite sure that Valencia will win...

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.970
Who is he?

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.890
Hey, what are you doing?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.770
Can't you tell?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.850
I'm a challenger.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.020
That's ridiculous!

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.900
I'm his rightful opponent!

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.030
Hey, don't be such a stiff.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.530
It's supposed to be a festive event.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.080
You look pretty formidable.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.580
What do you say? How about taking me on?

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.960
My lord...

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.090
Very well, I'll allow it! It's a sideshow before the final bout. Go on then!

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.470
Hey, now you're talking!

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.060
Even if this is for entertainment, a duel is a duel.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.930
I'll give no quarter!

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.640
I wouldn't have it any other way!

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.270
Take your stance!

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.610
No need, come anytime.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.240
Ridiculous!

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.240
Are you telling me you won't even take your stance?

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.410
I-I-I yield... Well, well!

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.160
That man did it!

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.000
Well done, well done.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.050
Now then, would you be interested in serving me?

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.930
Needless to say, I'll pay you very well.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.140
Thanks, but I'm not interested in that sort of thing...

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.060
My lord... What a shame...

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.810
Not to put a man of his caliber to use...

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.580
Guts!

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.250
Guts!

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.750
Welcome back!

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.500
Easy, easy.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.420
I was worried about you...

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.010
...because you were gone when I woke up!

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.680
But Grandpa Godot was right after all.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.680
He told me that you would come back here for sure!

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.530
Sorry, but I need you to fix this again.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.700
Really!

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.120
After sitting around and doing nothing for a week...

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.580
...you suddenly try your skill in a tournament.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.910
I see...

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.000
You fought against a very skilled man this time...

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.960
A sword doesn't lie.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.760
This sword tells me everything about both you and your opponent.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.050
Oh, this poor sword of yours...

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.430
It's wielded by a man who's blind to his own destiny.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.610
Let me fix the sword, please?

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.230
When you're a little older, Erica.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.550
My destiny...

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.760
My dream...

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.520
Does this sword embody my dream?

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.520
Guts!

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.310
Here we go!

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.360
Okay!

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.300
Guts!

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.480
I guess it was too much to deal with at once, after all!

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.980
Yeah, it was.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.570
This is no dream.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.150
This has always been by my side.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.660
That's right. It's a part of my body.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.460
Through all the pain I could hardly endure...

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.130
All those moments when I was sure of my death...

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.970
I overcame them all with this sword by my side.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.230
Here's one!

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.860
Unforgettable memories... Unforgettable people...

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.030
I've sensed them all at sword point.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.790
This sword is proof of my very existence.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.590
Guts!

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.010
Guts!

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.090
Ouch!

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.510
Come on, stay still!

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.100
You are quite reckless.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.450
Godot, why did you become a swordsmith?

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.330
We've been a family of swordsmiths for generations.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.250
Do you like it?

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.750
I don't know.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.000
You don't know?

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.920
Erica likes it because it's fun.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.340
I want to be a swordsmith too!

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.920
Hey, be careful.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.680
I've gripped steel before even learning to walk.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.220
I strike...

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.520
...the iron lying before me...

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.610
...without thinking about whether I like it or not.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.820
I've always strived to improve my skill... To forge even better swords...

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.070
But then before I knew it, I became an old man.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:29.120
Why do I continue striking iron? The truth is I have no idea.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.590
But... there is one certain thing that I do like about it.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.090
Sparks...

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.840
I like seeing the sparks...

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.640
I'm absorbed by them.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.600
For a moment, I can feel as if my life is sparking before my eyes.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.990
Sparks...

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.620
Am I also attracted...

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.000
...to sparks?

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.290
Light cascading off swords... Tiny sparks...

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.800
For as long as my opponents and I have lived...

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.300
Our swords crash into our very being, scattering tiny sparks of light...

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.520
These sparks are like life itself.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.440
Guts, ready?

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.400
Yeah!

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.250
You did it!

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.840
Guts!

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.670
Finally, you did it!

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.130
At the end of the day, there's nothing left for me but this.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:13.600
I wield my sword... not for anyone else, but for myself...

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.940
To generate my own sparks, even if it's for a fleeting moment.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.470
Are you leaving?

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.850
Yeah, thanks for your help.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.390
After being sheltered for nearly a year, that's all you have to say to me?

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.600
Take care of yourself.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.070
Of course I will! I don't need you to tell me.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.280
So long.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.700
Hey...

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.240
Don't get yourself killed.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.000
Master Godot!

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.220
What's the idea, coming over here so early in the morning?

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.060
Do I even have to explain? I'm here to place an order!

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.230
An order?

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:44.270
I want you to make as many swords as you can immediately.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.480
Of course, I'll pay you handsomely for this.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.400
What's going on?

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.030
Did war break out?

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.950
No... We're hunting down bandits!

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.580
Hunting bandits?

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.990
Those fugitives we've been hearing about...

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.620
They're hiding in the mountains just over the border.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.210
I need weapons so I can make some easy money before it's too late.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.880
Fugitives?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.960
You haven't heard?

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.300
You neither, master?

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.170
Well, no surprise.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.300
You guys live like hermits down here, after all!

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.010
Who are they, these bandits on the run?

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.640
They were once members of a mercenary band that led a revolt...

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.440
...in Windham about a year ago.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:22.940
A mercenary band?

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.440
Yes, I'm told that they are led by a woman with incredible skills.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:29.070
A woman?

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.200
I heard that they also made quite an impact in the hundred-year war.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.830
I don't remember the name though...

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.870
...probably the band of something... Band of... Yes!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.080
The Band of the Hawk!

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.130
Wait, what did you just say?

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.050
Huh?

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.760
I'm asking you what you just said!

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.050
W-Well...

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.970
I said the Band of the Hawk, led by a woman named Casca.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.030
We finally found them... ...the Band of the Hawk.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.030
Damn, they gave us a lot of trouble.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:22.080
Stop complaining. Remember, they're not going to live past this night!

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.210
We'll make sure they get a good night's sleep!

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.460
Don't work too hard... You won't be able to keep it up.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.040
Judeau...

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.710
I understand your feelings.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.960
But you're essentially the leader of the Band of the Hawk.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.300
Everyone's exhausted because we've been on the run for so long.

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.970
At a time like this, we can't have you collapsing too!

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.140
I know.

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.600
A moment ago, I got a report from our comrades...

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.100
...who infiltrated Windham.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.060
According to their report, Griffith is confined in an underground dungeon...

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.110
...located at the lowest level of Windham Palace.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:38.450
Some of them have heard a distant voice from the depths of the prison...

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.530
It could be him screaming or moaning.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.540
However...

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.250
...the voice has not been heard within this month.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.960
Everyone is exhausted.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.630
We can't live on the run much longer. We've got to hurry!

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.550
Believe in them.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.470
You've got to believe in your comrades.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.680
We have no choice but to pool our talents together, every one of us.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.020
Judeau...

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.020
Anyways, you should at least get some rest.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.020
You can't organize our mission to rescue Griffith if you are so tired...

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.650
You are right... You need to eat and rest.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.270
Yeah...

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.320
Judeau...

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.990
Thank you.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.230
How's Casca?

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.320
Taking a little rest.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.950
She should.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.570
Lately, she hasn't slept at all.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.580
I think she's been doing a fine job.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.410
If she hadn't assumed leadership, by now we'd all be...

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.210
You're right. We might not have survived this far...

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.090
We've survived, but what good has that done us?

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:29.550
Even if we make it out alive and try to start fresh in some country...

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.510
It could never happen!

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:37.270
First of all, without Griffith, we're just sheep without a shepherd.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.400
We can't accomplish a thing.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.770
What are you talking about?

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.900
It's obvious we need him, but that's why we're all trying to rescue him!

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.860
Can you prove that Griffith is even still alive?

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.040
Who knows. It might be over...

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.250
All over for him...

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.080
Then why are you here, Corkus?

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.090
Why didn't you leave with the deserters?

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.640
Rickert...

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.600
I wish he was here for us...

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.770
What is it?

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:32.830
Enemy raid!

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.170
The enemy is in the north woods!

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.340
Third company, fourth company, counterattack!

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.170
All others, get the injured on carriages and ride to the southern quarter!

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.280
Casca!

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.990
I have you!

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.010
Stay alert, Captain.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.510
Guts...

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.420
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:08.060
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.100
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.070
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.330
What is that?

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.600
It's just the same.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.770
What is trying your crown?

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.950
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.280
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.990
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.660
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.940
Next Episode

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:13.690
Unless man loses a precious thing, he will never know its true value.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.450
When he is utterly weary, and the path to his dream has been crushed...

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.290
...it is then that a dim light pierces the darkness.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:30.420
Why can man not live in bliss unless he embraces his wounded heart?

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.970
Confession
