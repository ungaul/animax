WEBVTT

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.530
Give it back... Give back... My warm body...

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.500
Oh, no...

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.300
Let's go home, Elaine!

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.510
It's getting dark.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.510
A Nighttime Feast: Burning at the Stake

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.290
Wow... I knew it, he's...

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.060
Shit!

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.430
He took off without me again!

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.540
He won't leave me behind!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.010
Hey, we've been on the move since yesterday.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.030
If you don't rest, you'll be exhausted when we reach our destination.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.590
I wonder what happened to the boy.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.770
His nasty looks and stubbornness kind of reminded me of you, Guts.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.900
Yeah, right.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.390
No sudden stops!

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.860
Be more considerate of your host!

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.030
What is it this time?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.140
Someone I've known for a long time.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.750
You look to be in good health, Struggler.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.620
An elf?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.690
An interesting choice of companions.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.840
Huh?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.260
He's kind of...

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.870
Been a while, old man.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.620
What are you doing out here?

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.410
I am a foe to otherworldly beings.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.190
You will soon learn what lies ahead.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.690
There's an Apostle nearby?

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.510
Or their root cause.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.290
You don't mean... They're...

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.200
The God Hand is here?

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.580
Did you not also see the shining hawk in your dreams?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.120
That was a revelation.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.410
That someone, who signifies the hawk, will appear in this mortal world.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.210
The hawk... The hawk?

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.700
The flocks of sheep are being guided to a blood-stained holy land.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.990
What they seek is a hawk of light.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.170
When the place of power attains a critical threshold, what normally lies in

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.980
the realm of gods is incarnated, once every thousand years.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.430
You and the girl will find yourselves thrown into that maelstrom,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.570
as though tracing a passage through time.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.780
The Eclipse...

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.120
An event similar to the Eclipse is about to occur.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.150
It's about to...

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.760
It's going to happen again?

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.140
Joy?

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.400
Unfortunately, no man possesses the means to change this festival's outcome.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.710
A shadow will be born.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.530
It will simply be a shadow cast by a dying sun that shines on a faraway land.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.190
You're saying the outcome will be the same as last time?

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.350
That we are both here, without meaning to be,

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.300
is proof beyond reproach.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.980
We are already caught in the whorls of karma.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.730
Shadows, karma... Like I give a damn.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.750
In the past, I borrowed your powers, sure.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.760
But this time, I will draw on my own strength to save her!

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.770
And I'll...

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.500
Perhaps that brand will be of assistance to you.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.590
What?

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.990
A word of advice.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.830
Do not have more than one that you care for.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.330
Man, what is our holy commander thinking?

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.490
Why is she kissing up to Father Mozgus?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.930
Yeah, she sure has some noble faith.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.820
Hey, she can hear you!

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.320
Oh, my apologies... Please be more careful!

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.850
Come on...

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.370
Don't waste food.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.900
Why is a klutz like him the officer of arms?

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.810
Sorry.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.840
Because he wags his tail and falls over himself to please her, that's why.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.470
Anyway, we have even more of them now.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.510
More what?

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.980
Refugees.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.920
A-Ah, where is Father Mozgus?

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.310
I will come with you.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.670
I was just on my way to the chapel to call him.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.250
Did we shock you?

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.510
Er, no...

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:39.230
All of us have been persecuted because of our appearances.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.030
Exiled from villages and towns,

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.050
we were reviled as monsters.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.550
Some even lived in hiding, in the forests.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.240
Please look.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.580
I was born with a rare disease.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.050
Without this mask, I'd be burned all over my body.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.380
I wouldn't even look human anymore...

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:15.200
God, I thank you for bringing us here today in a fateful act.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.390
Child of fate, find pride and faith within yourself.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.290
I do not like my work.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.960
I cannot find it within myself to enjoy hurting others.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.900
But still, I am proud.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.550
For this is a holy task given to me by God.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.650
What is this sound?

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.910
It is the sound of my master's worship.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.480
Prostration.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.190
Eh?

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.300
Every day, morning and evening,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.430
Father Mozgus prostrates himself before God a thousand times.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.680
In the past decade, he hasn't failed to do so even once.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.950
He seems to be finished.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.860
Well met, Lady Farnese.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.620
Father Mozgus, you're bleeding... Ah, excuse me.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.490
This tower is a most sacred place.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.140
A holy man, imprisoned here by the conqueror Gaiseric,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.150
continued to recount the king's sins to God, even while being tortured.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:35.010
Eventually, in response to his pleas, an angel is said to have descended.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.240
I cannot help but be more devout in my worship here.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.660
Thank you.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.280
Because of these wounds, I can barely walk.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.380
I can run no longer.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.150
But I am fond of this agony.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.710
My holy mission is to enforce God's stern law.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.160
Regrettably, that means causing agony to many.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.270
These wounds are admonitions to me,

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.670
as well as proof of my faith.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.560
Are you having some kind of doubts?

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.030
I am simply unsure.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.050
Will this mission allow us to save people?

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.280
The common people bear us only ill will.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.380
And though it shames me to admit,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.070
even some among my Holy Iron Chain Knights oppose this mission.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.350
Please dismiss this as a mere initiate's ramblings.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.800
But I fear that continuing this way will mean that terror spreads unchecked,

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.570
exhausting the people's hearts and minds.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.910
You must not deplore difficult tasks.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.230
You must not question God.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.020
Though you may endure bloodshed, in both mind and body,

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.990
you must continue to live for God's glory.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.720
That is faith.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:03.470
It is for God, and God alone, that we act.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.740
For God.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.770
And God alone...

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.740
For God alone!

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.080
Thank you for always doing this...

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.630
Don't strain yourself, ma'am.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.460
Hey, Elaine!

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.940
Come on, you can't get yourself all muddy like this.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.470
N-Nina...

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.010
Joachim...

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.730
U-Um... Don't you know what's happening to me?

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.230
U-Um...

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.690
Or are you saying you still want my services, even though you know,

00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:59.990
Customer?

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.740
I'm just worried about you...

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.580
Don't you get it?

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.180
I'm telling you that I can't lie with you, even if you're nice to me!

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.650
Oh, but that's not what I meant—

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.000
Then try to screw me!

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.690
Oh, no. I...

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.920
If you think you're that brave,

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.500
come to the riverbank tonight, when the midnight bell tolls.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.800
What's going on, Nina?

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.610
Why all the racket so early in the morning?

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.440
It's nothing!

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.830
Do you love me?

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.250
Y-Yeah.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.930
Then, are you willing to be damned to Hell with me?

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.480
Y-Yeah.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.680
If it's with you.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.490
This isn't for work.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.310
That girl. Could she be...

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.330
Come, let's go down.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.090
I knew it. That girl...

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.090
This makes you hallucinate...

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.010
Now, let's run away together.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.530
The goddess of flames!

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.170
Nina!

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.040
Come, Joachim.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.300
Oh, Great Goat,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.070
please convert this man.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.310
Now, drink this, and become one of us.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.240
Joachim!

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:30.520
Wa—

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.490
Kill him!

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.160
He'll expose us!

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.470
He can't have survived from this height.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.170
Yeah, let's go home for now.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.850
People might come because of the commotion.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.480
Yeah, right... Liar...

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.520
Nina...

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.030
Luca, why are you here?

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.020
No, stay away...

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.770
Stay away.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.270
Stay away from me!

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.980
Why... Why are you looking at me like that?

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:32.140
I've always hated you!

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.390
Always acting like a know-it-all, ordering us around!

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.970
I bet you feel good about yourself, don't you?!

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.810
You're a whore, just like me!

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.470
But how?

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.730
How can you look down on others like that?

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.200
I-If I scream, my people will come back.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.990
You'll be torn apart!

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:03.620
Wh-What are you—

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.170
Stop!

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.010
Stop...

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.120
Sorry!

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.580
I'm sorry!

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.310
I'm so sorry...

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.680
You worried me.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:33.660
You stupid girl... Luca, I... Joachim...

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.570
Don't talk right now.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.620
Who's this?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.620
Hey, she's a whore with Nina.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.810
Oh, right, the crazy one who's sick.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:45.920
Interesting.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.750
Elai—

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:51.880
That girl.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.510
Hey, show us your rotting face!

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.190
Huh?

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.280
What?

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.550
What's going on?

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:02.510
She's a real beauty, once you look under the bandages.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.490
Yeah, struggle!

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.850
It's more fun when they fight!

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.650
What's with her?

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.650
Hey, you guys!

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:18.660
Luca...

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.150
Huh?

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.840
What?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.290
Hey, what's wrong?

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.130
Starving!

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.570
Wh-What's going on here?

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.750
Meat!

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.090
Meat!

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.430
Elaine!

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.860
Elaine, you...

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.860
A witch... She's a witch.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.390
Light the fire!

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.630
She's sure into this whole thing...

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.850
I heard the commander's family home

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.550
was right at a burning ground for heretics.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:05.220
Since she was a young girl, she's willingly lit fires.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.900
I heard she was allowed to search for the Black Swordsman

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.680
because three years ago, she caught heretics plotting to rebel against

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.460
the Holy See and burned them all at the stake.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.680
So she's born and bred that way, huh?

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.670
I should stay away from her.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.650
You, there!

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.290
No small talk!

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.090
Yes, sir!

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.640
Dad...

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.710
Brat, you're a heretic, too, aren't you?

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.680
The son of a heretic is also a heretic.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.590
If not, throw this onto the pyre.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.610
I... I...

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.320
That child is innocent.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.150
We investigated him when we questioned the father.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.060
M-My apologies!

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:47.950
Oh?

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.210
I'm not trying to obligate you to me.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.130
Hey!

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.720
Lord Jerome, I believe...

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.190
Oh, you aren't the officer of arms for nothing. Good memory...

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.730
You're not so bad, huh?

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:16.480
Hmm?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.270
That kid back there.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.070
That was nice knightly behavior.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.530
Oh, that.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.490
You see, it's personal for me.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.490
I was just like him.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:32.430
My mother was also burned at the stake as a heretic.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.870
Three years ago, before my very eyes.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.350
Three years ago?

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.480
Good work, miss!

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.330
Bless her.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.360
God bless her.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.910
I'm not wrong!

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.500
Shit!

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.380
That monster never gets tired...

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.160
I've finally caught up!

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.940
Casca...

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:01.390

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.420
Giving up before the job's done? No, thanks.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.510
We have come to welcome you, Lady Priestess.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.470
I kind of have the advantage here, you know?

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.470
Go crush them!

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.480
You call this a holy land?
