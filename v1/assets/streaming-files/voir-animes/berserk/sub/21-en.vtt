00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.240
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.160
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.040
At least it is true...

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.170
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.420
G-Guts?

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.590
Commander Guts?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.260
Is it really you, Commander Guts?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.220
Commander Guts!

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.130
Feel no shame about shape.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080
Weather changes their phrase.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.810
Even mother will show you another way.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.210
So put your glasses on.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.280
Nothing will be wrong.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.480
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.320
It's up to you.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.980
The first words should be found.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.590
Whatever holds you back.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.260
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.100
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.200
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.170
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.970
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.210
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.840
It's too late.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.830
Confession

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.220
Guts...

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.640
Guts?

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.810
Is it possible?

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.770
The legendary commander...

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.020
There's no time to waste.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.900
Don't you have a job to do?

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.530
Don't back off!

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.160
Get into battle formation and launch a counterattack!

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.710
Who cares if he killed a hundred men?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.880
Their numbers are small.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.500
Advance! Advance forward!

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.130
Those eyes...

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.790
They haven't changed.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.170
It's no use. We don't stand a chance.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.590
Damn it!

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.470
There's no choice! Retreat!

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.310
Don't let them get away!

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.890
Stop, don't jeopardize yourself!

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.350
But... we can't... Guts!

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.150
What the hell, guys!

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.980
Guts!

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.400
So you survived all this time, Rickert?

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.660
G-Guts...

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.080
Commander!

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.460
Commander Guts!

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.250
I knew it!

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.460
I knew you'd come back someday!

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.010
You guys...

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.180
There's no time to lose!

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.640
The enemy will return.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.680
We must mobilize while it's dark.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.940
Casca... We'll catch up later.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.820
We should get moving now, just like she says.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.960
In this past year, we've been cut down to a fifth of what we were before...

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.000
The Band of the Hawk can no longer be called an army.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.170
Even so, it could be worse...

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.180
Without Casca, there would be nothing left of us at all...

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.350
On that fateful day a year ago...

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.190
We all gathered under Griffith's order.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.570
We hadn't ridden our horses in a while.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.820
And so we waited... But little did we know...

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.000
What's taking Griffith so long?

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.720
Everybody, get down!

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.060
All of a sudden, arrows came pouring down on us like rain.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.190
It was the Midland army... Everything was in chaos...

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.240
We found out only after we had escaped...

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.740
...that Griffith had been captured and arrested for treason.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.230
Griffith?

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.450
A year ago... It was the day after you left.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.160
I can't believe it...

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.370
The Griffith we knew... Why?

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.540
After you left, Guts...

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.250
Griffith was very depressed...

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.880
If you ask me... I think it was because of you that Griffith...

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.300
Don't flatter yourself...

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.810
What happened to Griffith has absolutely nothing to do with you.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.100
Nothing.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.520
But you should have seen how Casca came through!

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.280
She had five serious wounds but still led us till the end of the battle!

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.910
And that was when we welcomed Casca as our leader.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.240
Still, who would've thought...

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.160
...you'd be coming back just when we needed you most?

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.450
It goes to show that our luck hasn't run out yet.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.790
We've been planning an operation, and we're about to carry it out.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.090
An operation?

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.300
We're going to rescue Griffith.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.930
All the guys left here are in dreadful shape.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.690
Their hearts and bodies are covered with wounds...

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.150
But not one of them will even consider leaving us...

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.230
...even though no one's told them they have to stay.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.990
All we have is courage and willpower... but in the end what can that do?

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.410
The ones who are left are Band of the Hawk members down to the bone...

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.660
It's not Griffith we are rescuing...

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.750
It's the Band of the Hawk that wouldn't exist without him.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.380
It's good to be back...

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.010
Some things never change.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.930
We're counting on you... ...Commander Guts.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.390
You mean ex-Commander.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.770
Corkus!

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.940
That bastard left us when we needed him the most!

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.860
How can any of you say he's one of us?

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.530
Corkus, that's too harsh!

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.650
You're nothing but an outsider now, through and through!

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.360
At least make things right, though... Got it?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.700
Yeah... I hear you.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.540
Guts...

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.670
Take care of... ...Casca.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.590
That fateful day a year ago...

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.510
Casca spent three long days and nights lingering on the brink of death...

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.260
In the throes of nightmares she cried out, over and over...

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.640
...for Griffith...

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.810
...and you.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.610
She's pushing herself more than she'll ever let on...

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.030
So...

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.990
Do something about it, will you?

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.490
The rest of us just aren't up to the task.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.990
Quite impressive...

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.240
There's still life in those eyes of yours.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.710
Don't worry.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.460
I'm avoiding your vitals, so you're not in any mortal danger.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:37.050
The king has ordered me to ensure you live at least another three years.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.850
Youth can be so frightening...

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.900
...or perhaps I should say it's a marvel to behold!

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:57.240
Still, man must live in line with his standing, even a hero as great as you.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.610
But it seems you were quite misguided!

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.290
I've been wondering about this unusual charm you're wearing.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.330
But if it has no power to protect you, it's utterly useless!

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.240
Come with me. I want to talk to you.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.460
What do you want?

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.080
Take your stance!

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.180
Hey, wait!

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.510
I said wait!

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.270
What the hell?

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.360
Hey, cut it out!

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.360
Don't patronize me!
Draw your sword!

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.700
What the hell's wrong with you?

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.660
We haven't seen each other in a year, damn it...

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.410
...and the first thing you do is attack me?

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.340
Why the hell did you come back now?

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.170
It's your fault!

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.920
You destroyed everything!

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.010
It's all your fault!

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:45.890
My fault?

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.470
That's right... Griffith and... The Band of the Hawk...

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.930
Everything...

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.890
It all went to hell because of you!

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.850
I did this?
How?

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.690
Because you left us...

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.070
Because you left Griffith!

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.570
No, that can't be right.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.990
It's Griffith... The Griffith we both know...

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.830
What I did wouldn't be enough to bring Griffith down.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.420
There's no way, don't you see?

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.300
Really... You're just a hopeless fool... ...aren't you?

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.970
I told you this once before!

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.390
Those striving to achieve greatness...

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.060
...must also carry a burden greater than anyone else.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.730
Griffith...

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.350
...had to become stronger than the rest.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:38.730
But...

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.070
Griffith is not a god...

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.070
Ideals and dreams alone aren't enough to satisfy a man's heart.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.160
It was you who came along and made Griffith weak!

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.830
Griffith can't go on without you!

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.090
Impossible...

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.300
You could've dodged that attack easily...

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.720
What was I supposed to do?

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.060
L-Let go.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.900
I did what I had to do, just like Griffith.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.860
That's enough. Let go.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.860
All I did was what needed to be done.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.950
How else was I supposed to handle it?

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.240
Let go.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.330
All right, just let go!

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.550
I know.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.970
I understand.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.050
The truth is...

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.010
...you're right.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.350
But I can't take it...

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.980
I can't bear it...

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:06.190
If only I could change the way my heart feels, it'd be so much easier...

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.820
I'm not stupid...

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.660
I know that the quickest path...

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.830
...to the throne of Midland is by marrying Princess Charlotte.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.160
I knew that all along.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.000
And I knew that if it was up to Griffith, that would be the path he would take.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.840
Somehow, I thought I could handle it.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.260
Even if I couldn't stand by Griffith's side as a woman...

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.350
...I could at least stay near him as his sword...

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.600
That's what I wanted to believe.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.520
But the day you left...

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.190
...it finally became clear to me.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.950
The days that I had spent by Griffith's side were a thing of the past...

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.160
My dream had already ended.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.540
The reason why I've kept us together...

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.210
...even if it's just a phantom hope...

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.760
...is because unless I cling on to them, I may lose my self.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.220
But it doesn't matter now.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.720
I can never be the woman of his life...

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.180
...or something that he treasures.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.560
Preserving the crumbling dream of a man...

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.520
...whom I don't even know is alive or not...

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.480
It's too much... for me...

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.570
I'm so tired...

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.860
You take care of the rest.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.530
Casca?

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.390
Damn it!

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.980
What are you thinking?

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.730
Listen to me!

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.810
Don't go near that cliff again!

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.320
I can't afford to be dragged down with you again!

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.400
Understood?

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.860
Fool.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.320
What?

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.750
You're always getting hurt somewhere...

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.710
Always shedding blood because of me...

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.210
You...

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.590
Fool.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.390
Such a fool.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.700
The day you left... That was when I first realized...

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.120
After Griffith's first defeat at your hand, he was on his knees, devastated...

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.830
But you were the one I couldn't take my eyes off of...

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.500
As you walked away without so much as a backward glance...

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.170
I didn't want to accept those feelings of mine.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.350
Because if I did, everything in my life since the moment I met Griffith...

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.680
...would have all been a lie.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.020
I've always lived true to my heart...

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.230
That was the one thing I could be proud of.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.690
Because that was the gift Griffith gave to me...

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.860
But...

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.160
I can change...

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.460
There just might be a place for me inside this man's soul...

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.670
Instead of only taking...

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.180
I might be able to give something back this time.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.560
Guts...

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.770
Why don't you stay with us?

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.690
We'll rescue Griffith, and then we'll all be together, like before...

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.900
I can't.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.490
I just want to put things back together. That's all.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.910
I'll stay till we rescue Griffith and get the Band of the Hawk back on its feet...

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.910
But that's it...

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.790
I must continue my journey...

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.540
I'm through with drawing my sword for others...

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.750
And I won't hang on to someone else's dream anymore.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.220
From now on, I'm going to fight my own battles.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.150
How noble... I'm very impressed...

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.230
You're just like Griffith!

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.900
Your dream is everything to you!

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.610
Everything's always about you!

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.240
It doesn't matter to you if I'm here or not!

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.660
Hey!

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.950
Just go!

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.000
Go off and end up dead in a ditch somewhere for all I care...

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.830
Go off and die with your precious sword!

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.210
Come with me.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.300
What?

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.840
You heard me... Come with me.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.430
I don't know what the future will bring...

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.850
All I know is that I haven't held you long enough yet.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.140
Fool!

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.190
I want to make love to you a hundred...

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.610
No, a thousand times more...

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.690
That's how I feel right now.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.530
You fool.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.820
What the...

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.310
If it weren't for my arm, I could have gone with you guys.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.610
Don't be disappointed.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.860
You'll be the first one to get a hug from Griffith when he comes back.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.280
I'm counting on you, Guts.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.410
Promise you'll bring him back safe.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.580
Yeah.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.370
On your horses!

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.420
We're splitting up into two units, and we'll be taking separate action.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.630
Griffith's rescue unit shall now set off!

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.260
Let's go, boss!

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.520
Rescue unit... Depart for Midland!

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.880
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:07.520
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:11.560
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.530
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.790
What is that?

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.060
It's just the same.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.230
What is trying your crown?

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.410
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.740
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.450
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.120
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.400
Next Episode

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.110
As they wander through the never-ending darkness...

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.030
The last remaining flame is lit...

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.080
...in each of the souls who gather here now.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.790
Do you believe?

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.580
Do you hate?

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.420
Do you love?

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:29.220
When will mankind awaken to the true sorrow of loss?

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.430
