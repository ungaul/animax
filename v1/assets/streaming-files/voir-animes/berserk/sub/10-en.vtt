WEBVTT

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.330
Show yourself!

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.580
Huh?

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.750
What's happening?

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.290
Go back.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.620
This is my garden.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.100
The living should go back where they belong.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.390
That appearance...

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.650
Hell's Angels

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.000
What is this?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.590
An idol.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.200
An idol made of the skin and bones of priests.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.390
Wh-Who is that?

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.520
Who are you?

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.720
I am no one.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.440
I have never been anyone,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.830
and I was buried without ever being known to anyone.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.760
I never knew who I was,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.250
nor was there anyone to teach me.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.850
There was nowhere I belonged in this world.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.360
No one needed me, and no one knew me.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.600
I came to scavenge garbage by night.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.830
And by day, I hid silently in a pit.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.870
After a very long time had passed,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.130
my home became a grave for the people who lived above.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.810
I was buried...

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.160
Crushed by corpses at the bottom of the pit.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.470
No one knew of it.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.670
But as my consciousness faded, I met them.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.570
I met the five angels.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.070
Angels?

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.530
The angels taught me about the world.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.390
And then, I knew.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.190
The world was full of despair.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.530
And I was to perish and disappear at its nadir, as no one.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.080
I screamed...

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.290
A scream between a dying cry and a birth cry.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.220
The angels answered that call.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.770
They said they would grant my wish.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.940
Wish?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.190
Indeed... To hatch the perfect world.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.740
You're an egg...

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.690
Yes, I am an egg.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.200
The egg of the perfect world.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.810
My wish is that world's wish.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.210
I have been chosen as the one who will hatch the new world.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.710
This world is too flawed.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.990
So much unjust death...

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.470
And the agony and terror of the living, attempting to escape this fate.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.980
Order, created to conceal the chaos, yet full of hypocrisy...

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.890
The people, appeased by that twisted order, bringing death to others...

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.170
The world is ugly.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.140
What's your plan?

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.710
Are you planning revenge on the townspeople?

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.500
It is not revenge.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.860
It is salvation.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.070
For those who are ugly, cowardly, unscrupulous, fearful.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.130
Clinging to what they hate.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.270
We truly desire only one thing.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.220
It is the first, and the last, fragment this world lacks.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.700
In other words, God!

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.290
H-He's fighting them.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.820
Fighting those monsters as an equal or more.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.940
Of course!

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.490
He's the man I have high expectations for!

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.260
Train long and hard as my disciple, and you will also be proficient.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.980
What is... What is this?

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.520
That man...

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.940
Whenever the Black Swordsman appears, it breaks apart.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.400
The world I know shatters, with a deafening roar.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.340
Luca, I'm scared!

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.500
That's right...

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.440
Now that the veil of faith has burned away,

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.860
only children, terrified of the dark, are lit in the gloom...

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.660
Let go of me!

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.650
Let me go... Do you have a death wish?

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.560
Y-You're the one who's gonna die!

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.570
What? What? What happened?

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.560
His manhood's been shattered!

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.030
All right, then...

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.190
Please hold back, master.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.710
This is our job.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.200
Father Mozgus, please fulfill your own sacred task.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.780
Ah, forgive me.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.580
I have allowed myself to lose composure.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.590
I leave our master's protection to you.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.470
Let us go!

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.590
Casca!

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.030
Like hell you will!

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.600
Oh, fine... Isidoro Punch!

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.350
Elven Lethal Head-Strike!

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.230
Huh?

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.620
God?

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.120
But i-it can't be.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.620
It is true.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.950
Everything is moving in a current toward that point in time.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.290
Your guiding that witch to this land

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.630
is but another sign.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.640
As for that Black Swordsman...

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.130
He's... He's involved, too?

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.150
Vessels for the one they wish to bring into the world through the advent.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.100
Who is it?

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.940
Who do they so strongly desire?

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.050
That one will soon appear.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.240
When the countless souls,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.440
who have been trodden like dirt, desire it with greater fervor.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.080
In exchange for my insignificant self, who barely...

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.020
nay, never even existed in this world,

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.390
a new world will emerge.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.560
Why?

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.420
Why did you bring me here?

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.550
Why are you telling me this?

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.530
It could have been anyone.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.770
I just wanted to talk to someone...

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.220
before I disappeared...

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.270
It still had such power?

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.490
Death, are you... No, who are you people?

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.110
That is of no concern to those of the mortal realm.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.880
It is best you not get too involved.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.650
Of course, depending on what happens next,

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.020
the very principles of the world may change.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.190
Hey, what the...

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.800
Ow!

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.780
Thanks, yet again... No, it is too soon to thank me.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.480
It's futile.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.480
If you continue to resist,

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.980
you'll lose the lone eye you have left.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.660
Casca!

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.710
Hey, wait!

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.670
Time out! Hey!

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.010
I now sentence you to the breaking wheel

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.430
for plotting to kill a priest.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.940
H-Hey!

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.440
This is the end.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.030
I can't dodge it.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.280
I can't dodge it...

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.270
Fine.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.890
A cannon?

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.960
He had a dangerous weapon like that I'm so done...

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.720
in his false hand?

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.580
One...

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:28.970
Two.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:30.770
Three.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.290
Thank you, God.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.920
For preparing such a miracle for us here, at our end,

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.750
after having suffered merciless fates due to our abhorrent forms.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.480
And above all,

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.680
thank you for the miracle... of our paths crossing

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.020
with Father Mozgus...

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.260
Shit... Not again.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.800
Oh.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.780
H-Hey, wait...

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.210
Crap! Commander, when did you arrive?

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.220
E-Earthquake?

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.180
Those are the monsters from the tower.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.480
They are a whorl of the hatred festering here.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.990
They responded to the aberration in the tower.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.920
But I did not expect they would take form, even without a gate,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.750
just by having the branded assemble here.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.330
Gate?

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.840
It is nearly time.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.260
They noticed us!

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.360
It begins...

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.510
Reporting in!

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.000
We've captured dozens of heretics

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.240
attempting to escape from the dungeons!

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.670
They are terrified, rambling about monsters,

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.240
but nothing coherent.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.420
Any word on Lady Farnese's whereabouts?

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.250
No, sir. We have been unable to confirm her location.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.250
Sir Azan, what is the meaning of this?

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.650
Should anything happen to Lady Farnese,

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.510
who will take responsibility?

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.460
Why is this happening?

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.600
I fled from the holy city's burdens

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.520
to spend the rest of my days peacefully in this remote region...

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.030
What is going on?

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.250
Monsters!

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.850
We're in danger... All men, retreat!

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.940
Get away from the tower!

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.110
This is seriously bad news!

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.340
My God.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.100
Look!

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.620
Luca... Wait, Pepe!

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.900
Even if you went, what could you possibly do?

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.450
But... Shh! Quiet!

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:05.870
I hear something.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.840
The wind?

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.920
No, it's coming from the refugee camp.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.630
Are those... screams?

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:13.880
Dad!

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.130
Honey...

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.500
Mom, Dad's...

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.640
Mom?

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.340
Heretics!

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.430
Run!

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.540
Go to Albion!

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:48.530
Shit... What the hell's going on?

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.780
All troops, get as far from the tower as possible!

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.940
Any who can are to help the injured!

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.940
Oh, God!

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.580
Lady Farnese... Vice-commander!

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.780
Have mercy!

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.410
Help!

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:43.870
Vice-commander!

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.730
God's breath!

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.470
That's...

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.730
Father Mozgus... An angel! He's an angel!

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.740
Servants of God, you have naught to fear!

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:08.260
No matter what extraordinary powers the heretics may bring to bear,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.510
as long as your faith is pure, God will

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.760
manifest a miracle to defeat the Hawk's power.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.210
See me as I now am!

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.830
This is God's power incarnate.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:28.020
These wings will purify evil and destroy demons!

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.640
I will now burn this witch at the stake, for she is the origin

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.670
of all the evil now rife in this holy land.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.790
I will put an end to these loathsome abominations.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.990
Casca!

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.530
Now!

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:06.810
While we keep these monstrosities at bay, erect the pillar!

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.500
Vice-commander, what should we do?

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.280
There is no question!

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.980
Knights have but one duty.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.730
All troops, charge!

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.080
Protect the people!

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.820
That bald rock-face... He treats people like dirt.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.550
Forget him. I wonder if Guts and the rest are okay.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.830
Four angels...

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.410
So that's what it means!

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.060
Unfortunately, no man possesses the means to change this festival's outcome.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.380
A shadow will be born.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:36.150
It will simply be a shadow cast by a dying sun that shines on a faraway land.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.480
A shadow?

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.020
Come to think of it,

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.400
even being so close, my brand isn't searing me with pain.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.830
Do not have more than one that you care for.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.680
At a time like this... What am I doing?

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.220
Hurry up!

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.400
Burn her!

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.180
We'll be saved if we burn her!

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:21.110
Out of the way!

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:01.460

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.460
Everything is following the same path as before...

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.550
Will it end the same way?

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.510
Mark this well, monkey child!!

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.510
I have to go.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520
Come, mighty strength!! Come, superhuman strength!!
