00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.650
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law?

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.610
Is it like the hand of God hovering above?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.490
At least it is true...

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.540
...that man has no control, even over his own will.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.380
Can't we go any faster?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.340
No.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.760
Any faster and it'll be too hard on Griffith.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.930
They're catching up.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.500
Feel no shame about shape.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.450
Weather changes their phrase.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.180
Even mother will show you another way.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.580
So put your glasses on.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.650
Nothing will be wrong.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.850
There's no blame. There's no fame.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.690
It's up to you.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.350
The first words should be found.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.960
Whatever holds you back.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.630
I... ...can... I can get it off.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.470
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you want.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.570
I don't know why... Don't know why...

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.540
Don't know why you're afraid.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.340
Tell me what... Tell me what... Tell me what you'd say.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.580
I don't know why... Don't know why... Too late...

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.210
It's too late.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.050
Eve of the Feast

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.720
First unit, continue pursuit!

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.310
Second unit, follow my lead!

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.310
To the valley!

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.950
At this rate, they'll catch up with us any second!

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.030
We have no choice!

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.240
Should we attack?

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.950
No, we'll make it!

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.710
We thought we'd welcome you with bows and arrows.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.680
I'm counting on you to look after Griffith.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.800
We'll take good care of him, big sister.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.640
We're going to annihilate our pursuers here, once and for all!

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.640
Bastards!

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.810
Charge!

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.200
What happened?

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.590
Stop right there!

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.350
Bastard!

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.430
Don't move.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.640
Now slowly put your weapons down and surrender!

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.400
I'm sure you thought you could revive your group with this man's return, but...

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.780
Stop it!

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.860
Behold!

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.370
This man will never fight again!

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.670
He will never ride a horse, nor hold a sword again...

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.790
He can't even stand on his own two feet!

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.670
You've made a grave mistake.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.600
There is not a single shred of hope left for any of you.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.250
Hey, it's not true, is it?

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.960
What that bastard said was a load of bullshit, right?

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.260
Screw you, guys! I'll ask him myself.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.670
You can't do that.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.970
What do you mean?

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.930
Griffith can't give you an answer.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.220
You've got to be kidding.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.640
So his throat got a little dry living in prison?

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.690
And that's why...

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.700
What the hell!

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.290
This is supposed to be our new beginning!

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.170
We were going to make a fresh start after we rescued Griffith, right?

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.380
For a year we've lived like squirming bugs, losing half our men...

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.600
But after believing for so long that all we had to do was get Griffith back...

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.220
This is what we get?

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.020
You know, I had a feeling it would turn out like this, seriously...

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.280
But...

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.400
But even so...

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.290
What are we going to do?

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.050
What on earth are we going to do now?

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.220
It's not like we've been totally wiped out.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.930
And we have you, Casca...

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.180
There's no Band of the Hawk without Griffith.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.900
You all should know that.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.770
Yeah, but if that's the...

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.230
Casca's pushed herself harder than anyone else.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.150
So stop making unreasonable demands.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.320
Yeah, but...

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.910
What about us...

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120
Please give me...

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.040
...some time.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.080
We still have time until the others join us.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.130
Let me think this over until then.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.640
Hey, wait up!

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.100
What is there to think over?

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.520
What are you planning?

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.100
You're not thinking of continuing...

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.480
What were you... ...about to say back there?

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.740
That if it's a battle of your own choosing...

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.400
...then you'd better settle it yourself.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.200
That shows... how strong you are.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.450
Because for us, even if we started something, we can't always finish it.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.590
Can you really look Griffith in the eye now and say that?

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.720
We're all weak.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.260
So we cling to others and to dreams...

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.520
We cling to kind words of comfort... and even to harsh words of rebuke.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.820
All I've wanted was someone to cling to... To be by my side.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.000
I'll go check on Griffith.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.340
Griffith, let's change your bandages.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.010
Whether it's a good dream or a bad dream...

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.480
No one feels good when woken up in the middle of one...

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.560
So are you going back to traveling and perfecting your combat skills?

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.610
I guess. And you?

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.650
Well...

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.240
Perhaps I'll bring along the guys that are left and form a band of thieves.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.080
That way, I'm sure we can at least take care of Griffith...

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.200
I'll come too.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.080
You already left us once, remember?

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.920
You have no obligation to stick with us any longer.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.830
But...

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.630
...you do?

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.380
Sure, I'm still one of the Band of the Hawk.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.220
But you're different.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.810
You've already begun fighting your own battles.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.180
Leave behind those who can no longer stand up.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.060
That's the law of the battlefield, isn't it?

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.060
But that aside...

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.320
You better be sure to take Casca with you this time.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.110
She's too much of a straight arrow to be leading a pack of thieves.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.030
A thief with a conscience? No thanks... Not for me!

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.790
I mean it.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.660
Take her with you, even if you have to drag her.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.120
Commander!

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.250
Commander Guts!

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.250
Hey, are you planning to leave us again without saying a word?

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.550
If you go, please let us go with you!

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.180
We've all talked it over and agree...

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.890
Not one of us wishes otherwise.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.220
You guys...

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.890
As long as you're there...

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.640
We'll make it through, somehow.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.390
Commander!

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.100
Please take us with you... Commander...

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.150
Please, Commander...

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.070
Perhaps... ...this has been my home all along.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.950
I didn't realize it until this very moment...

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.290
Everything I wanted back then is right here in front of me now.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.790
Why?

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.510
Why do I never realize what I have until it is lost?

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.690
Griffith's hands...

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.900
I never realized how small they were...

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.160
He tried to grasp everything with these two hands...

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.290
Just by placing this hand on my shoulder...

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.000
...he always made my fears subside...

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.670
He saved me time after time...

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.880
Now I must do the same for him.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.390
Oh...

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.060
Um...

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.680
Um, I...

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.400
Sorry... I'll go get more bandages...

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.570
Griffith, st...

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:27.850
Hey...

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.310
How's Griffith?

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.730
He just fell asleep...

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.650
Something wrong?

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.770
No, nothing's wrong...

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.690
What the hell's going on?

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.860
No, really, it's nothing!

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.910
So you're crying over nothing?

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.740
Did something happen to Griffith?

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.830
No, stop!

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.000
It's not that!

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.120
Hey...

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.960
I'm sorry...

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.960
I can't go... What?

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.510
I-I can't go with you...

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.890
Griffith... ...he's so small...

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.060
...and he's trembling so much...

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.020
When he used to be so proud and dignified...

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.480
I can't leave him behind...

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.480
I can't leave him like that...

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.740
I'm sorry...

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.740
I'll stay...

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.410
...as well.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.080
You're through clinging to other people's dreams...

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.290
You have your own battles to fight, remember?

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.290
You have to go...

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.250
If you're Griffith's true friend...

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:44.800
...you have to leave.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.640
Even without me, you have to go.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.620
Why are you trembling with fear in a place like this?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.400
Let's go...

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.860
I still want to play some more!

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.910
The sun hasn't set yet.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.510
Griffith!

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.270
But how?

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.600
Did he hear us?

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:21.730
I'll go after him!

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.690
Go tell the others!

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.880
I've rested too long...

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.880
It's time to go...

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.130
It's not over yet...

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.180
As long as that cobblestone path keeps leading me on...

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:03.980
Griffith...

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:05.690
Griffith...

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.780
Supper's ready.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.820
Oh, were you asleep?

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.990
Sorry...

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.700
...but we need to get some air in here...

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.200
Where am I?

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.240
What?

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.620
Is there something on my face?

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.870
You were dreaming about the old days again, weren't you?

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.540
A dream...

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.550
I see. That's all it was.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.880
It's been a while since any of the guys came by to see us.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.550
I wonder what they're all up to?

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.850
I wonder if that guy's still waving his big sword around somewhere?

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:48.060
The past feels like nothing more than a dream now.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.190
Hey! Guts!

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.690
Leave Pippin alone!

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.280
Go wash your hands!

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.740
Yes, Mother!

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.870
Many things happened...

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.080
But they're all just distant memories now.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.920
I think I'm much more suited to this lifestyle...

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.290
My life with you and our boy, just the three of us...

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:18.340
This kind of peaceful life is not so bad.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:48.350
It's called a behelit, the Egg of the King.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.560
The owner of this necklace is destined to hold...

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.570
...the world in his hands, in exchange for his flesh and blood.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.360
In exchange for his flesh and blood?

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.490
Griffith... ...was it really me who drove you to this?

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.750
Am I responsible for what has become of you?

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.500
What should I do?

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.880
What do you want me to do?

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.210
What can I do for you now?

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.840
What's that?

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.220
What the...

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:26.890
A solar eclipse...

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.150
Griffith!

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.090
Stay away!

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.130
Guts!

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.110
What the hell is that?

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.030
Soldiers?

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.450
Can it be the Midland army?

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.120
I don't know...

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.710
I don't know what it is... But it's ominous...

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.630
Griffith!

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.460
Don't come near me!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.460
Griffith!

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:41.590
Don't come near me!

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.930
If you touch me now...

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.010
If you grasp my shoulder now...

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.770
I'll never again...

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.480
I'll never again... you.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.150
Griffith.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.150
Looking back, the morning comes.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.790
Don't find your face in your glass.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.830
Take the moonlight by the tail.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.800
It's a rainy sight. You're shading.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.060
What is that?

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.330
It's just the same.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.500
What is trying your crown?

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.680
I'm spending my glass, walking back.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.010
So wear my glass. You're fading.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.720
I'm waiting so long.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.390
I'm waiting...

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.490
Next Episode

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.110
Their final destination is darkness...

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.160
And it is despair that awaits them.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.450
They are engulfed.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:22.120
By betrayal... Confusion... Tears... Woe...

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:27.250
Solitude... And all that shall be left in the end...

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.630
...is the purest of dreams.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.510
The Great Eclipse
