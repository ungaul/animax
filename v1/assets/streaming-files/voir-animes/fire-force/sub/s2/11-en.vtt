00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.150
"Prologue: The Great Cataclysm"

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.216
A long time ago, mankind was touched by the planet's anger,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.056
and the world was engulfed in flames.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.806
It was the Day of the Cataclysm.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.476
The flames burned ferociously,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.016
with an intensity threatening to incinerate the places mankind lived in,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.436
the languages they spoke, and the culture they had built up.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.220
"Chapter One: Holy Fire"

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.366
As the world was being covered in ash, one man appeared.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.616
He would later be called Raffles I.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.416
Raffles took his disciples and left on a journey in search of light.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.586
At the end of his journey, he found an "unsullied flame,"

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.610
and brought forth the light that would be mankind's salvation.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.580
"Chapter Two: Amaterasu"

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.936
Raffles and his disciples used the flame bestowed by the great Sol

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.646
and the technology cultivated by mankind to create "Amaterasu."

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.486
The sacred flame of Amaterasu benefited the lives of mankind,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.220
and ended up establishing the foundation of a state in the Far East.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.336
During the investigation we just carried out,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.916
we discovered a facility called the Tabernacle, that is similar to Amaterasu,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.950
and determined that its power source was a person bearing an Adolla Burst.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.066
In addition... and this is still speculation...

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.986
The source of power for the empire's Amaterasu is also a person.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.026
Probably the girl that I Linked with at the 4th,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.600
whom we suspect to be the First Pillar.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.980
But then, what is written in the scriptures of the Holy Sol Temple is...

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.046
It means that the Holy Sol Temple's scriptures

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.450
would be presenting teachings that are incorrect.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.846
Every citizen of the empire knows what's in the scriptures.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.636
Are you telling me they're false?

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.136
Of course they are!

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.290
They don't say anywhere that our family were the ones who built Amaterasu!

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.486
But to think that there's a person inside Amaterasu...

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.680
What were my ancestors involved in?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.406
False teachings... Does that mean that it's possible

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.350
the Evangelist and the Holy Sol Temple are connected?

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.426
Shinra, Arthur, Tamaki, excellent work on this mission.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.676
I'm going to report the results of your investigation to the top brass at once.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.016
Lieutenant?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.210
This concludes today's meeting. All personnel, return to your normal duties.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.446
Iris, are you okay?

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.446
Just thinking that this country is built on one person's sacrifice...

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.036
It's hard for us to believe, as Holy Sol adherents, isn't it?

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.496
Captain, is the Holy Sol Temple evil?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.786
I can't say for sure.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.876
But the fact that the Holy Sol Temple supports the people is true.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.910
I am grateful for Sol's grace.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.450
Thank you very much.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.000
I have to find the truth, for the sake of the sister and other devout believers.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.146
No doubt about it. Arthur-kun was right.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.640
The sequence of numbers inside the Tabernacle is pi!

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.890
But what does pi have to do with Amaterasu?

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.016
The Holy Sol Temple's scriptures are flat-out false.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.920
And the development of the country has been nothing more than a put-up job.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.066
But if the people of the empire learn of our suspicions about Amaterasu...

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.906
If the results of this investigation ever come to light,

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.776
it would rock the whole Tokyo Empire.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.036
I know. We have to be very careful about how we treat this information.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.036
Unfortunately, I doubt this country would change.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.650
The story would just get hushed up, and that would be the end of it.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.280
I guess this is all the Fire Force can do.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It might be time to play it a little rougher.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.650
That's a dangerous idea, isn't it? Paying a visit to the Holy Sol Temple?

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.586
Sounds intriguing, right?

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.660
You're not exactly on the straight and narrow. Who are you?

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.960
A dark hero.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.286
Everything I've had, I've lost,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.576
but I won't let go of this remaining spark

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.166
No, I won't let it go, not ever

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:49.756
Though there may be no right answers in my ill-defined tale,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.926
once I'm able to step forward...

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:59.596
They say something's wrong with me, but I'll do something with them

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.556
I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.186
But if my dreams have resolved themselves to be by your side

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:15.236
then there's nothing left for me to doubt anymore

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.076
Sparks fly as things kick off

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.906
until "black and white" turns to ashen gray

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.826
If there's a choice crown to be had

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:28.706
I want it, I want it I'll whizz my way toward you

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.626
until "double or nothing" gets zeroed out

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.426
If the clowns are melancholy

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.256
then nothing will get anywhere

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.596
I'll show you a love that burns hot enough to scorch ashes

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.250
I just spark again

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.970
"Episode 11: Dark Hero"

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:05.456
The Holy Sol Temple is hiding something. Don't you find that shady?

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.690
You're just as shady, yourself.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.630
All the same, this does sound interesting.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.946
So, why me?

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.496
As proto-nationalists,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.876
you all have been unfairly oppressed by the Holy Sol Temple.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.530
I doubt you've forgotten that fact, right?

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.676
Or now that you're an imperial Fire Soldier,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.750
have you lowered yourself to being one of their dogs?

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.946
Please do not give money to solicitors.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.366
This is Armed Forces Security Enforcement.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.270
What is right and what is wrong?

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.940
I just want to know the right answers.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.990
The vague scraps presented by God aren't enough.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.516
Only the right answers are the singular truths that transcend God.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.886
I want to know the cause of human combustion,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.500
and what exactly is happening in the world.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.300
"Several years earlier" "Haijima Industries, Headquarters"

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:10.250
"Infernal" "human combustion" "Adolla Burst" "Great Cataclysm"

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:17.836
Licht-kun, I read your paper on human combustion. It was really good.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.530
How did you come up with the idea behind your theory?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.670
H-Hey, Licht-kun!

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.500
I'm just...

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.920
...trying to find the right answer.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.600
The right answer is the one thing in this world that I can trust.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:57.796
Is that your just cause, Viktor Licht?

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.756
You again?

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:05.280
I seek the truth; I have no need for anything as ill-defined as just causes.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.790
Heroes need them.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.386
We can't go public? Why not, sir?!

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.546
No, I wouldn't think so.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:53.266
The facts that you uncovered are likely to disturb the empire's citizens.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.476
Apparently, things must be done in order for everything to be disclosed.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.106
Disturbed? You're kidding.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.026
Much as I hate it, this was the top brass's decision.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.986
We'll have to wait for three years while this goes through the church,

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.786
to allow them to reveal the truth in a way that won't cause any chaos.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.406
Th-Three whole years?

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.536
So we have to keep on deceiving the empire's people during that time?

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.876
If that's the case, I don't understand why we even went to investigate!

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:26.586
...Not to mention what the White-Clad will do in the meantime... ...It's not unusual for the truth to be hidden to preserve the status quo.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.886
The "imperial dogs" aren't up to this.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:34.290
This calls for a stray dog that isn't chained up to anything!

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.236
Waka! Waka!

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.236
Hey, have you seen Waka around?

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.576
Huh? You, too, Lieutenant Konro? We were just looking for him, as well.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.156
For crying out loud, where could he be out whooping it up at this hour?

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.586
Well, he's bound to get hungry and come back home before breakfast.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.796
Whenever you do see Waka, come let me know.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.070
Yes, sir.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:16.250
Oh, Beni, here I thought you were starting to get your act together lately.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.960
Don't go stirring up any trouble.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.736
Is that it?

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.866
As you can see, the approach is exposed and the security is tight.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.560
We won't be able to just sneak on in.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.996
As such, how about we bust our way right through the main entrance?

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.270
Nice and straightforward.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.586
You know, I still can't believe you decided to tag along

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:53.306
with someone as fishy as I am. There's something quite different about you.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.346
Yeah. That's because you are so fishy.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.830
If you try anything funny, I'll have my eye on you, and can just stomp you.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.736
Don't push me, now! We're so high up!

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.420
I'm not pushing you yet.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.366
You're on the empire's wanted list, aren't you?

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.890
Why are you taking a risk like storming the Imperial Seat?

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.360
For my just cause.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:35.256
I want to know the truth! About what's happening in this country, and this world!

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.436
To find out that truth, I'm willing to let my humanity, my ethics,

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.436
my morality, and my virtue be damned!

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.726
I was born and brought up in this land.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.760
I have a right to know the truth about it!

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.986
Truth is the one thing that spells equal justice for all!

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.656
What's in there?

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.416
The "true" scriptures that the Holy Sol Temple has been hiding.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.716
Never heard of them. How do you know about them?

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.950
I happen to know just a little bit about the church.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.056
All right, let's climb down and go pay our respects.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.306
We're climbing down?! Why did we even come up here?!

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:29.880
People expect you to look down on things from above when you're a hero.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:37.680
"Holy Sol Temple, Imperial Seat"

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.116
Our Lord, who shineth in Heaven,

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.206
please bestow thy blessed light upon us.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.480
Látom.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.426
Allow me.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.870
That's okay.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:05.766
Do you know why I devote myself to Sol as much as I do?

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.380
Of course, Excellency.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.746
In times of old, there were many religions that thrived around the world,

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:31.706
and by standing together in their belief in God,

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.586
they established a way of living that maintained discipline.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.596
Now, in recent times, a newly-created science

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:46.596
has allowed mankind to develop more abundantly, and more efficiently.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.766
Before the Great Cataclysm,

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:54.276
there were many forms of religion and government across a vast world.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.066
However, all of them have perished.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:04.996
The Holy Sol Temple is a bundling of all the histories of mankind.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.286
All of the world's diverse religions, governments, and science

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:14.990
became as one, centered around Sol and Amaterasu.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:23.620
The Holy Sol Temple is indeed mankind's final light, the "truth."

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:33.436
No one in this world can be allowed to betray the Holy Sol Temple.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.276
Yes, heretics who follow not after the Holy Sol Temple, which leads to rebirth,

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:43.696
but idolize this Destroyer God, Shinmon.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:50.036
Do the residents of Asakusa still reject the beneficence of Amaterasu?

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.876
We have been advised by the cardinals to avoid doing anything

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.030
that might provoke Benimaru Shinmon.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.646
Benimaru Shinmon... What was that sound?!

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.726
It was close!

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.266
It's the main entrance!

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.920
B-B-Benimaru Shinmon is attacking!

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.100
No, Your Excellency, we have done nothing to him yet!

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.860
Stop that man!

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.260
Why is Benimaru Shinmon here?!

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.680
I'm not Benimaru Shinmon.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.650
I'm Shinmon Benimaru.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:19.666
You really let them have it. F... the Holy Sol Temple! That felt good.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.256
You're the one who told me to do it.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.216
Kicking disciple ass in the house of God...

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.516
What's become of your sense of justice?

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.266
This isn't about anything as significant as "justice."

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:36.106
All I want is for those around me to be able to live happy lives.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.066
I don't know if it's because I'm a proto-nationalist,

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.406
but I just don't like the Holy Sol Temple.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.116
The energy that is produced by Amaterasu

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.826
somehow has the stink of blood on it.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.786
Your senses are sharp, aren't they?

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:56.166
I like how being with you doesn't make me feel tense.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:00.416
These guys may not look it, but they're the elite guard.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.876
The Holy Sol Temple

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.756
boasts that they have God's Holy Fire and the power of science,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.216
and proclaims that mankind is wonderful,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.080
but people are nothing but animals before we ever get to mankind and God.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.146
They say we are a nation blessed by God,

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.840
but if just one animal goes wild, it all falls apart.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.840
I just want to make them understand that.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:34.826
This is no place for a barbarian like you to trespass.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.270
Die.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.610
Hey, what's the matter?

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.670
Hey... Mr. Almighty?

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.590
I have no prayers to offer for you!

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.150
Hey...

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:24.796
"To be continued"

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.320
Lame.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.476
Most incidences have their own name

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.356
But no one knows and I'm upside down

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.156
Billions of people exist

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.826
But not anybody tells me what that is

00:22:52.850 --> 00:23:00.496
Sacrificing my limited life Am I moving forward or not

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:07.626
I just want to believe Nothing goes to waste

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.006
I question myself Why I can't be who I want to be

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:17.636
tangled and translucent It drains me

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.976
Pretending and overextending myself

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.356
Wish one day I could love pathetic myself

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.406
Hoping for a dazzling future to come

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:35.036
Don't over decorate smile clumsily

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:42.456
Just live life the way I am This world is cruel

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.666
Can't choose how to be born

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:50.546
Stick up the middle finger then

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:55.410
Let's shoot off to the other side

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.476
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.540
"Next time"

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.146
Captain Shinmon collapses before the Holy Sol Temple combatant.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.686
Joker is stunned by this.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:11.196
What they seek is an even deeper mystery within the Holy Sol Temple.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.816
I'm not sure how I feel about this.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.656
I, too, love the darkness.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:17.746
"Episode 12: Shadows Cast by Divine Light"

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:24.206
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 12, "Shadows Cast by Divine Light."

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.506
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.530
