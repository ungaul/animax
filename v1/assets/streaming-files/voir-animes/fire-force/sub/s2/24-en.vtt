WEBVTT

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:08.270
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.900
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.740
...is death by fire.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.460
--It's too hot! --It's too hot!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.630
Captain Shinmon! Where did you go?!

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.920
You can't tell us you've forgotten about us!

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.490
"Episode 24: Signs of Upheaval"

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.590
We came here to learn how to use Hysterical Strength of a Fire Scene!

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.720
Captain Shinmon! What is the purpose of this?!

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.180
Captain Shinmon, what is the purpose of that?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.470
I don't know. It's proto-nationalist hazing.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.690
Hysterical Strength of a Fire Scene

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.270
is a power beyond the limits of the limits of one's strength.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.650
So this is also necessary to overcome the limits of the limits of one's strength.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.570
Konro did this to me when I was a kid.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.910
Ah.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.970
It's called Hysterical Strength of a Fire Scene. It's no exaggeration to say

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.220
that when someone can use this Hysterical Strength at will,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.350
they become a full-fledged hikeshi.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.350
And the captain of the 8th? He's God's gift to Hysterical Strength.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.270
That man is the model of what a hikeshi should be.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.030
Captain Obi?

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.360
Nobody else who is unpowered can do the things he can.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.700
Wh-What is the purpose of this?!

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.460
What is... ...the purpose... ...of this?!

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.380
What is... ...the purpose...

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.220
We're roasted over a fire... dragged through town behind a wagon...

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.600
...dipped undressed and upside-down in water... then spun around...

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.140
What is... the purpose of this...?

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.850
Hysterical Strength of a Fire Scene

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.150
requires you to go beyond the limit of your limits.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.230
Right...

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.650
I said the same thing when Konro did this to me.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.110
And...?

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.330
I'm sure there was some reason for all of this.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.330
I never actually checked, though.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.120
"Huh..."
Huh...?

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.540
"Seriously?"

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Okay, let's do this.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.920
Was there really no point to all of that, sir?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.260
I don't know. Are you going to worry about every little thing?

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
--Hey, screw you, man! --What the hell was all that?!

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.100
--Die, damn you! --That was complete abuse of power!

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.060
Maybe it's the hazing, but you have a lot of pent-up anger.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.310
Nice. I can feel the breath of life in every one of your attacks.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.190
I can even sense you trying to kill me.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.280
Of course you can, sir! It's the bitterness from our anger!

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.120
Whoa, are you okay?!

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.040
That's going too far!

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.630
Anger begets anger. If you turn your bloodlust on someone,

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.720
that bloodlust is guaranteed to come right back to you.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.930
You two have learned the breath of life. Your lives,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.600
your friends' lives, your enemies' lives... the importance of all life.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.320
But you still take it too lightly.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.070
To face a fire scene

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.830
is to cast yourselves into the purifying fires of the Wisdom King Acala.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.830
The moment you drop your guard will be your last.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.170
Acala's flames will come and snuff your breath of life right out.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.960
What you sense past the breath of life is...

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.470
"The Press of Death"

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.980
Look alive! Or Acala will claim your life.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.440
How?! He's faster than my Rapid!

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.360
That was a simple kick and palm strike...

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.160
This is the Hysterical Strength of a Fire Scene?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.200
--We're not... --...done yet!

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.530
I'm not done yet...!

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.120
D-Damn... They've been at it for five hours.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.880
They've used up all the oxygen in their bodies. They're blacking out.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.540
If they keep this up any longer,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.880
they'll develop tephrosis.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.920
Overheated?

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.600
Captain Shinmon, isn't that enough training for one day?

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.850
Training? I don't remember even starting that.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.270
Get up. The training begins now.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.990
Hey, Konro, are you here?

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.580
Wah! The captain of the 5th?! Are you here to have Waka train you, too?

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.460
Don't be ridiculous. I'm a researcher, not a barbarian.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.210
I've come to hear all about the story you mentioned yesterday,

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.670
about when you fought that demon two years ago.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.760
Hmm? Yesterday? You mean about the doppelganger?

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.970
Yeah, that's right. I want to hear more about it.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.980
You want to hear more? I don't know what to say.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.980
There isn't anything more than what I said yesterday. Anyhow,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.730
why don't you come in?

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.780
I thought as much, so we're here to take it up with you physically.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.610
Please go on in.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.490
There's someone else with you?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.000
Special Fire Force Company 6 Captain Kayoko Huang.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.410
Kayoko-san, this is the one.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.370
I'll start with a palpatory exam.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.170
What are they doing to me?

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.970
What's the matter? Get up, already.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.720
The training is just starting?

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.760
If you keep this up any longer, they're going to get tephrosis!

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.810
This training is to push them beyond their limits.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.100
Now, stand up!

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:14.820
I was... never going... to quit...

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.620
...in the... first place...

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.370
That just sounds like bravado to me.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.590
Just standing there getting hit is the same as quitting.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.180
Come on, what's wrong with you? Move, or you're dead.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.390
Your enemy isn't going to wait for you.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.020
I know that... sir...

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.210
All the oxygen in my body... I can't breathe...

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.380
I can feel my own life burning...

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.630
My consciousness...

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.130
...is fading...

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.970
A fire scene...?

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.060
The purifying flame of Acala...

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.570
A fire scene... I'm in the middle of a fire scene...

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.900
Shinra!

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.240
Shinra!

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.040
Is this...?

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.340
But I'm in Asakusa right now...

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.810
Sho...

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.390
Mom...

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.190
If I don't do something, I'll be killed.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.650
I don't ever want to lose them again.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.780
Precious life... Unique...

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.950
Once it's gone, there's no getting it back.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.620
Tension and fear are making me stiffen up.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.380
If I don't move, I'll die.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:42.130
I'll be killed. Once I'm dead, it's all over.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.800
Am I just a coward?

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.020
Am I going to let this end without doing something?

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.230
What do I do? What can I do?

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.860
I've used up everything that I have. There isn't anything left.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.990
So what can I do?
"So what can I do"

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.540
"Survival instinct"

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.040
Survival instinct.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.710
The strain of death is making me smile.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.340
"Pinch of Energy"

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.140
A Pinch of Energy.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:31.140
What is the fear of death giving me?

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:39.980
"The Press of Death"

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.080
Those flames-- Now you're cooking.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.680
Have you learned anything?

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:17.060
Your flame is not special, nor different from the flames of other pyrokinetics.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.190
And if your flame has no special characteristics,

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.150
then there must be some other trigger for you to Adolla Link.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.360
Lieutenant Konro, both you and Captain Hague from the 4th

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.620
underwent your Adolla Links during the Great Fire.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.870
There were major flames, and many people's deaths.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.250
Perhaps something about that served as the trigger.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.920
Kayoko-san,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.590
you just said his flame was no different from a normal one.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.470
Having actually touched an Adolla Burst,

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.640
is there anything different about it that sets it apart from normal flames?

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.610
Is something the matter?

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.450
No, it's nothing.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.700
I'm going to go around and ask the others who have had Adolla Links.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.490
I know Captain Hague is someone else who carries a stigma.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.210
Talking to him might reveal something.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.040
I bear a holy scar, and the White-Clad came after me.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.380
Are we sure the captain is safe?

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.710
We'd better hurry.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.850
Good! Yes, very good!

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.940
You are someone with considerable skill.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.730
Who are you? I assume you are a member of the White-Clad.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:49.200
You who bear a stigma, I have come for you.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.780
A golden arm...

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.460
How did you... get behind me...?

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.210
There is nothing behind you.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.010
The protectors are not the only weapons the Evangelist has.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:16.520
What exactly... are you?

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.980
A Destroyer.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:30.320
A Fire Soldier's duty is to protect human lives and property.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.030
But one's own life is the most important thing.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.870
Without one's life, lives that may have been saved can no longer be.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.000
Látom.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.300
The death of one of your men sure takes a toll.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:58.180
Pan, always make rational decisions, always act sensibly,

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.350
and at a scene, always treat your own person with great care.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:08.980
We are not heroes. We are human, just like the victims of these fires.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.490
Do you aspire to be a hero, sir?

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.280
Good question.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.450
I think it would be nice if there were such beings beyond our understanding.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.720
Help me get him down from there.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.810
Yes, sir.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.190
There's no sign of any struggle in here.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.490
Are we sure that Captain Hague didn't take his own life?

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:59.280
Captain Hague has been different ever since the Great Fire two years ago.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.330
But he's not someone who would willingly throw his life away.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:04.670
Then that means...

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.460
...that Captain Hague was done in without any chance to fight back.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.670
This was a significantly dangerous foe.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:22.470
He's burning so quietly. But also, incredibly hot.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.520
He's starting to get the hang of it.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.780
Captain Hague?

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.320
In an Adolla Link?

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.960
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.880
Not yet!

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.170
Not yet, not yet!

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:59.550
This is what it is to die. Hysterical Strength of a Fire Scene--

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.520
I can't yet... I can't yet die here!

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.780
Captain Shimon, is that...?

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.950
Yeah. The flame beyond the limits of one's limits.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.700
They're doing it.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.910
All right, that's enough, both of you. Nicely done.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.760
Get so you can go through that sensation at any time.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.180
What... have I done?

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.390
Looks like the training is right on schedule for the first day.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.810
What is it, Shinra?

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.440
That was the "Press of Death."
"The Press of Death"

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.030
Captain Hague is dead?

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:20.970
Captain Hague's death was written up as a suicide, owing to his masochism.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.310
However, the unusual condition of his body, pierced head to toe with stakes,

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.480
made for a gruesome sight that was utterly inconceivable as a suicide.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.030
Okay then...

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.280
Waka, Hague over at the 4th was...

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.830
The White-Clad may come around here again.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.910
Konro, don't go off on your own and do anything behind my back.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.710
Shinra and the others were saying

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.840
that the time had come for the empire to be united.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.970
As long as it benefits Asakusa and the 8th, it's fine with me.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:08.930
The flame is the soul's breath. The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.980
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.860
May thy soul return to the great flame of fire.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.400
Látom.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.700
Captain Hague appears to have been killed in the line of duty.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.790
Captain Burns, since you also possess a stigma, please be careful.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.540
Perhaps you should consider having a bodyguard.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:38.880
This is a trial being bestowed upon us by God.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.720
As such, the 1st must set an example

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.100
as followers of the Holy Sol Temple.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.310
We must demonstrate to all others by our conduct

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:53.350
that we will never back down from this kind of terrorism.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.400
May the flame of Sol be with us...

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.190
...that we become the swords of God...

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.110
...and dispel the darkness.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.870
Okay, let's go and take this country back.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.210
How does the sky feel after all this time?

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.630
Mm-hmm...

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:31.100
It is about to begin-- a new era for humanity!

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:41.480
Shinra, Arthur, Tamaki, it sounds like your training in Asakusa went well.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.030
Good work, all three of you.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.900
--Thank you very much! --Thank you very much!

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.990
Also, thanks to all of our operations so far,

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:52.290
we've managed to form partnerships with each of the other companies.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.200
After the incident with Nataku Son,

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.830
we've even managed to find common cause with Haijima Industries.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:02.300
That's right. When we started, the 8th was fighting all on its own.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.130
But before we knew it, we managed to gain all these allies.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.430
The darkness is illuminated

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.020
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.730
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.150
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.820
The end is illuminated

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.400
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.200
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.490
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:36.370
Flames rise to show us the way
The enemy is a mighty one. There is still much we don't know.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:40.540
But we have friends we can rely on and allies who will stand with us.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:42.250
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:48.050
Now is the time to muster all of our strength to take down the White-Clad!
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:53.810
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.100
Just you wait, Evangelist!

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.600
We're gonna kick your ass, and protect the Tokyo Empire!

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:58.480
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.850
That's the reason why we...

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.320
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.900
...why the Special Fire Force is uniting!

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.410
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.490
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.950
Playthings that make sounds

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.660
and magic that chases pain away

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:19.790
are all precious treasures to me

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:24.340
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:30.260
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:35.220
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.490
I see it... It's streaming in...

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.540
The world under a new sun...

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:05.000
The empire will become as it should be!

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.430
"See you later"
