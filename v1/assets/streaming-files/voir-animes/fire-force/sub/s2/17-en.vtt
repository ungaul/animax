WEBVTT

00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.890
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm!

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.480
I get it! I understand!

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.360
Thank goodness you're so dumb!

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.900
Why, you giant serpent!

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.010
"Episode 17: Boys, Be Weak"

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.940
I will protect you. Go, fire-rat!

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.070
Here I go! Shinrider Kick!

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.160
Damn, that is so hard!

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.210
Stay away from me!

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.090
The radioactive decay isn't stopping.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.250
Radioactive concentration is still climbing!

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.630
This is getting really bad, Shinra!

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.550
Take it easy, Nataku-kun!

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.050
Don't expect anything more out of me!

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.020
Don't expect any more!

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.780
Another 100! Tak-kun, you're so good. You always work so hard.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.820
Tak-kun, you're going to be a fine doctor, just like your father.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.660
I know you can do it. I can't wait to see your future.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.460
No, Mom. You always expect so much.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.630
I mean, that one time I got a bad grade... "Science"

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.260
Augh, what am I going to tell your father?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.800
You aren't keeping a close enough watch over Nataku!

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.180
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.970
I promise, I'll try harder next time. So...

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.310
You're kidding. Nataku is a third generation?

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.230
You're going to take him in at a Haijima facility?

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.070
Tak-kun, I know you can come home soon.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.070
There's no way that the flame's power can get the best of you.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.870
Isn't that right? You can do it, right?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.780
Yes, I can.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.620
You can do it, right?

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.120
Yes, I can.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.500
All right, let's start the experiment.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.000
We're looking forward to some good results today.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.130
You can do it, right?

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.420
Yes.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.340
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do it...

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.890
--I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, --You can do it, you can do it, you can do it...

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.470
"I can do it"
--I can do it, I can do it... --You can do it, you can do it!

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.680
You have a test with your Uncle Reaper today.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.770
You might wind up dead, but you can do this, right?

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.150
Yes, I can.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.360
I will. Leave it to me. I know I... ...can do it!

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.450
I have to. I have to become smarter. I have to become stronger.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.950
Nataku-kun...

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.420
What was that? What did you do? What was that sensation?

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.590
Nataku-kun, take it easy! You have to listen to me!

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.210
Stop it! Stop looking inside me!

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.300
Don't let yourself be carried away by the flames' power!

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.050
It's all right! You're a strong boy, so--

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.430
Yeah, that's right! That's why I can do this!

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.770
I know I can do this! I can do it!

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.480
The radioactive concentration just spiked!

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.940
We're in danger! Hurry up and get to shelter!

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.320
Hey, man, are you serious?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.490
That's an absurd amount of energy. I'm not even kidding.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.780
Huh?

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.410
I can foresee what's going to happen. If that heat ray gets a direct hit,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.040
it will form a crater about 500 kilometers across.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.170
There's nowhere to run from something like that!

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.050
Sister, stay behind here.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.720
Yes, sir.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.880
No-- No, that won't do any good.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.260
It doesn't matter where we run anymore!

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.930
Hurry up and take shelter!

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.100
Where are we supposed to take shelter from that?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.110
I can do it! I've got this!

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.610
I'm going to do this!

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.950
Stop!

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.450
I can do it! I can do this! I have the power!

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.910
I can blow this whole city away!

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.580
I can do anything!

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.830
You dumbass!

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.300
There's nothing I can do!

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.800
I am a protector!

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.930
Charon!

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.440
Haumea, and Inca, and Shinra, and Nataku...

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.360
...cannot be lost!

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.690
Is he...?

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.450
Reflective force of Charon the Reflector!

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.630
This is fun, all right!

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.500
Whoa...

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.340
Maybe I overdid it a little...

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.300
Still, Pillars and their protectors are all about teamwork, right?

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.640
Hang in there cleaning up my mess, Charon.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.440
"How to Raise Good Children"

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.780
Haumea, I'm begging you, do as I tell you for once.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.910
Shut up, shut up, shut the hell up.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:22.710
And Charon, I can see everything that goes on inside your head.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.340
Stop thinking about me all the time!

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.630
Ow!

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.930
Damn... My life is flashing... Imagine, thinking about Haumea right now...

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.390
What an earnest protector I am.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.560
Which is exactly why...!

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.190
I will protect the Pillars or die trying!

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.050
Are you kidding me...?

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.690
The moon... Oh no...

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.450
I can't move another muscle.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.250
You have to stop the Sixth Pillar.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.170
That was close.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.000
That was very close.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:56.930
I was this close to having all the weak people in town blown away at once.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.930
You nearly took them from me.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.360
I'll have to request some extra compensation from the company.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.240
I can do it, Kurono-san! I have to do it!

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.290
Kurono!

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.040
He cut through the flaming one?

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.880
It may not be demon-level, but that armor is still pretty hard!

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.090
He's strong!

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.550
My arm!

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.560
Don't get any stronger.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.480
You've disappointed me, Nataku. You're hopeless.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.990
Please don't say that!

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.030
I can do this!

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.830
Well enough to beat you! I can at least do that much!

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.510
You can do it, right, Tak-kun? You're my pride and joy, after all.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.850
Yeah! I'll do it!

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.680
Oh, no...

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:30.020
It's all right, Mom! Don't worry! I can handle it! I can...!

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.570
You can do it!

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.570
I can... You can do it!

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.200
--I can handle it... --You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.200
--I can... --You can do it!

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.500
I have to do it!

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.670
I have to do it... ...or Mom will...!

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.510
I'm gonna do it!

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.890
Wait, Kurono!

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:17.230
Let me go, Kurono-san! This isn't all I've got! I know I can do better!

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.700
Be stronger! I have to produce results, right?!

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.820
Well I'm going to! I'm going to!

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.660
No.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.370
Why not?! You're expecting me to use my Adolla Burst thingie, right?!

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.130
Please, I know I can do it! I can do more!

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.050
You've done enough.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.590
How come?!

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.970
Don't get any stronger than this.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.970
Why... ...are you telling me that?

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:54.610
I like to bully the weak. You're still a child, right?

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.730
So don't go getting any stronger.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.110
Are you saying you can't expect anything from me?

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.700
"I want to do such and such." "I want to be such and such."

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.450
"I want to become such and such."

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.040
It's out of those thoughts that little boys become stronger.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.580
What's the big rush?

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.210
Right now, you have to hold on to the weakness you have--

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.260
the kind that makes me want to bully you.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.180
It is a very precious and fleeting thing.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.770
So I want you to still stay weak.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.480
Nobody has ever told me anything like that before.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.190
My mom and dad had unreasonable expectations of me.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.860
Always telling me, "You can do it, Nataku."

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.370
But when I couldn't do something, they expressed terrible regrets.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.330
I was terrified of that.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:57.130
The madman inside me spurs me on, ignoring how I feel.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.590
You are still a child.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.430
Is it... okay for me to be weak?

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.850
Yeah. Weak enough for me to want to bully.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.190
Thank you very much.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.740
Radioactive concentration is dropping.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.950
Kurono stopped him.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:34.830
While 99% of people would look at this and say it's a weird relationship,

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.080
for the remaining 1%, it's the best-case scenario.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.840
I guess that makes him the Sixth Pillar's protector.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:51.010
I'm exhausted. Let's leave the Sixth Pillar in Haijima's care,

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.020
and pull out of here for now.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:14:00.480
You can stay right here right now. I can see...

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.570
...what your future holds in store.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.700
They retreated?

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.970
The battle at Haijima, between the 8th, Haijima,

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.180
and the White-Clad, had come to an end.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.890
It had left 32 people dead.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.940
Publicly, it was reported as an accident that had happened

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.860
while performing an Adolla Burst experiment.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.400
It caused a huge crater on the moon, but for the people of earth,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.950
who had experienced the catastrophic damage of the Great Cataclysm,

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.660
it did not cause much of a buzz.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.040
The children are still in the custody of the Haijima laboratory.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.920
The 8th recommended that Haijima cease all extreme experiments

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.380
that had Adolla Bursts as their objective.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.380
But it was Kurono who had stopped Nataku.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.970
I couldn't do anything but stand there and watch.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.890
Kurono is completely messed up,

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.600
but he seems to be a good partner for maintaining Nataku's mental balance.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.440
Our investigation was to try to find a link between Haijima and the Evangelist,

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.980
but after seeing this attack, that connection has to be pretty thin.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:33.490
And so, today, myself, Licht-san, and the captain have been called to Haijima

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.490
to speak about this incident.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.450
Come in.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.880
President Haijima, thank you for seeing us today.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.220
In regards to this recent incident...

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.800
...you all have really done it.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.310
You cannot survive in this nation with Haijima as your foe.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.020
Is that a threat, sir?

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:08.730
I have no intention of wasting either of our precious time with that.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.280
How about we form a united front to counter the Evangelist?

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.740
If you would be willing to work with Haijima,

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.500
I would be willing to reconsider the order to kill Licht.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.830
How would Nataku be treated?

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.250
You're the person who has the Adolla Burst, are you?

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.510
If you will cooperate with our research,

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.930
we will change the sort of experiments we do in the children's facilities.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.810
I do not think that is a bad deal at all.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.390
--I will even drop the charges against you and Licht.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.770
--This is a fight that you started, isn't it? --I will even drop the charges against you and Licht.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.150
Don't get so emotional.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:53.450
The future of the empire rests on the matters we are now discussing.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.870
I'm sure you must know what kind of unit the 8th is.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.790
We are a company that does internal investigations

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.290
into matters concerning the Special Fire Force.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.250
We suspect that Haijima is connected to the Evangelist,

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.920
and that you are hiding something about Amaterasu.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.840
There were non-humans involved in the beginning of the Holy Sol Temple.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.890
If these people were aligned with the Evangelist,

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.510
then it would not be surprising if Haijima was connected to the Evangelist as well.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.520
Amaterasu was built by the Holy Sol Temple and Haijima.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.810
Then doesn't Haijima have a connection to the Evangelist?

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:32.610
Did you know that there was someone inside Amaterasu?

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.990
Yes, of course.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:40.780
Amaterasu operates off of a person that possesses an Adolla Burst.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.870
But so what if it does?

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.710
We cannot shut down Amaterasu.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.460
The entire Tokyo Empire is built upon the sacrifice of one person.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.090
If we shut down Amaterasu,

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.800
what will become of the people who live in this country?

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.470
If the energy that supports their lives were to suddenly disappear,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.770
chaos would be inevitable.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.270
We were also under attack from them.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:12.980
Believe me, there is no connection between Haijima and the Evangelist.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.450
What about Dr. Giovanni, the former captain of the 3rd,

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.070
for which Haijima is the parent company, being connected to the Evangelist?

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.990
The matter with the 3rd is indefensible,

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:28.370
but 70% of the empire's population works for Haijima.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.210
It is quite impossible to keep tabs on all of them.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.840
The Evangelist trying to monopolize the Adolla Bursts

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.050
is becoming a nuisance for Haijima.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:42.180
If you have enough spare time to investigate us, defeat them.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.980
For what reason is Haijima seeking an Adolla Burst?

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.360
To fuel a second Amaterasu.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.700
What do you take people for?! A person with an Adolla Burst is still a person!

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.910
And that one person can save 15 million others.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.500
Without Amaterasu, the empire would collapse.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.130
You possess an Adolla Burst, right?

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.250
If your life could save 15 million others,

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.010
then it would be a small price to pay, yes?

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.010
As a Fire Soldier, you aren't going to tell me

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.100
that your life is more precious than saving others, are you?

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.220
I would lay down my life!

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.390
As a Fire Soldier, if I could give my life to save all the others...

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.520
No, Shinra.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.110
Fire Soldiers' lives are not cheap.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:37.030
Fire Soldiers save the lives of many people by being alive.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:42.660
You may save even more than 15 million lives if you are!

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.540
That's why I'm going to build a power generator better than Amaterasu

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.540
that doesn't require anyone to be sacrificed to it!

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.710
Hold it, you!

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.090
--Don't you worry, Shinra! There's no way I'm going to let you be sacrificed!

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.340
--Vulcan... --Don't you worry, Shinra! There's no way I'm going to let you be sacrificed!

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.510
--A member of the Joseph family that built Amaterasu. --The hell?! You want some? --Why, you!

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.510
--What? --Get your hands off of me! --G-Get over here!

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.850
--It's all right. Let him in. --Get your hands off of me! --G-Get over here!

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.430
Let me go!

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.100
You the president of Haijima?

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.440
You said you could make a generator better than Amaterasu

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.110
that doesn't require a sacrifice?

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.320
Yeah. My dream is to bring the world back to life.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.780
We're going to need something more than Amaterasu to do that.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.030
No matter what happens, we are not sacrificing Shinra.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.000
I promise you, we will keep Shinra safe.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.750
Captain... Vulcan...

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.130
Charon did say that the Pillars had their protectors.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:43.760
Everyone at the 8th is protecting me.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.680
So you say. If you can make that happen,

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.890
then it would be a dream come true for us, as well.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.770
Haijima will back you. The 8th, as well.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.150
But then, are you sure you can do it?

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.740
--Of course he can! --Of course I can!

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.740
There is one condition, though.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.240
We are to be entitled according to the proportion of our investment.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.870
If you supply me with the goods I require, I don't need any rights to it.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.460
Not if it brings the world back around.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.550
Then it's settled.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.880
Haijima's bottom-line goal is to make a profit.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.720
But they don't have any connection to the Evangelist.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.180
So now we're in a coalition with Haijima.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.640
What has happened to Nataku Son?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.610
Nothing new. He is taking part in Adolla Burst experiments today, as usual.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.020
More of those cruel experiments?!

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.320
We are keeping a careful watch over him. Rest easy.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.910
You've gotten so you can control your flame pretty well, huh?

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:54.200
No, I'm still apprehensive without my fireproof cloak.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.250
It's all right. You can do this.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.000
--I can do this. --You can do this.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.010
Okay, it's time to play with your Uncle Reaper again today.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.680
Right.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.020
Don't be so tense. Just stay nice and weak. Please.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:21.980
Right!

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.500
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.620
"Next time"

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.420
The Holy Sol Temple.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.590
It is salvation for those who live in fear of the flame terror.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:14.390
However, Great Sol, is it right for me to believe in You?

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.180
Will you pray with me?

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:23.980
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 18, "The Holy Woman's Anguish."

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:28.450
"Episode 18: The Holy Woman's Anguish"

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.210
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.240
