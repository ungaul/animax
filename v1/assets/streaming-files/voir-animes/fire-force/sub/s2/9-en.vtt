00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.150
"Prologue: The Great Cataclysm"

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.426
A long time ago, mankind was touched by the planet's anger,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.256
and the world was engulfed in flames.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.976
It was the Day of the Cataclysm.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.596
The flames burned ferociously,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.186
with an intensity threatening to incinerate the places mankind lived in,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.436
the languages they spoke, and the culture they had built up.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.220
"Chapter One: Holy Fire"

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.656
As the world was being covered in ash, one man appeared.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.956
He would later be called Raffles I.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.746
Raffles took his disciples and left on a journey in search of light.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.876
At the end of his journey, he found an "unsullied flame,"

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.900
and brought forth the light that would be mankind's salvation.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.530
"Chapter Two: Amaterasu"

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.306
Raffles and his disciples used the flame bestowed by the great Sol

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.686
and the technology cultivated by mankind to create "Amaterasu."

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.486
The sacred flame of Amaterasu benefited the lives of mankind,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.220
and ended up establishing the foundation of a state in the Far East.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.796
Pi?!

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.676
These numbers?

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.676
Yeah.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.306
See? It's easy to tell from the numbers on this wall.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.516
"I'm going to cry, Brother Goya" [79458213].

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.726
Arthur-kun, you've memorized pi?

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.276
The fact that the word "pi" came out of Arthur's mouth is surprising enough.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.276
Though, to be sure,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.100
this is a random, irregular sequence of numbers.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.116
It's well within the realm of possibility.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.206
How is it that you've memorized pi?

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.666
Because I'm a Knight of the Round Table.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.006
I did some checking into circles.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.296
The Round Table? A ridiculous reason like that?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.176
That's just like you, Arthur-kun.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.620
By the way...

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.346
What is pi?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.330
What is... ...the Round Table?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.326
Everything I've had, I've lost,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.626
but I won't let go of this remaining spark

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.206
No, I won't let it go, not ever

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.796
Though there may be no right answers in my ill-defined tale,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.966
once I'm able to step forward...

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.646
They say something's wrong with me, but I'll do something with them

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.606
I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.236
But if my dreams have resolved themselves to be by your side

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.286
then there's nothing left for me to doubt anymore

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.116
Sparks fly as things kick off

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.956
until "black and white" turns to ashen gray

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.876
If there's a choice crown to be had

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.756
I want it, I want it I'll whizz my way toward you

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.676
until "double or nothing" gets zeroed out

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.466
If the clowns are melancholy

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.306
then nothing will get anywhere

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.646
I'll show you a love that burns hot enough to scorch ashes

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.300
I just spark again

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.430
"Episode 9: The Core"

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.286
Pi is the value representing how many times

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.206
the diameter of a circle can go into its circumference.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.126
It's generally known as the number 3.14,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.820
but its precise value is still under calculation, with no answer yet.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.346
It's not as though I don't trust you, Arthur-kun,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.056
but until we get back to Tokyo and check these tablets against pi...

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.556
Could these tablets be the switch for the Tabernacle's destructive energy?

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.026
I have trouble believing that lining up these tablets

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.066
will make the Tabernacle go into overload,

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.406
but there may be something else in here that acts as a startup key.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.260
Let's look around.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.520
That was... ...another Adolla Link.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.150
A devilish woman...

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.870
Yoruba Forge!

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.516
Don't flip your lid about putting the demon to rest,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.806
and then just stand around!

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.936
...S-Sorry! ...Kotatsu-san! They're coming from this way, too!

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.736
Well of course they are! We're surrounded, after all!

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.590
Fire-Cat's Tails!

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.406
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.786
The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.166
Ashes thou wert and art. May thy soul...

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.610
...return to the great flame of fire.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.966
She's begun the prayer. Let's do this, Shinra!

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.070
Yeah!

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.290
Wah! You missed some of them!

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.790
Yoruba Brand!

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.630
Finish them off!

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.850
Return to the great flame of fire.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.480
Nice going, hero!

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.570
How dare you eliminate my servants!

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.660
Kotatsu-san!

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.920
That's one down.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.970
Juggernaut!

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.536
Ah! How could this happen?!

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.126
Treat him right away!

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:10.756
...Good. You're safe, Kotatsu-san...No it's not! Juggernaut! This is... This is...

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.716
Oh,

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.506
no, no, there's nothing inside there where the hole is.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.426
Eh?
Huh?

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.806
Whew. It's a good thing I'm wearing extra layers.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.516
This isn't a question of extra layers!

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.090
What have you got going on inside there?!

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.380
...Juggernaut! ...Juggernaut!

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.260
Yoruba Spears!

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.680
...Gah! Juggernaut! ...He's had it for sure this time!

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.246
No he hasn't!

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.166
Lucky for me, I dress warmly.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.940
...Are you for real? ...He's a quasi-unkillable character.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.086
You seem to be quite tough.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.086
But I am done playing games with you.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.030
I will personally send you into the afterlife now.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.180
Die, and become mine!

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.080
How do you like this?!

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.366
He's strong. Even using Corna,

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.810
I don't have enough firepower to put this demon to rest.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.560
What do we do, Shinra? We'll all be wiped out at this rate...

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.256
Damn it!

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.120
Protect...

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.016
You again?!

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.000
I am protecting it! Scop and the others asked me to!

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.936
"Protect the forest..."

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.436
Protect the forest... Look, I get it, all right?

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.130
But I don't have the means!

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.310
The devilish woman...

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.126
You're the one who's calling out to me, right? Where are you?!

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.480
Scop and the others are waiting for you to return!

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.570
Protect...

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.780
...the forest...

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:12.936
You cut right through that sturdy lock! I'm not going onto sacred ground!

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.236
Don't go ravaging everything you see!

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.316
This... ...is the Tabernacle's central core.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.680
Is that a mechanical sound? It's almost like the pulse of a living creature.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:32.376
What is inside there? I'm sensing an incredible energy.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.716
That area with the stone tablets encircled the whole central core.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.426
"Current location" "Stone tablet corridor"

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:44.056
Imagine, such simple architecture giving rise to such tremendous energy.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.460
If there is an Adolla Burst inside that door, then this is as far as we can go.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.516
What's that?

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.776
A white-feathered arrow. It looks like an arrow is stuck in the keyhole.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.260
There are more of them lined up over there.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.276
Seven of them in all.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.366
And the arrowheads look like keys.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.036
Including the one stuck in the keyhole,

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.980
there are a total of eight of them.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.400
Eight of them...

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.876
Pillars... white-feathered arrows...

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.740
And the word suggested by both of them is...

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.790
"Sacrifices."

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.186
In the old proto-national culture,

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.556
it's said that houses of those who would become sacrifices

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.566
were marked by a white-feathered arrow.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.356
This pulse sounds like it must be from something alive.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.816
If the Tabernacle... ...and Amaterasu...

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.010
...both have an Adolla Burst powering them...

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.536
...then it's just as Joker's secret investigation uncovered...

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.190
The source of Amaterasu's power...

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.110
...is a person possessing an Adolla Burst!

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.596
Sacrifices? You're not saying that inside there is...?

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:11.726
Yes. There's a good chance that it's the Woman in Black that Scop mentioned.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:16.146
No way. Scop is waiting for her, right?

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.686
But then, if that Woman in Black is in here,

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.390
it would explain why Shinra is Linking with this building.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.286
You're here, aren't you?

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.560
That's you, right? The woman that Scop and the others have been waiting for?

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.836
I can sense Adolla.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.586
It's just like with the Evangelist,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.870
except that it's an amazingly gentle feeling.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.160
Who exactly are you?

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.600
Hey, Shinra!

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.746
Give me a hand! I'm getting my ass handed to me over here!

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.006
Sorry, Ogun, but you have to buy me some time!

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.586
If this works, I may be able to put that demon to rest!

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.586
Huh?!

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.780
Please.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.966
You are... ...the woman that Scop says...

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.080
...is the one who built the Tabernacle, aren't you?!

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.686
Grace!

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.010
Can you grant me the kind of Grace that the Evangelist offers?!

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.866
I don't completely get it, but all I have to do is buy some time, right?

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.236
Ogun, I'll help, too!

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.730
No. I can handle this by myself.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.740
Time to crank things up!

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.620
Flamy Ink!

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.680
If all I have to do is buy time...

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.376
...I can just keep chaining combos like this...

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.296
...shooting hoops off to the side, right?!

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.586
Whoa!

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.636
I-Incredible!

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.756
I see now.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.056
Those stories were about Ogun!

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.596
The ones about there being a new recruit at the 4th

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.596
who could temporarily produce firepower that rivaled Captain Burns!

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.026
Dam! Dam! Dam! Dam! Dam! Dam! Dam! Dam! Dam! Dam! Dam! Dam!

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:10.446
It's incredible, all right, but I can't make heads or tails of what's going on.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.196
From the stories I've heard,

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.536
while he has those flame bands circling his body,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.956
he is apparently able to forcibly increase his physical abilities. But...

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.246
...is he really going to be okay, putting out so much firepower?

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.916
I wish there was something that I could do to help,

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.610
but I'm not sure I could keep up with that speed.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.310
You slippery little...

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.840
Ogun...

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.906
You never give up, do you? But it is about time we finished this...

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.946
Nya! I'm over here, too!

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:37.866
Tamaki!

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.600
Nekomata!

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.730
You fight, too, Juggernaut!

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.796
Huh?

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.756
Eh?!

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.876
We all have to buy time together!

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.650
Stop, Tamaki!

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.756
You cannot defeat me.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.926
I know that!

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:03.266
But there is still something that I can do! Nya!

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.686
Wah! Here he comes!

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.960
Stay away!

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.236
Hey! Don't trash the forest!

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.220
S-Sorry!

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.036
Oh yeah!

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.036
Any more than that will be dangerous for you!

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.940
I'll be fine.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.676
I'm gonna... ...crank it up even higher!

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.570
Here goes!

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:52.130
Shoot!

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.816
Aren't you ready yet, Shinra?! I said I would buy you some time,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.866
but I can't keep this up long! Do something before I Overheat!

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.656
Y-Yeah!

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.140
Don't think that you can press your luck forever!

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.780
Take this!

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.000
Hold it!

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.686
Come on, I know you're there! Answer me!

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.436
Scop and the others are waiting for you!

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.896
What's going on, Shinra? Is she there?

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.826
Yeah. The woman you're waiting for is in there, making the Tabernacle run.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:30.286
She's what?! You mean, she's been burning for the sake of our forest?

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.416
Scop, you call out to her, too!

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.900
If we can use her power, we can put that demon to rest!

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.636
You have worked a miracle here in this wasteland!

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.910
I, too, want to preserve the forest and animals that you have been protecting!

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.290
Shinra...

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:04.116
I'm asking, too, lady! All we've ever done is be saved by you in every way,

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.390
but I'm begging you, help us out once again!

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:29.370
Your call... has been... heard...

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.960
However... I only have...

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:43.830
...enough power left... to preserve... the forest...

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:56.060
I am... unable to...

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:04.740
...provide you with an ample amount... of Adolla Grace...

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.160
Ample? It doesn't have to be ample!

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:18.226
But... in my current condition...

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.670
...if I were to give you Grace...

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.090
One second...

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.020
What can you do in a single second...?

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:40.610
Such a small sliver of Grace would be... meaningless...

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.580
Just one second?

00:21:53.540 --> 00:22:01.540
I am sorry that I... could not be... of any more help...

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.360
One second will be plenty.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.476
Most incidences have their own name

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.356
But no one knows and I'm upside down

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.156
Billions of people exist

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.826
But not anybody tells me what that is

00:22:52.850 --> 00:23:00.496
Sacrificing my limited life Am I moving forward or not

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:07.626
I just want to believe Nothing goes to waste

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.006
I question myself Why I can't be who I want to be

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:17.636
tangled and translucent It drains me

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.976
Pretending and overextending myself

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.356
Wish one day I could love pathetic myself

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.406
Hoping for a dazzling future to come

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:35.036
Don't over decorate smile clumsily

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:42.456
Just live life the way I am This world is cruel

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.666
Can't choose how to be born

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:50.546
Stick up the middle finger then

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:55.410
Let's shoot off to the other side

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.976
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.540
"Next time"

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:09.276
Shinra can only obtain the Woman in Black's Adolla Grace for one second.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:14.446
But that second is their one and only hope. Please hurry, Shinra-san!

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:17.036
Shinra, how long are you going to leave me hanging?!

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:17.286
"Episode 10: The Woman in Black"

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:23.746
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 10, "The Woman in Black."

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:28.506
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.530
