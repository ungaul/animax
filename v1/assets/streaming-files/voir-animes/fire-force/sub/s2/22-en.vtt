00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.670
<i>In this charred world,
a boy appeared.</i>

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.680
<i>He will become the man
who will be called "Raffless I".</i>

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.760
<i>leading his disciples,</i>

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.100
<i>he began to seek the light.</i>

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.980
<i>After a long journey, he
found the eternal flame,</i>

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.400
<i>A light capable of
saving humanity.</i>

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.730
It's going to heat up, Sho!

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.100
You are not my brother!

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.470
You disgust me...
Why don't you give up?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.930
You have no memory
of me, confess!

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.470
Stop making that face!
You laughed and you cried before!

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.810
You looked more human!

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.560
<i>Were you afraid of the dark?
Do not worry !</i>

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.440
<i>Your big brother is here!</i>

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.190
That was one of your memories, right?

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.110
It was disgusting!

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.780
Stay out of my head!

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.280
We are brothers, you and me!

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.280
Stopped !

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.020
I won't stop!

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.950
Not until I bring you back!

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.670
<i>Remember !</i>

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.710
<i>When we were a family...</i>

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.800
I will catch you!

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.640
<i>He's a real demon...</i>

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.020
<i>He disgusts me.</i>

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.140
<i>Take a look at his face.</i>

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.520
<i>It seems that he smiled like that</i>

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.860
<i>when his family died.</i>

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.240
<i>Are these still
Shinra's memories?</i>

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.580
<i>Wait for me.</i>

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.200
<i>His memories</i>

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.520
<i>interfere more and
more in my brain...</i>

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.510
<i>Frankly,</i>

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.590
<i>I don't quite know how
it feels to see Shô again.</i>

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.810
<i>But I promised our
mother to protect the bonds</i>

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.220
<i>that make us a family!</i>

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.340
Promises... Links...

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.690
What does all this mean?

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.730
You're right.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.570
My promise meant a lot,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.200
but now that I've found you,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.030
it no longer matters so much.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.690
Your thoughts don't interest me.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.940
Really ?

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.340
<i>Look, it's Shinra!</i>

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.260
<i>He killed his mother!</i>

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.550
<i>And his little brother, who was a baby!</i>

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.180
<i>What ?  But how ?</i>

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.510
<i>He burned them.</i>

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.080
<i>He's a demon.</i>

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.980
It's not me !

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.960
There was something that day.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.820
Someone other than
mom, Shô and me.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.240
I swear to find him

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.660
and burn it to ashes!

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.660
<i>Have you seen his face?</i>

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.010
<i>It's a demon!</i>

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.580
Leave me alone !

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.870
Since the fire, I smile
when I'm nervous.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.710
I would have killed Shô, me?

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.280
<i>I am not a demon!</i>

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.800
<i>I would love to see them again...</i>

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.590
<i>Mom...</i>

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.180
<i>Sho...</i>

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.430
What do you want to do by
showing me these memories?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.060
I'm not your little brother!

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.860
We are the same, you and me.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.190
Why can't you smile anymore?

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.150
You always smiled
when you were a baby.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.370
I have no past.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.070
I do not need it.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.630
What I just saw...

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.970
Was it a lost memory?

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.470
Twelve years ago,

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.270
we were a family.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.480
Mom, you and me.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.530
Until the day of this fire,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.860
one could smile most
naturally in the world.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.870
We laughed happily with mom.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.810
We were happy.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.770
We were brothers
and we were a family.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.230
<i>Sho...</i>

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.830
<i>Shinra...</i>

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.920
<i>I love you !</i>

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.130
This woman... is she my mother?

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.430
<i>What are you cooking, mom?</i>

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.140
<i>Chopped steaks!</i>

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.180
<i>Great !</i>

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.770
<i>Sho is crying!
I have to wash my hands...</i>

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.850
<i>Leave it to me!</i>

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.610
<i>I will help Sho!</i>

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.730
<i>Wait, Sho, I'm coming!</i>

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.030
<i>Are you OK ?
Your big brother is here!</i>

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.200
<i>The wind took the newspaper...</i>

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.410
<i>I'll take it off you,
wait a second.</i>

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.460
<i>It's dark.</i>

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.480
<i>I'm afraid.  Help me !</i>

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.840
<i>The light...</i>

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.640
<i>Were you afraid of the dark?</i>

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.180
<i>Do not worry !
Your big brother is here!</i>

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.400
<i>Do not Cry.</i>

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.920
<i>Your brother is a superhero.</i>

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.530
<i>You're reassured, aren't you?</i>

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.550
<i>I will always be
there to protect you.</i>

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.210
You were plunged into darkness.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.670
Sorry for leaving
you alone for so long.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.010
I'll get you out of here

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.930
and bring you back to the light!

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.020
Trust me.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.520
<i>This boy is</i>

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.190
<i>my brother.</i>

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.480
Let's go.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.700
Shinra!

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.460
Sho... It's not your fault...

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.470
Haumea!

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.260
Hi !

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.940
Look at this !

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.900
You went too fast and you
planted yourself on that sword!

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.260
Shinra Kusakabe
has the Adora Burst...

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.490
I have to get him back,
I'd be sorry if he died.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.020
It's not good at all...
Yet another enemy!

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.750
Who are you ?

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.800
It was you and your
comrades who kidnapped Shô?

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.380
What do you want to do with
the holders of the Adora Burst?

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.680
The Great Catastrophe of

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.760
250 years ago ended in failure.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.980
But with enough Adora Burst,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.230
we can cause
another Catastrophe!

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.610
That's why we use our insects

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.940
to look for people like you!

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.860
And that's why we need Shô too!

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.200
Shut up, you talk too much there!

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.410
Ah damn !

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.830
Oh, anyway, even if I tell him

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.330
everything, he can't stop us.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.290
Come on, it's time to
get Shinra back to base!

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.000
What's wrong with you, Sho?

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.570
First tell me what
happened 12 years ago.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.590
I only respond to
violent interrogations!

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.640
You should try hitting me!

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.760
I'm not kidding.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.180
Come on, push yourself.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.310
Separation of spaces!

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.730
Well then, do you have a problem?

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.650
Time does not stop!

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.190
My link is broken?

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.490
Sho!

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.890
Sho...

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.340
What did you do ?

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.260
But it's because you seem
to me still full of energy!

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.910
Come on, it's time to get out of here.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.180
Shinra...

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.230
Well...

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.530
She dodged at the last moment.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.110
Arthur...

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.450
Commanding officer...

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.750
It's up to me to defeat
you in battle, Demon!

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.410
So don't die here.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.880
Is that this place is full
of intruders, suddenly!

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.010
Watch out, Arthur...
She's using a weird technique.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.390
Shut your mouth !  Don't bother talking.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.990
Let me do.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.480
You bother me, you, so broom!
Oust!

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.610
Here, that doesn't work.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.610
Did you just want to surprise me?
Come on, come fight!

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.820
Plasma?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.180
So you've jammed
my electrical signal...

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.120
It was not the time to
come and bother me!

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.230
Hurry, Hauméa, we
have no time to lose!

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.580
It's okay, I know!

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.190
I will eliminate
them in two seconds.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.960
What the hell is this again?

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.340
My iron owl...

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.010
He shorted out...

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.890
Help Shinra while I hold her!

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.640
Understood !

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.660
Commanding officer !

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.350
Plasma filth!

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.110
It blurs my attack and prevents it
from reaching his nervous system.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.320
But why did it take

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.400
he arrives, this moron?

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.980
You have nothing to
fear anymore, Shinra.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.790
An earthquake !  It begins...

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.590
What a jolt!

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.460
I have a bad feeling.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.180
The Great Preacher
has taken action.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.220
We must leave, Haumea!

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.160
We'll meet again if you survive!

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.620
Sho...

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.650
Hold on !  Sho!

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.150
- Come back...
- Don't move!

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.990
We have to go out too!

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.270
It's still shaking...

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.690
This earthquake is far too long.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.650
It is therefore a blow
of the Great Preacher.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.440
But what is he up to?

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.530
Sho...

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.910
Shinra!  Above all, don't fall asleep!

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.490
You must live to see
your brother again!

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:58.620
Let's go to the emergency room.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.790
We will give it to our colleague.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.710
She is by far the best
healer in the whole Empire.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:19.940
Doctor Huang!

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.270
Where are you, doctor?

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.280
It's urgent !

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.240
What's going on ?

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.500
Thank you for
answering our call!

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.040
We have a serious injury!

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.090
I received a message from the Empire.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.300
Was he on the mission?

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.050
Yes...

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.890
Have you seen the Underground?

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.850
Do they have a link with this long earthquake?

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.930
The Underground
is a forbidden place...

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.400
Did you anger the Sun-God?

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.190
Of course not.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.780
The Great Preacher
and the men in

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.360
white are the origin
of the human torches.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:15.320
They are looking for the holders
of a flame named "Adora Burst"

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.660
and want to destroy the world!

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.170
You will explain that to me later.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.540
Captain Huang...

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.210
Can you save Shinra?

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.130
It's not going to be easy.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.680
He already has to hold on.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.270
And even if I manage to keep him

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.770
alive, he might
still be paralyzed.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.060
It's a 3rd generation with
the Adora Burst, right?

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:48.400
Yes.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.440
I have never yet been in contact
with this so-called sacred flame.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.990
I am in unknown territory.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.620
Shinra means a lot to us!

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.480
save him,

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:03.540
You're welcome !

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.340
I will do my best
no matter what.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.350
Sun God,

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.310
keep Shinra alive...

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.020
We managed to pull the sword out.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.570
His pulse is stable.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.610
My powers will do the rest.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.240
But given the injury,

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.200
who knows if that will be enough...

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.740
Everything will rest on his flame.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.400
I go.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.900
Beginning of the final phase
of Shinra Kusakabe's operation!

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.840
Rod of Asclepius!

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.480
O snake, heal this boy!

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.860
She's been in surgery
for an hour now.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.650
Where are the others ?

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.070
Iris went to pray for
Shinra to pull through.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.780
Commander Hinawa gets treatment

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.890
and Licht does some research.

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.290
And Vulcan?

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.770
He is with Risa.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.420
Apparently she suffered
a big psychological shock.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.930
So the 6th Brigade
is a hospital?

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.300
What are they doing ?

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.180
You really are ignorant, my word.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.890
Within the Empire,

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.100
only the Church of the Holy
Sun is authorized to provide care.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:53.070
The 6th brigade therefore
belongs to the Church, a

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.610
bit like the 1st, but it
specializes in medicine.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.080
So this place is a church and
a hospital at the same time.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.930
It's a special squad!

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.580
And Captain Huang is

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.270
apparently the
best healer there is.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.420
She is said to have
unique healing powers.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.010
What's so special
about these powers?

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:24.010
She can control a flame
serpent capable of healing

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.720
various injuries and illnesses.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.480
And if the patient himself
possesses powers,

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.150
it can act directly on its fire.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.470
What a beautiful flame.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.280
I believe everything should be fine.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.570
The Adora Burst is amazing.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.410
But his flame has been
completely consumed,

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.080
he will take several
days to wake up.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.050
<i>3 days later,</i>

00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.090
<i>clear sky.</i>

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.880
<i>I finally woke up.</i>

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.470
I'm starving.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.560
I want to eat rice.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.100
<i>What happened to Sho?</i>

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.230
<i>I saved him</i>

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.190
<i>and he returned to
the Great Preacher...</i>

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.450
<i>We should have</i>

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.160
<i>to be able to look at this sky together.</i>

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.630
Shit !

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.920
You woke up exactly as
Captain Huang said you would.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.760
It might just be the sun,
but you look pretty good.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.980
You're still
recovering, so rest.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.850
Glad to see you alive.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.810
Captain Barnes...

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.190
What are you doing here ?

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.110
I came to see you.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.760
See me ?

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:06.620
When I'm just a simple 2nd
class from another brigade?

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.910
Am I bothering you ?

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.600
No way !

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.790
If you don't mind, I'd

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.040
like to chat with you.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.250
Let's talk about the
fire 12 years ago.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.510
Change yourself.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.640
We're going for a walk.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.830
I brought you a snack too.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.030
You have a hell of an appetite.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.110
Yes, I eat more than average.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.560
You have grown well.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.660
You've known me
for 12 years, right?

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.690
The firefighter that
day was you, right?

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.920
Did you know everything?

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.260
Yes.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.090
If I had told the truth
about what happened, you

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.680
would never have been
accused of killing your family.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.560
I don't care about being accused!

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.520
You also knew Shô
was still alive, didn't you?

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.810
Yes of course.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:23.480
And you knew he had been
kidnapped by the Great Preacher?

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.530
Yes I knew it.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.450
And you didn't help him?

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.200
Why didn't you tell me?

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.690
If I had known, Shô would never
have spent 12 years in darkness!

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.420
Even 12 years later,

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.920
you almost lost
your life learning

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.090
the truth, so what
was the point then?

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.380
It was just an accident!

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.300
I have progressed since our fight.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.970
Really ?

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.520
I believe you were lucky.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.020
But I invite you to
prove me wrong.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.690
I am waiting for you.
