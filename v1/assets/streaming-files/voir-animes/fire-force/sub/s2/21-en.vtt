WEBVTT

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.660
Violet Flash!

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.290
He avoided that?!

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.050
That one was pretty fast. If I hadn't read your pheromones,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.630
I wouldn't have dodged you.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.840
You're so gross!

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.850
Bombardier Beetle!

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.060
Get off me, you idiot!

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.150
--At least let me get out of the way! --Ow... hot... hot...!

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.820
Superheated gas. There's no escaping it.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.030
What are you all sneaking around in the Nether about?!

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.360
Everything is ready.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.200
Our presence in the Nether is only a matter of time now.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.370
What?

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.080
The extinction of this world is imminent.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.370
Very shortly, the Pillars will be gathered,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.090
and the Evangelist's plan will be completed.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.090
We're going to put a stop to that plan!

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.760
Haven't you discovered in your investigations

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.060
that the Tokyo Empire was created by means of the Evangelist's plan?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.520
As were the Holy Sol Temple and Amaterasu, all for this moment.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.150
It is mankind itself that wishes to perish more than anything, isn't it?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.320
There is no stopping it now.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.820
You say that mankind wishes to perish?

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.530
Our mission as Fire Soldiers is to protect people's lives and property.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.870
Don't go deciding things for everyone!

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.170
Are you saying that the Fire Force will deprive humanity of its chance

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.920
to arrive at a higher plane by passing through destruction?

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.800
Well, no matter. You will find out soon enough.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.680
Just like your brother did.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.020
What?!

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.060
What happened to Sho?

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.940
He is standing by quietly. Almost as though he were a puppet.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.290
I've always wanted one of these--

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.960
a doll as pretty as this one.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.510
Don't look away, Arrow. You stand there quietly and watch.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.590
Watch as I play with my doll.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.700
"Episode 22: Plot for Extinction"

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.700
Where... ...is Sho right now?

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.040
He is where the Pillars need to be, prior to the coming of the Great Cataclysm.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.920
Your brother is on his best behavior, unlike you.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.420
By now, he is probably Haumea's plaything.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.350
Even if you can read my mind, I just have to move faster than you can react!

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.770
No one is there. Did he vanish?

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.480
I'm right here.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.530
Non!

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.740
Such tremendous acceleration...

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.380
It seems you do not intend to come with us.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.920
I once sensed the kind of bloodlust you possess.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.220
There's no way I'd ever trust anyone with a heart as sinister as yours!

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.310
Sensed?

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.020
Then you and I were connected? Via an Adolla Link?

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.730
You're certain you heard my voice, right?

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.690
Yeah! So what if I did?!

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.280
That's incredible! I'm so glad you told me! Thank you! Thank you!

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.820
You're saying that a mere human like me connected to you through Adolla?

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.790
Only those who are connected to Adolla can undergo an Adolla Link!

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.420
My Insect experiments! This is the fruit borne of them!

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.420
I have become closer to Adolla!

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.500
Then are you saying that I can't hear the voices of those

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.840
who have never connected with Adolla?

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.550
It stands to reason! An Adolla Link

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.600
can only be achieved between those who have an Adolla Burst,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.930
or have been in contact with Adolla.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.730
Hold on. I've heard the voices of others through an Adolla Link twice before.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.360
Once with Dr. Giovanni... Kill Vulcan.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.280
...and the other time was... Shinra!

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.450
...with Lieutenant Konro.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.960
If you can't have an Adolla Link without an Adolla Burst,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.000
then how did I hear Lieutenant Konro?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.420
Is something the matter?

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.380
Shut up!

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.880
The Evangelist resides not in this world, but in Adolla.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.890
How are you going to stop the Evangelist, who is in another world?

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.350
I don't care if you can meddle with the higher plane of Adolla,

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.230
the most that you can do is peer into it.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.480
Are you saying it's impossible for us to go to Adolla?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.440
How are you going to put the fire to rest if you do not go to the scene, Fire Soldier?

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.200
This world is doomed to do nothing else but burn away now.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.330
We humans are nothing more than the fuel in which this world will burn!

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.660
Humanity has worshipped the sun.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.040
There is no way we will turn down burning as brightly as the sun!

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.000
Just as the Evangelist has instilled upon us, right?!

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.550
Ritsu is getting everything ready now.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.220
Allow us to demonstrate now, at the onset,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.140
how people are implements of destruction.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.430
By utilizing the Nether,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.100
the Tokyo Empire on the surface will be utterly destroyed.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.940
Demolition?!

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.230
Are you certain?

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.570
Yes, it's most likely.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.280
The enemy intends to use Infernals as a shaped charge.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.820
Shaped charge?

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.820
From what I saw of the sensors that Vulcan-kun showed me,

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.540
the Infernals are positioned in this conical arrangement.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.080
Is there some significance to this arrangement?

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.540
The shaped charge used in demolition

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.670
employs a phenomenon known as the Munroe-Neumann effect,

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.300
which requires this sort of cone-shaped explosive.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.350
When you line the interior of the explosive with a thin metal lining, and then detonate it,

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.600
the metal forms a jet forced by the shockwave from the explosion

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.560
straight up through the center of the cone.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.730
The metal flies up utilizing the shock of the explosion,

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.230
so that jet is powerful enough to blow a hole through anything it hits.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.820
With Infernals standing in as explosives to create that shaped charge,

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.780
they are planning to use minimal firepower to produce maximum damage.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.790
Geographically, we are at the center of the Tokyo Empire.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.960
The damage will be enormous.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.630
So you're saying that if they perform this demolition in the Nether...

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.590
The Tokyo Empire will be laid to waste.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.260
Is there anything we can do to prevent it?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.390
I heard what was happening.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.230
I'm late getting back here because the man behind me was dragging his feet.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.390
Detective Oze...

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.400
I've memorized the entire layout of the construction in the Nether.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.440
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.820
The critical component of a shaped charge is the direction of the jet.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.240
If that can be altered, we may be able to get out of this.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.370
To do that, we'll need a second generation

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.580
who can control flames over a wide area.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.040
Lieutenant Hinawa is a master of pinpoint precision,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.920
so he is not suited to this kind of operation.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.420
Tch, you're useless.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.670
Hmm? Hey, hey, hey, hey! This is no time for chewing the fat!

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.880
They're about to explode!

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.680
What do we do?! Are there no other second generation pyrokinetics?!

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.810
No second generations who can affect a wide area.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:49.400
There's only one person I know of who can pull off anything this freakish.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.280
First Class Fire Soldier Maki Oze-- oh, make that Secretary Oze--

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.280
who, as I recall, you took away from us, Detective--

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.660
Ah! There's no point in talking about people who aren't even here!

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.370
We'll just have to do it with the second generations we have on hand!

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.410
Lieutenant Hinawa, give me a hand with this!

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.410
I can't. I'm useless.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.370
Wha--?!

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.080
You toot your own horn about putting lives first,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.420
but when it comes down to it, the 8th is nothing more than a violent gang!

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.970
We will manage something. The 8th does put lives first.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.300
If we don't stop this, there will be mass casualties on the surface.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.180
Vulcan!

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.260
Right!

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.600
When it comes to saving lives, regulations be damned!

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.520
Right... ...Maki-san?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.940
--Maki?! --Maki-san?!

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.280
S-Sorry I'm late!

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.740
I'm up to speed on the situation, thanks to the communicator I got from Vulcan.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.200
The 8th doesn't hold back anything from each other.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.740
You're sure about this?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.660
--Yes, sir. --What are you doing here?!

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.960
It's too dangerous!

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.750
Are you still going on about that?

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.380
Right now, saving lives comes first.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.790
That doesn't mean you have to risk your life to do it!

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.340
Why not? You're taking a risk by coming down here, too!

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.920
But you're a girl!

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.390
So I can't stick my neck out just because I'm female?

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.470
Are you going to take me off the front line, like Mom?

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.390
I... am going to use my power to keep people safe!

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.230
Vulcan, let me know when!

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.690
You got it. The explosion is near. Just stand by as you are.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.610
Maki, there's still time! Hurry up and evacuate!

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.280
--Maki! --A moment, please!

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.780
It's true that with Maki-san's help, we can inhibit the shaped charge.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.870
But it will not stop the flames that will be produced by the explosion!

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.460
There is nowhere in the Nether that will allow the flames to escape!

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.370
Meaning?

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.340
Meaning that those of us still in the Nether...

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.510
...are all about to be roasted to death!

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.760
I hate to say!

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.140
The way this is heading, we're all dead?!

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.810
What are you talking about, Licht?!

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.730
If we use Maki-san's ability to control the direction

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.690
of the Infernal-explosive shaped charge,

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.740
we can prevent this facility and the rest of Tokyo from being destroyed,

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.610
but this is the Nether.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.240
There is nowhere for the flames created by the explosion to go,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.490
so we're all going to burn to death from the heat of the trapped flames!

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.660
Except for Crewman Tamaki, who is heat tolerant.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.620
--Once again, I survive for no reason! --Are you serious?

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.710
--Once again, I survive for no reason! --Oh, God...

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.750
What do we do, then?

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.170
We are Fire Soldiers!

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.840
If this saves the lives of all those people on the surface,

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.510
then I'm okay with it.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.840
Vulcan, say when!

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.600
Yeah, I'm on it!

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.100
Is that all right, Captain Obi?

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.310
Yeah. We'll find a way to survive this on our own.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.480
I don't want to die, either, so I'm thinking...

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.070
...if we can find a place in the Nether for the heat to escape through...

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.280
But without any data, this maze-like Nether is simply...

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.580
For my job, I memorized the maps of the Nether for the whole empire.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.500
If you include the caved-in facilities,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.250
then maybe there is enough space for the heat to escape.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.250
True, if we knew enough about the geography in here...

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.920
As for the flames themselves, there's geothermal dissipation...

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.880
If we can use that... There's no time!

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.970
I don't have time to explain, so I'll tell you what to do!

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.270
Brother...

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.520
You just focus on controlling the flames right now.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.310
You two being in sync will be crucial!

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.150
You have to follow the Nether's geography to where I tell you,

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.690
and navigate Maki-san's flame control there!

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.820
Got it!

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.240
The sensors are picking something up! Heat sources within 3km are spiking!

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.670
Blow!

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.300
It's started!

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.090
First, please change the direction of the shaped charge jet!

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.470
If we can redirect the blast wave, we can keep the facility from collapsing!

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.060
Once the jet is redirected, where should we lead the flames?!

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.360
Drive them down to the lower floors as much as you can!

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.360
Right!

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.820
I can arrest the flames. I won't let them have free rein.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.580
All the flames in the area...

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.080
...are under my control!

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.840
This is only the beginning. The real extermination of Tokyo is yet to come.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.560
Huh?

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.440
Maki, I'll direct you, so you just control them like I tell you to.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.270
Right.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.940
Flames can go through places where people can no longer pass.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.990
Keep on directing the flames to the deepest part of the Nether!

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.660
If there's a point where the walls have collapsed and bare earth is exposed...

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.960
...then we can avoid the flames' heat through geothermic dissipation.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.540
Geothermic dissipation?

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.760
We'll exploit the laws of nature that keep the ground's temperature

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.470
at a constant 18 degrees.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.930
Oh, now I get it!

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.050
--You hear that? We're chasing the flames into the ground. --Right!

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.930
Keep on pushing the heat source into the ground!

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:20.310
With brother and sister combining their abilities with geothermal laws...

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.270
...over a long enough time, the earth will cool off the flames for us!

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.540
It looks like it worked.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.080
Hinawa,

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.920
if Maki hadn't been here, we, along with the rest of Tokyo, would be in a crater.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.670
Maki is a role model for all Fire Soldiers.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.380
She is someone absolutely essential at the 8th.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.890
Your judgment was right on the money.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.100
Did we make it?

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.600
Brother, this is what my...

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.480
...this is what the 8th's job is.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.570
They failed?

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.120
Failed? I don't know what you were plotting,

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.500
but it looks like it was powerless in the face of Fire Soldier teamwork.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.920
Hey, Arthur, let's show him our teamwork, too!

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.170
"Non-self"

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.550
Non-self... How did you...?!

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.380
Teamwork...?

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.760
"Nirvana"

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.390
Nirvana...

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.850
I am delivered. You can no longer read my mind.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.980
My sword has attained the realm of the bodhisattvas.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.730
No, you're just not thinking anything.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.440
That has nothing at all to do with being a knight.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.530
Non-self: Without drawing the breath of life, a life-taking blow is struck.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.320
This strike, delivered unawares to even masters of breath-reading,

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.410
imparts a truly fatal blow.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.330
Hmph, villain. Die now.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.540
You didn't even hesitate.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.170
So the 8th has a ruthless professional, does it?

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:17.430
Perhaps I underestimated you somewhat without realizing it.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.390
Insects?!

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.100
D-Damn it!

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:30.980
Where's Giovanni?!

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.400
--Right here. --No, dumbass, I mean his head!

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.370
My research into the Insects has been productive.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.370
I took part in an Adolla Link.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.330
We'll meet again.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.040
Have all of your men been accounted for?

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.550
The damage was worse than I imagined.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.680
However, we're now aware of just how dangerous the White-Clad are.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.220
If Crewman Oze hadn't been here, the damage would have been far worse.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.890
Well, Brother?

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.150
Do you understand my-- the 8th's work a little better now?

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.690
Yeah, I guess.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.400
But he's no good! He only thinks of you as a meat shield!

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.910
Well, I guess it goes without saying now...

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.460
...but I want to return to the 8th.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.630
Indeed. Your ability is better suited for the Fire Force.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:41.640
It's not just my ability; my ambitions are a fit for the Fire Force!

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:47.100
I see. I'll start the paperwork to have you transferred back to the 8th.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.730
W-Were you testing me, sir?

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.770
I was concerned with whether a little princess like you...

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.780
...could fight against the ever-more-radical White-Clad.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.610
You did well today.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.240
Thank you very much, sir.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.790
Hey! You keep away from the Oze family!

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.880
The heat source readings have gone silent. We're out of the woods now.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.960
Search for the remains of those who have fallen in the line of duty.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.550
Find as many of them as you can.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.800
I will take the wounded and return with them...

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.220
...back to the surface.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.150
It sure is a relief to see the sun again.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.270
What Dr. Giovanni said bothers me.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.740
Only those who have an Adolla Burst or have been connected to Adolla

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.530
are capable of an Adolla Link?

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.120
If that's true...

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.250
He's more-or-less okay.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:52.960
He's lost his right hand and left leg, and is burned and cut up from head to toe,

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.880
but he's still alive. He's got the will to live of a potato.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.760
You really did manage to hang in there...

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.630
...until you were dug up.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.350
Crewman Kotatsu, it's thanks to you that Juggernaut survived.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.600
"Dramatic sting"
Thank you.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.900
I'm the one who really got rescued.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.730
If it weren't for Platoon Leader Hajiki and Crewman Noto, I...

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.190
...wouldn't be here right now...

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:24.870
If we didn't have the 8th's help, we might have all been wiped out.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.160
The military and the Fire Force can't afford to be so disconnected.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.250
Tokyo has to unite.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:35.750
I truly am glad that we made it through this without losing you young crewmen.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.550
Are you thinking about Maki?

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.760
Mm-hmm.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.300
As of today, she has gone back to the Fire Force.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.470
Are you still anxious about her?

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.350
I want to let my daughter do as she wishes...

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.810
...but I'm still worried about her.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:00.230
Maki's ability is a super power she got from her mother, after all.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.240
I'm not nearly that strong.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.160
Madoka-chan, when you quit the military to become a homemaker,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.120
did you also feel discontent about it?

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.500
It's all I can do to keep my own home safe.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.750
But Maki isn't like me.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.590
She may be our innocent, adorable little daughter around us,

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.590
but she has an incredibly powerful strength and will.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.640
Oh yes, and she gets that from you.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.180
Let's watch over our daughter together.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.320
Who are you calling a gorilla cyclops?!

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.860
"Platoon Leader" "Maki Oze"

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.110
At last, Maki-san has made platoon leader.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.200
Very impressive.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.580
When we don't even have a platoon?

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.910
Meaning what?

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.500
That nothing is different from before.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.040
Are you sure, 8th? You're okay with this?

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.880
"Fish Beat" "No squads, either"

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.680
It's like the 8th is playing Fire Force dress-up.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.390
It's nice and peaceful when they're all idiots, huh?

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.850
You're the one who recruited them.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.060
Still...

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.440
...they're the real deal.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.500
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.830
"Next time"

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.170
I'll try harder, too!

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:09.970
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 23, "Firecat."

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:13.510
"Episode 23: Firecat"

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:13.510
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.
