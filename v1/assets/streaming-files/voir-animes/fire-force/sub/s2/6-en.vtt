00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.746
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.240
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.340
...is death by fire.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.040
What is that pillar of ice?

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.840
What exactly is happening?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.550
It's scary!

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.680
You're the first person to ever deal any damage to me.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.730
I'm gonna lay another one on you!

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.280
Charon, it's time.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.056
The fires are out and the Fire Force can move around freely now.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.910
Just bring the Fifth Pillar with you.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.646
We're withdrawing.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.896
See you later! Adieu, Plasma Boy!

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.920
Hold it!

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.150
She used magnetism to brake her descent on the way down?

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.730
Hold it!

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.700
The Special Fire Force is taking that girl into protective custody!

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.126
Your name is Inca, right? If you use your power, you can slip out of those!

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.580
Come over to me!

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.960
"Episode 6: The Time to Choose"

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.920
I've already figured out your tactic in going after my counters.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.816
I won't fall for that trick again.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.180
What are you planning to do in your situation now?

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.826
He's right. Now that he knows how I'm attacking,

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.890
if I just charge in at him blindly, I'll be playing right into his hands.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.350
I have to take Inca and get her out of here somehow.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.376
Charon-sama, Haumea-sama's brainwaves toward us

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.320
telling us to get going aren't letting up. Let's go!

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.280
Inca! What are you waiting for! Come over here!

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.280
Use your power to get loose!

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.970
With a wave of my finger, I can make flames.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.920
By tracing those lines, I could even cause explosions.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.840
But right now, I don't see any.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.300
Which means that right now, I won't be producing any flames.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.260
I'm sure my ability must let me see visions of the future.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.456
It feels really weird deciding what to do now,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.310
when I already know the future outcome, but I'm sure I don't see anything.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.900
Which means that I'm going to go with these iffy guys without any resistance.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.636
My brother was also kidnapped by these people,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.580
and had his life turned upside down!

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.710
You're not with them, Inca!

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.686
That won't help. Persuade all you want, but I can see how I'll end up.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.316
I'll be revealed to be the Fireground Thief, and lose my freedom, right?

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.800
I'm going to be apprehended by either one or the other.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.706
I get it. If I take your hand,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.690
there are crimes that I'm going to have to answer for,

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.280
but I'll still have a life of safety waiting for me.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.980
On the other hand, if I go with these guys, my future will be...

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.516
Take me away.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.540
Hey!

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.226
♪ Danger, danger. ♪

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.486
Going with them seems like the more dangerous play.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.590
You gotta be kidding me! Take a look at this town!

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.510
This is what those White-Clad did so they could catch you!

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.600
There are people who wanted to live longer, but couldn't be saved!

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.810
And yet you're voluntarily letting it go to waste!

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.860
What do you take your life for?!

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.216
You think I care about that?!

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.086
Doesn't matter to me what happens to anyone else!

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.716
It's my life! It doesn't belong to anyone else!

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.056
Don't you compare it to the worthless lives of those around me!

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.516
It's my life! I don't consider this a waste!

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.766
How is it a waste?! This is why I enjoy the thrill of exposing myself to danger!

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.090
To feel the joy of life out of the fear of losing it!

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.546
I don't care how much other human debris might croak,

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.390
I am going to preserve my own life.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.600
It's just like you say, Mr. Fire Soldier. Life is precious.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.120
Let's go, Charon. Show me a good time, all right?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.040
You're taking me too damn lightly.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.380
Wait right there!

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.140
I am going to kill you!

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.656
That's far better than having you protect me, or take me into custody.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.800
In that case, by all means, come for me.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.060
I'll be waiting for you.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.440
Wait...

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.370
Is that what Inca would rather do?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.080
Does Sho prefer staying with the White-Clad, too?

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.670
No, that can't be true!

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.220
Took you long enough.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.930
So you're the Fifth Pillar, Inca Kasugatani?

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.890
Who is this?

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.640
Yikes. Looks like I could short out just by touching her.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.650
We're getting out of here, now.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.610
Hold it!

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.520
Panda!

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.226
How dare you kill my bro! You let Boss Inca go!

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.040
Boss Inca, hurry and come back over here!

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.280
Charon... Yeah, I'm on it.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.010
I can see it, so I have no choice.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.850
This isn't my decision.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.220
It's just how... "fate" would have it.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.070
Not me.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:09:01.430
Inca! Inca!

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.850
Come on, let's get going.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.686
Did we... make it?

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:35.060
It looks like the White-Clad people have retreated.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.390
Yeah, and just like that, the fires are under control, too.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.890
Stop!

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.730
All right, just set her down right there.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.666
Are you all right, Shinra?

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:53.690
Yes, sir.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.410
But the Fifth Pillar has been taken away by the Evangelist's men.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.170
I am terribly sorry.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.400
Haumea said that there were eight people who possessed Adolla Bursts.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.340
Eight Pillars... plus the Evangelist.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.710
We don't know a thing.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.986
We have too little information, and we don't know what their whole objective is.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.756
As long as we're in the dark,

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.080
we'll always be behind the curve, just like we always have been.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.996
I'd like to investigate more, to find out exactly what they're after.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.480
You're right. We need to find some clues about Adolla Bursts.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.880
It's becoming clear what we need to do.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:44.810
Also, Arthur and Shinra, you both did a good job out there today.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.660
Good, doesn't look like there are any problems.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.186
Guys! We're ready! Hop on in!

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.150
Yeah, all right!

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.640
Thank you!

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.406
...Thank you! ...Thank you very much!

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.946
...Thanks for your hard work! ...We're all safe now, thanks to you!

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.726
Thank you so much!

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.770
...Thank you! ...You saved us!

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:19.240
Captain Hague from the 4th said that he thought he'd saved so many people,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:25.080
but in fact, there were so many lives that he couldn't save.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.250
And I was so pleased, too,

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.760
the first time I heard their praise...

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.930
Even if there had been no Evangelist,

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.600
could I have saved Inca, in any real sense?

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.650
"Special Fire Station 4"

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.926
Reporting in, sir. The casualties from yesterday's fire...

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.306
...were 19 dead, 58 injured.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.266
We counted 134 buildings lost to the fire.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.560
Also, the number of Infernals that were put to rest came to 39.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.936
I'm glad the casualties were kept as low as they were,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.180
compared to the Great Fire two years ago.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:31.430
Still, it pains me that the 4th's assistance came as slow as it did.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.706
"Special Fire Grand Cathedral 1"

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.206
I understand that the 8th is already taking anti-Evangelist action.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.190
That sounds like Obi, all right.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.280
Unlike the 1st, with our Holy Sol Temple discipline tying our hands,

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.250
they don't seem to have any hardheaded cardinals over there.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.730
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.690
Is the 1st going to work with them?

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.736
Karim appears to have been sneaking over to the 8th already,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.240
and Tamaki is there, too, under the pretext of being suspended.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.670
I don't think we can do any more.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:13.116
Were all of the fires the other day started by artificial means?

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.090
Yeah. The same group responsible for your arm and Rekka.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.010
I didn't get to pay them back for that.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.240
My right arm is like a trial bestowed upon me by God.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.346
So don't get too worked up. Even without my right arm,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.810
I don't have any trouble doing things, except for tenting my hands.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.750
Besides...

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.396
Return to the great flame of fire.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.670
...Látom...Látom.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.196
...you're here to help me with that.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.126
Don't make me do that!

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.740
I already feel responsible!

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.446
"Special Fire Base 2"

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.760
Oh! It's burning! It's burning!

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.826
Captain Honda, are you saying that arrangements for the imperial garrison

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.270
are being provided by the 2nd?

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.786
It will make things easier for the 2nd to make the arrangements,

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.246
given our close ties with the military.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:01.916
"Takeru"

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.200
Besides, we have a rookie here who's from the peninsula.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.600
Have him help them out.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.406
Whoo, I haven't performed ablutions in a long time.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.526
You're doing well.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.560
Oh, no, you are.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.996
You're the only sister here at the 8th, Iris.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.230
There's no telling when you'll need another sister again,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.530
so I need to keep myself pure at all times, so I can be of help to the 8th.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.110
Nya!

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.030
Whoa, I can see right through that.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.016
Nya! Screw you!

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.176
Látom.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.370
Not at all.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.500
So you're going?

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.856
Mm-hmm. I'm going to go see it with my own eyes.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.400
But wow, am I ever busy. I'm at a loss as to what I should take with me.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:17.390
I'd like to go with you, but the checkpoints are pretty strict.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.140
You should have become a Fire Soldier, Joker.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.120
Not a bad idea.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.030
I worked with Captain Hibana of the 5th, and we made an educated guess.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.490
I'm actually going to go there and see for myself.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.500
I turned over my data.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.790
I do hope they find some lead on Adolla Bursts,

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.606
but as a scientist, I'd like to go along with them.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.430
I hate that in my position as captain, I can't do so.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:00.980
We're going to be carrying out a joint operation with the other companies.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.690
The 8th will be sending four of its crewmen.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.650
That will be you four.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.860
A joint operation? What are we doing?

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.320
I need you to conduct an investigation into the Evangelist and Adolla Bursts.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.466
The White-Clad are gathering what they call the Eight Pillars,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.030
who each carry an Adolla Burst.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:26.436
There are those, like Shinra and his brother, who are already known,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.146
but, like Inca the other day,

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.680
it is also conceivable that new ones will come about.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.390
Currently, we have identified four of them... Shinra, Sho, Inca, and Haumea.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.116
The purpose for the Evangelist's people

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.960
to gather the Eight Pillars and their Adolla Bursts...

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.210
...is to once again trigger the Great Cataclysm from 250 years ago.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.990
It was a disaster whose effects were so great, they ended up redrawing the world's maps.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.606
I don't know why they want to have that happen again,

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.210
but we have to prevent it, whatever it takes.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.986
There's too much we don't know about what happened

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.800
during the Great Cataclysm of the past.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.156
The way things stand, we are always a step behind

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.576
when it comes to safeguarding Adolla-Burst-bearing Pillars.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.616
Which is why we are forming a research team

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.230
and investigating the Great Cataclysm of the past.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.430
Incidentally, I've already narrowed down the point we're investigating.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.700
Where are we going, sir?

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:39.030
To a place of yet-unknown terrain, and an unknown ecology.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.420
A place that's seriously unknown.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.460
That place is the Chinese Peninsula!

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.566
Outside the Tokyo Empire.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.670
"Operation Chinese Landing"

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.460
The sea!

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:07.310
We're about to leave Tokyo! I wonder what the outside world is like.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.610
We're going to go aboard that and cross the ocean!

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.120
Kusakabe! Fall in!

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.330
Sorry, sorry!

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.016
Is everyone here? I'm taking roll call.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:31.856
"4th, Second Class" "Team Leader" "Ogun Montgomery"
"2nd, Second Class" "Navigator" "Takeru Noto"

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.436
"8th, Second Class" "Escort (Knight)" "Arthur Boyle"
"8th, Second Class" "Escort (Hero)" "Shinra Kusakabe"

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.106
"8th, Second Class" "Sister, Prayers" "Tamaki Kotatsu"

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.486
"8th, Science Officer" "Investigation" "Viktor Licht"

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.150
"4th, Lieutenant" "Commander" "Purt Co Pan"

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.470
The seven of us will be carrying out this mission.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.236
As you know, the purpose of this investigation

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.730
is to find clues about the Evangelist and Adolla Bursts.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.260
And then, when we do, we, the Special Fire Force, will...

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.330
No, you have to say the important part out loud, sir.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.966
All right, take care.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.596
Most of them are former students of mine from the Training Academy,

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.860
so there won't be any problems.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.140
Crewman Kotatsu...

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.146
Juggernaut, your family lives on the Chinese Peninsula, right?

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.470
Mm-hmm. I come from one of the potato farms there.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.406
That's why I was assigned to be the guide.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.116
But I've never been to the area where our destination is,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.576
so honestly, I'm not too sure about this.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.520
You'll do fine. We're counting on you.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.456
So this is what it's like inside.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.216
Huh? These are our potatoes!

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.700
"Noto Farms Potatoes"

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.256
You can grow potatoes even in a wasteland?

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.660
Mm-hmm, that's right.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.306
Potatoes are plants than can produce a high yield even in harsh soil.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:51.370
Oh, yeah?

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.606
The green skin and buds have solanine and chaconine, which are poisonous,

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.526
so you need to watch out for those,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.736
but they're rich in nutrients and vitamin C, your B-complexes,

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.090
...Peek... ...potassium and dietary fiber, so they're very healthy!

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.406
You don't say...

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.576
You can get about 15 grams of the starch that potato starch is made from

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.286
out of around 100 grams of potatoes.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:11.416
If you're counting calories, it's only 76 of those.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.706
You can burn that off with 30 minutes of walking.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.206
Also, the potato plant's flowers are really pretty.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.416
...They can be white, or light purple, ...Sneak, sneak, sneak...

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.796
...and just looking at them can make you really happy, you know? ...Sneak, sneak, sneak...

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.506
Sure can.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.796
Oh, and another thing, did you know that potatoes are actually...

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.256
You startled me!

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.990
What are you doing down here? We're about to shove off.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.726
They said we were free to use the ship's cabins until we arrive.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:37.060
Sensei will... I mean, I will go pay my respects to the captain.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.146
Go inform the others.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.550
...Roger...Roger.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.106
Do you think we can go up on deck?

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.076
It's under Imperial Armed Forces control,

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.560
so if we scamper around too much, we might make nuisances of ourselves,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.180
but let's head up there once we depart.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.120
Make sure you do what Lieutenant Pan tells you to do!

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.330
...Yes, sir! ...Yes, sir!

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.290
...Here we go! ...Here we go!

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.720
We're about to go outside of Tokyo!

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:46.430
Whoa, awesome! We're surrounded by ocean!

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:49.756
What's that?

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.580
An undersea volcano, I'll bet.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.250
An undersea volcano?

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.380
It must have been formed in the Great Cataclysm 250 years ago.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.790
The Great Cataclysm...

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.560
This investigation is going to look into what happened in the Great Cataclysm.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.900
"To be continued"

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.386
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.620
"Next time"

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.050
On a new mission, they leave the Tokyo Empire for the Chinese Peninsula.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.300
There, they run into mysterious creatures in unknown territory.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.680
Aw, I wish I could have gone, too.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.850
Whoa, holy crap! I can see it now!

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.616
"Episode 7" "Road to the Oasis"

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:23.396
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 7, "Road to the Oasis."

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.370
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.
