WEBVTT

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.940
It's stretched out all over!

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.530
If the White-Clad are here,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.160
then their objective is probably to secure the Adolla Burst.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.580
If so, then is the best course of action to team up with Haijima,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.790
and get out of this three-way battle situation?

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.590
I'll punish you on Sol's behalf!

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.860
Oh? That didn't work?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.150
What, you mean it's insulated?

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.620
Haumea, get back.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.240
Tch, you keep out of this!

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.090
This... is too much.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.130
If I don't maintain some space, she has the upper hand.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.220
But she's matching me step for step; I can't shake her!

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.220
Not only am I not outdistancing her, she's overtaking--

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.850
What are you doing, Arrow?! You are seriously pathetic!

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.240
--Sorry. --And you call yourself a protector?

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.370
Usually, the pillar-protector buddy system goes Commander Sho and me,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.950
and Charon and you, Haumea.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.910
We were paired up on the premise that we were good matches for each other,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.500
and breaking that up is why we are out of sync--

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.550
I'll give you a full-body vibrating massage, so let's be friends!

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.640
It looks like electricity is coursing through her whole body.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.270
If we get close to them, we'll get shocked.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.440
I don't want to hear any of your excuses, Arrow.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.570
Protect me right, or I'll kill you.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.740
How nice!

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.280
My generator is getting all warmed up. It's going to be worth punishing you!

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.040
Charon will be capturing the Sixth Pillar any minute.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.410
Arrow, stop standing there looking moody.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.710
Let's go nuts on them!

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.260
If that plasma lady uses her toxic EM waves, it's all over!

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.800
The plasma density in this whole area is rising. I have to hurry!

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.260
Arthur! Where are you?!

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.060
WALK!

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.310
SNAP!

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.770
Where's Nataku?!

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.440
--Let me go! --Stop squirming!

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.860
That's right, the kid's over there. You bad guys fight over him!

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.120
You're coming here?!

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.290
Out of my way.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.330
Let me take care of those weak-looking ones first.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.790
Don't you care about Nataku?!

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.380
I already told you, where possible, I like to fight the weak.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.100
CLAP!

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.390
This is a hell of a situation! Shinra!

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.430
Get Nataku!

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.270
Yes, sir!

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.520
Let's get going.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.480
You aren't getting away!

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.190
What do we do? Should we get in there, too?

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.490
No, just wait, Ritsu. Someone will die before long.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.780
You won't lack for raw materials.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.500
Thanks to your power, Miss Inca, I can use my ability all I like.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.920
Danger, danger, danger will get you killed. Show them, Ritsu...

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.510
...the spell that lets you toy with people.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.980
"Episode 16: Mind Blown"

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.360
Damn...

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.120
You are quite the pain-in-the-ass opponent.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.540
--Aren't there any other, more reasonable opponents?

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.330
--Let me go! Let me go! --Aren't there any other, more reasonable opponents?

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.710
What is this black smoke?

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.840
"Soul Eclipse"

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.970
--I feel hot all over...! --Wah! Too hot! Too hot!

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.270
Burn from the inside out with my superheated soot.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.940
Nice weakness.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.000
Secured!

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.620
You have nothing to worry about now, Nataku-kun!

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:39.500
"S--"

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.540
"Snatch!"

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.750
Sixth Pillar, you are not to leave me.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.550
That's an educational bear. The boy belongs to Haijima.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.760
A bear?!

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.890
--Got him! --Got him!

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.180
Don't get in the way, Arthur! I've got him!

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.390
Shut up, Devil! You're gonna scare the kid!

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.320
Rebound!

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.950
That's a foul!

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.450
Come on! Hey, hey!

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.500
--Press him! Like we did in practice! --Mm-hmm, this is perfectly good raw material.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.330
--We just need to get one sure basket! --Mm-hmm, this is perfectly good raw material.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.420
Now I just need an Infernal for the base.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.420
There's the perfect person for the job.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.970
I'm going to make you bigger.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.390
An Infernal?!

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.400
Necro Pyro.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.030
"Necro Pyro"

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.870
She's raising those bodies?!

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.580
That is one nasty power.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.790
The corpses are attacking the Infernal!

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.800
Oh, God!

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.220
Come, come, great flaming one.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.400
I-It's a... ...giant Infernal!

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.030
That Infernal that appeared back in Ueno--

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.320
that was due to this woman's ability?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.410
She's making playthings of those people's bodies!

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.950
This one has a fighter as its base,

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.620
so it's a lot stronger than that earlier, misbegotten one.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.880
Yes, Kurono.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.880
Mr. President!

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.930
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I was focusing on the weaker ones...

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.690
Idiot? Me? Yes, sir.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.860
The boy with the Adolla Burst has been incorporated into a giant Infernal--

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.450
Well, yes, sir. Which is why I was giving priority to the weaker--

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.280
Sir? Idiot? Do you mean me, sir?

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.580
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.830
Understood. Goodbye, sir.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.470
Honestly, being a salaryman is rough.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.690
This is no time for the two of us to be quarreling.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.520
Let's get Nataku back.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.320
I'll help you.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.910
Hey, Arrow, you keep that corporal-punishment biddy occupied.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.750
I have business with the Sixth Pillar.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.170
And if you mess up this time, I will kill you for reals, understand?

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.960
I understand.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.550
No running off without permission!

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.020
You really are a pesky girl!

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.900
That's him? What a lame face he has.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.570
I'll give you a hand, so let's get you even higher!

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.500
That's right. Children are supposed to imagine.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.210
They imagine whatever they dream.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.170
Take fire! You're incredible! Try hard!

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.050
My mental imagery... My imagination...

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.140
My imagination... is infected...

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.110
The madman inside me is stoking me up.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.230
My stars!

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.280
My hopes are up, while my feelings are down.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:26.160
The madman is stoking me from the bottom upward.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.460
Upward, upward... together with the thick smoke...

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.580
...heading toward my hopes...

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.010
--My hopes are up... --That's it! That's it! That's so it!

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.470
--Is that true, though? --Keep going higher! I know you can do it!

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.550
--The smoke I'm heading into makes it so hard to breathe. --Keep going higher! I know you can do it!

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.510
--The smoke I'm heading into makes it so hard to breathe. --Just keep it up!

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.640
--My hopes are up... --That's it! That's it! That's so it!

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.100
--...while my feelings are down... --That's it! That's it! That's so it!

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.180
--...while my feelings are down... --Keep going higher! I know you can do it!

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.350
--I'm about to suffocate... --Keep going higher! I know you can do it!

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.310
--I'm about to suffocate... --Keep doing what you're doing! Keep at it!
--Keep doing what you're doing! Keep at it!

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.730
--I'm about to suffocate... --Keep doing what you're doing! Keep at it!

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.770
--I'll be waiting for you!

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:59.110
--I'm really about to suffocate... --I'll be waiting for you!

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.530
I'm going to suffocate...

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.620
...on my infected imagination...

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:21.380
You all can suffocate together with my hopes!

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.890
What's suddenly come over him? Has he lost his mind?

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.480
Haumea, you did something, didn't you?

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.820
"Motor Head."

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.570
I goosed the amount of dopamine and beta-endorphins his brain produces

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.570
to provoke a little pressure and excitement.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:49.280
He's already predisposed to it. This won't break anything.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.040
The "Infected Imagination" he has

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.710
is a manifestation of the pressure he's always felt.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:59.630
All of you, suffocate!

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.760
"Infected Imagination"

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.520
Hey, man, are you kidding me?!

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.360
Captain, this is bad! Get away from there, right now!

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.110
Is that you, Vulcan?! What's wrong?!

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.450
Radiation readings are climbing above baseline.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.080
Those of you who are unpowered should evacuate!

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.330
Sister, Licht, you're with me!

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.120
That shock lady has gone and done something!

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.790
We need Arthur to counter her!

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.880
As soon as I pick up Arthur, I'm heading to you!

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.840
Arthur! Arthur, where are you?!

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.890
High-ho Silver!

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.850
Fine, I'm Silver. We need your help!

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.480
How far away should we be from the radiation source?

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.320
Unpowered people should still be all right if they keep 200 meters away.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.530
But the pyrokinetics who are fighting in all that are in incredible danger.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.410
The source of the radiation is a third generation's ability.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:19.000
Those of us who are pyrokinetics should still be okay.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.880
But even so, if the radiation keeps getting stronger, we'll be in danger!

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.550
Ritsu, what happened to your giant?

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.890
Miss Inca, it's too dangerous for you to come down here.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.140
There's no way it can hit me.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.770
Haumea tampered with the Sixth Pillar's brain.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.310
Those heat rays appear to be radioactive.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.110
Radiation? That's bad news.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.730
So Miss Inca, you should--

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.690
Oh, you'll die if you stay there.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.820
Huh? Really?

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.950
--How are we supposed to retrieve the Sixth Pillar like this?

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:55.160
--Holy cow! --How are we supposed to retrieve the Sixth Pillar like this?

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.540
That was fantastic, Haumea-chan!

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.670
Damn that Haumea, wreaking havoc unnecessarily...

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.670
That giant Infernal is suddenly tearing the place up.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.340
Kurono, we have to stop Nataku!

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.510
I don't see any other way. We'll kill him.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.260
You'd kill a pyrokinetic that's vital to Haijima?!

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.390
--You call yourself a Haijima employee?! --Who're you, my boss?

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.560
Stop thinking only about hurting others, and start thinking about your job!

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.600
Who're you, my boss?

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.940
We'll destroy the giant parts, and pluck Nataku out of there.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.030
Let's go!

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.700
It's hard!

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.130
Kurono! I'll draw the lasers away and create a window for you!

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.420
You go and--

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.510
That's strong.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.350
It's gotten too strong.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.020
Time for a new job.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.610
--Seriously, why does it have to be so strong?

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.440
--Hey! What are you waiting for?! I thought you were going to help! --Seriously, why does it have to be so strong?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.530
--Hey! What are you waiting for?! I thought you were going to help! --Weaker is so much better.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.820
Oh, crap!

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.170
Charon!

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.960
It's my calling to protect the Pillars!

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.970
So I'll protect you.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.520
I'll cover you.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.560
You use your speed to get close and pull the Sixth Pillar out of there!

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.270
I don't need you protecting me to do that!

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.240
Men are still little boys at heart,

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.280
so why do they insist on getting stronger for no reason?

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.040
You're incredible! You have incredible power! Let them have it!

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.290
You can do it, you can do it! You can do it if you try!

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.750
We're still all right now,

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.960
but if the radioactive concentration keeps rising,

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.220
we really will be in trouble.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.390
Damn, there isn't a second to spare!

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.010
I have to hurry and get Arthur there!

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.720
What are you having me do, and where?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.890
I need to you become a legendary knight.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:30.230
What did you say? A legendary knight?!

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.360
--A knight, you say? Legendary, you say?

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.190
--Take it easy! --A knight, you say? Legendary, you say?

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.200
--Watch it! Don't thrash around! --Where, Vulcan?! Where are we going?!

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.030
There's a place where you can become a legendary knight!

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.040
Where is it?! Hurry up and take me there!

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.590
Yeah! Very knightly!

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.590
This is the top of the Matchbox.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:59.010
You're not trying to trick me again, like that time with Sil-burro, right?

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.930
You make it sound so scandalous. Just trust me!

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.230
Can you see the hole in the middle of the hatch?

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.520
Yeah, right there.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.360
You're going to stick your Excalibur into that hole.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.030
You've heard the tale of the legendary knight

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.990
who inserts his legendary sword into something, right?

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.670
The tale of the sword-inserting legendary knight?!

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.250
Beneath that hole is a machine

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:38.880
that will take the plasma emitted by Arthur's Excalibur and amplify it.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.220
If that amplified plasma can disrupt the shock lady,

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:48.100
we should have a pseudo-pulse attack that will shut out her EM waves.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.770
Hold on! You have it backwards!

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.770
The legendary knight pulls his sword out of something!

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.860
Tch, he knows too much about this.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.820
So all you have to do is stick it in first,

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.070
and then pull it out!

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:04.330
Huh? Vulcan, what are you talking about? Are you dense?

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:08.580
You're the one who's dense! You're carrying a legendary sword right now!

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.500
But you aren't pulling your sword out of anything!

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.340
In other words, once you stick your sword in, then you can pull it out!

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.670
Are you going to let this chance get away from you?!

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:24.470
Oh, right... S-So what you mean is...

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.520
...this trinket I've been carrying around

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.520
turns out to actually be a legendary weapon?

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.060
Yeah, that's it!

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:37.530
Trinket? Just what kind of status does Excalibur have in Arthur's mind?

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.360
Arthur's mindset is so squishy, it's hard to get a handle on it.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.280
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm!

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.910
And I'll be a legendary knight?

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.410
--Yes! --I get it!

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.950
I understand!

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.080
Thank goodness you're so dumb!

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.590
"Electromagnetic Pulse"

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.960
Electromagnetic Pulse!

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.550
"Amplification"

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.430
Amplification!

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.900
Those bastards! I'll bet it's that plasma user.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.900
Vulcan and Arthur have done it!

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.570
This is the interference wave you mentioned?

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:24.320
Arrow! My toxic EM waves have been blocked!

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.580
We're gonna clobber the guy jamming me and get that kid to rampage again!

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.910
I actually think it's better if she remains blocked.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.590
Oh, no you don't!

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:41.590
But I can't activate the Tekkyo because of that EM pulse.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:48.180
I understand the situation. We just need to stop that naughty girl, right?

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.020
Your puppet can still move?

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:55.190
My Dominions run on flame, not electricity.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.230
There he is!

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.450
Stay out of this!

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.570
We've been made!

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.240
Vulcan, I can pull it out now, right?

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.620
Not yet! The sword you're holding is a legendary sword!

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.620
They don't come out that easily!

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.840
Oh, okay. By the way, Vulcan,

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.920
why does the stone with the sacred sword in it have a driver's seat?

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.550
What is this?! The stone shouldn't start moving, should it?!

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.720
EMP intensity declining.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.020
Damn, Arthur's make-believe knighthood is starting to fade!

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.020
Arthur! It turns out the stone the sword is stuck in

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.860
is actually the back of a big snake! Don't get shaken off!

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.070
A giant serpent?!

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.950
That's right! Look closely! Extreme technique:

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.080
Sidewinder!

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.120
"Sidewinder"

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.330
It sounded like something just whizzed by us.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.040
I missed.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.130
Why, you giant serpent!

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.800
You think that you can shake off the Knight King Arthur,

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.800
but you shall not!

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.720
The legendary sacred sword will remain in place!

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.480
Radioactive concentration still climbing.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.310
Shinra...

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.480
...do something now, while there's still time!

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.900
"To be continued"

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.410
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.540
"Next time"

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.630
Nataku-san is swallowed up inside the giant Infernal, and not in his right mind.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.630
The radiation grows ever stronger,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.090
until finally, we are all placed in the greatest peril!

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:14.680
Someone, someone, please stop him!

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.220
You dumbass!

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:28.440
"Episode 17: Boys, Be Weak"

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:24.360
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 17, "Boys, Be Weak."

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.440
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.
