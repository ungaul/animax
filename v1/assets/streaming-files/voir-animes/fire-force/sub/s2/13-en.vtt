00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.790
Sure enough, if I'm going to get those scriptures,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.460
I'm going to have to defeat you first, aren't I?

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.630
You kept yourself quiet and out of sight all this time,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.220
but now you've taken some rather bold action.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.470
I couldn't stand having the truth being hidden any longer.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.980
Bring it.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.370
Everything I've had, I've lost,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.660
but I won't let go of this remaining spark

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.250
No, I won't let it go, not ever

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.840
Though there may be no right answers in my ill-defined tale,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.010
once I'm able to step forward...

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.680
They say something's wrong with me, but I'll do something with them

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.650
I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.280
But if my dreams have resolved themselves to be by your side

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.320
then there's nothing left for me to doubt anymore

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.160
Sparks fly as things kick off

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.990
until "black and white" turns to ashen gray

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.910
If there's a choice crown to be had

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.790
I want it, I want it I'll whizz my way toward you

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.710
until "double or nothing" gets zeroed out

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.510
If the clowns are melancholy

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.340
then nothing will get anywhere

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.680
I'll show you a love that burns hot enough to scorch ashes

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.310
I just spark again

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.490
"Episode 13: A Pair of One-Eyes"

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.120
I'll take a piece of that fight.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.250
Sounds interesting.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.620
Captain Shinmon...

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.750
What's the matter? Are we doing this?

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.930
This is no time for us to be quarreling. Let me hear what you have to say.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.220
Hey!

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.890
Don't go looking at Mr. Almighty here and lose your nerve.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.850
I've always thought that among all the captains,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.980
you're one who would give me a run for my money.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.070
Apparently Haijima has a real piece of work, too.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.990
If you're not going to fight, then why are you here?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.240
You're here looking for Holy Sol Temple secrets, right?

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.790
I'm here to give you some leads.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.580
Leads?

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.620
I don't understand what's happening.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.920
What is the captain of the 1st doing here?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.880
For that matter, you two know each other?

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.920
Burns was someone who acted as a liaison

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.550
between the Holy Sol Temple's public and private faces.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.020
He used to look after me a lot once upon a time.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.560
At least until the time we had our Adolla Link.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.360
Adolla Link? Shinra from the 8th mentioned the same thing.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.820
It happened when there was a mass outbreak of Infernals at Amaterasu.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.780
There was an incident at Amaterasu?

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.910
I never heard of anything as major as that.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.870
Of course not. Amaterasu has to be seen as safe.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.960
This isn't something that could be made public.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.170
Which is exactly the reason why pariahs like us were called in.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.140
There's one left.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.720
The other Shadows will have taken down all the others.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.020
The target is in there.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.270
There it is.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.610
I'll take it.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.400
Wait. Something's off.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.900
Not a problem!

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.380
Burns, what's going on in the outside world?

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.930
Human combustion is still happening, right?

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.180
Yes, it is. Infernals are still popping up.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.060
So it sucks both on the surface, and in the Nether.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.310
The world is filled with sorrow, and seeks the salvation of Sol.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.820
So simply turning to God in prayer will save it?

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.280
No, I don't want to rely on anything, nor am I seeking salvation.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.120
I'm looking for something more clear-cut than that.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.420
The ill will of this world... Religion... Government...

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.540
Those who manipulate the goodwill of people to their own advantage

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.460
lead the world to suck even more.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.800
I want to know what the world is. Why does the world suck?

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.760
I want to see the truth!

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.820
A higher dimension... The world... Truth... Laws...

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.490
Insects... Mathematics...

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.200
Hell...

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.120
God...

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.220
52!

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.510
My eye!

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.100
Are you okay, 52?!

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.560
Was that... a hallucination?

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.150
What did we... just see?

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:33.160
That was no hallucination. We were pulled into a different space.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.450
Look at this.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.370
That world...

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.420
...actually exists!

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.300
Do you still have that stone?

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.100
The stone you brought back from Adolla?

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.520
It still continues to burn inside an oxygen-free jar, even now.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.100
That higher-dimensional being we saw back then--

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.480
the Holy Sol Temple is hiding something huge about that one.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.950
The clues to the truth you want to learn...

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.160
...are in here.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.450
Take a look through it.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.660
What is it?

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.250
The notebook of the wife of Raffles I, founder of the Holy Sol Temple.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.670
His wife's notebook? I came here looking for hidden scriptures.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.260
Nothing like that exists.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.380
How would you know that?

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:38.600
Because like you, I have looked into the Holy Sol Temple for a long time.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.020
Ever since the day of our Adolla Link.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.980
That world shattered all of my perceptions.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.280
It made me skeptical toward this world,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.570
and I started investigating to learn the truth.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.660
What I arrived at as a result of that investigation...

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.870
...is this single book.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.080
I used my position as captain of the 1st

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.000
and started looking into everything.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But there was nothing inside the church

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.050
that connected to the Holy Sol Temple's past.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:19.010
This book... ...is something I stumbled upon by chance

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.430
while investigating the forgotten Nether.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.190
And you say it belonged to the wife of Raffles I?

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.280
The contents of the book

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.650
are a diary from the Day of the Cataclysm

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.780
until the Holy Sol Temple and empire were established.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.910
It has a detailed account of the founder, Raffles I.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.000
The description of the establishment of the Tokyo Empire

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.970
is the same one that all of us citizens know, as appears in the scriptures.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.840
The writing says that a caravan centered around Raffles I

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.600
discovered an Adolla Burst after a long journey,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.100
and built Amaterasu, which would become the core of the empire.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.230
So it's just like the scriptures say,

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.940
and the Holy Sol Temple isn't hiding anything, is that what you're saying?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.980
Come off it.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.990
That isn't what you should be focusing on.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.950
It's the way Raffles I was acting, as seen by his wife.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.120
"The caravan that was traveling with Raffles

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.910
had been completely wiped out when he returned."

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.750
"I was happy that at least Raffles had returned home safely.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:38.590
But ever since he came back, he's been acting like he's a different person."

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.140
"Though his appearance is unchanged,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.060
his mannerisms and idiosyncrasies have been as though he was another man.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.600
I can scarcely believe that he is the same man

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.440
that I have been married to for 30 years," she says.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.820
No matter how great a shock he received from the experience,

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.330
would it change his mannerisms and idiosyncrasies to those of another man?

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.910
Seems like I've heard this tale before.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.370
Hmm?

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.960
In Asakusa, there was someone with the ability

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.500
to turn himself and others into dead ringers for other people.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.710
That just happened recently, though.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.680
We're talking 250 years ago for this.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.840
Infernals have no life expectancy.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.930
It's possible that this being, like the Evangelist,

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.190
is an inhuman, higher-dimensional being.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.610
The Holy Sol Temple could be a religion that was set up

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.530
by an inhuman being who had taken Raffles's place.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.240
Then that's all the more reason to tear this religion down now!

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.290
Just a minute. Are you sure we can even trust that book?

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.040
Its origins notwithstanding,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.750
the fact is that the Holy Sol Temple now offers emotional support to the people.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.510
Bringing it down would create chaos.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:04.680
First the caravan is wiped out, then Raffles I comes back changed.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.980
That's assuming this diary is accurate, like you say it is.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.520
Do the current Holy Sol Temple folks know about this?

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.740
It's likely that the current emperor, Raffles III, doesn't know.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:26.450
No one knows the truth about what happened 250 years ago.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.830
Which means that even if we keep searching the Holy Sol Temple,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.590
there won't be anything connecting to the Evangelist.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.670
Huh? Yona?!

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:47.560
You turned yourself into Raffles I and created the Holy Sol Temple?

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:53.190
That's right. The Raffles I you read about in the scriptures was me.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.780
The Holy Sol Temple is a religion I started under the Evangelist's order.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.490
All to manipulate human will to our advantage,

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.530
and lead them to Adolla.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.950
All by the grace of the Evangelist.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.620
I'll make today's little incident go away.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.000
Yeah.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.880
Though I have to say, Captain of the 7th,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.090
you're an even bigger tough guy than I'd heard.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.260
I don't know what you mean by that,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.680
but back in Asakusa, that's a compliment.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.220
Luckily, you pulled your punches some, so the damage was minimal.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.940
Moreover, they were always hidden in the shadows.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.980
And only one dead. I should be able to keep this an internal matter.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.610
But what are you going to do now?

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.530
The truth is in the dark, just like the eye you lost.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.330
I can still see the truth with just one eye.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.960
Let's go, Almighty.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.250
There are still a whole lot of things I have to investigate.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.510
It sounds like you've decided what you're going to look into next.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.220
You could say that.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.470
"Haijima Industries"

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.850
Haijima Industries.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:13.390
Since they worked with the Holy Sol Temple to build Amaterasu,

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.690
there may be a connection to the Evangelist there.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.230
And you may learn who Raffles I really was.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.690
Still, when you say Haijima,

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.360
they have facilities all over the empire.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.620
You don't know where you should be looking.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.080
I guess that means hitting them one at a time.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.580
Haijima, huh? They make the medicine that Konro needs,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.670
so I can't go breaking in there.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.380
You didn't consider that given the ties between them and the Holy Sol Temple,

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.850
they might cut off his medicine after today's incident?

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.010
Not even a little bit.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.810
I'll take care of that, as well.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.100
In return, I want you to check out Haijima.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.440
In my position, I can't take any action against Haijima.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.990
"Haijima Industries"

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.410
These models lately have been giving us nothing but lousy results.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.790
That's for sure. This is a big waste of time.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.670
But you have that one with all S-ratings under your supervision, right?

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.580
I'd sure like to trade you for that one.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.090
Yeah, I envy you, too. Our models are all worse than scrap.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.760
Your model is that one child, right?

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.390
Yeah, the one Rekka Hoshimiya's Insect ignited--

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.560
Nataku Son.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.610
Sleepy... Good morning.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.740
G-Good morning!

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.920
The power source for the Chinese Peninsula's "Amaterasu" was a human.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.960
I can't believe we can't announce that to the public.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.920
'Sup, Shinra.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.010
'Sup, Vulcan.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.470
Breakfast, right?

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.430
My latest creation is in the kitchen. Go try it out.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.680
Latest creation?

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.140
Go and see. Give me your feedback after using it.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.230
What in the world did he make?

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.650
"Kitchen"

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.280
This is his latest creation?!

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.660
Oh damn, that is some exquisite craftsmanship!

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.660
But try it out? What am I supposed to do to try it out? Oh, damn...

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.460
Oh, damn...!

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.250
"Lisa"

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.380
This is the new creation!

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.300
A mixer?!

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:53.340
Ow... Huh? You're the real Lisa-san? Why are you here at the 8th?

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.760
I'm going to be staying here for a bit while I recuperate.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.310
Oh, sure! Lisa-san, you're more than welcome here!

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:05.940
I'm still with the Knights of the Ashen Flame, under the Evangelist.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.900
I may betray you once again.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.240
As long as you're at the 8th, you won't ever want to.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.820
Your opinion right now means very little.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.750
But, I will be in your care for a little while. Let's make the most of it.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.330
Welcome to the 8th!

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.540
Huh? This is Vulcan-san's newest creation?

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.760
Wh-What happens when I... press these buttons sticking out here?

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.050
You people...

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.390
To celebrate Lisa Isarabi-kun getting out of the hospital,

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.850
a toast, with protein smoothies!

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.770
--Cheers! --Cheers!

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.730
Want me to make you your own personal mechanical boobs?

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.820
Say, could someone hand me a tissue?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.200
Stop spilling that.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.830
This is pretty good, and not too sweet. Could we make these at our place?

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.620
I'm sure Waka would like them.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.250
You just blend the ingredients together. Anyone can make them.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.050
If I can ask, Lieutenant Konro, what brings you by so early?

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.180
The lieutenant is here to report on an investigation

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.760
that Captain Benimaru conducted on the Holy Sol Temple.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.310
It wasn't so much an investigation as a throw-down at the Imperial Seat.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.810
A throw-down?!

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.810
Mm-hmm, together with a suspicious man named Joker.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:32.280
Captain Shinmon... and Joker?

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.320
Why was this, now?

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.370
Huh?

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.920
The notebook of Raffles I's wife?

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.040
You're telling us that Raffles I, the one who founded the Holy Sol Temple,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.800
was an imposter who had taken his place?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.130
And that the current Holy Sol Temple doesn't know anything about it?

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.970
If so, then there's no sense in delving into the Holy Sol Temple anymore.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:06.770
There's plenty of room to question just how reliable this information is.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:07.810
Excuse me.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:08.810
If I may?

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.310
Sure.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.070
You may not believe what I say,

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.450
but there was no sign of the Evangelist having any connection with the Holy Sol Temple.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.620
Also--

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.290
Thank you for saying that. You don't have to push yourself.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.210
Let's go on out for a bit.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.720
Excuse me. I'm going to go take her to her room.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.010
Thanks.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.930
It seems more likely that Haijima, where Dr. Giovanni was,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.390
has some kind of connection to the Evangelist.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.270
But it will be difficult to investigate Haijima.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.730
What are you talking about? We just need to charge in there,

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.820
like Benimaru, and bowl them over.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.030
That would be too dangerous!

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.200
Where exactly are you planning to charge in, you dumb knight?!

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.370
What have you been listening to? Haijima, of course, you dumb devil!

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.870
--Die! --No, you die! --In other words, when you just say "Haijima,"

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.080
--You die first! --In other words, when you just say "Haijima,"

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.080
--No, you die first! --In other words, when you just say "Haijima,"
--No, you! --In other words, when you just say "Haijima,"

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.410
--No, you! --the company is involved with just about every industry in the Tokyo Empire.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.830
--the company is involved with just about every industry in the Tokyo Empire.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.250
When you include its subsidiaries,

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.210
its multiple enterprises have merged together, complementing each other,

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.670
and playing a key role in every business concern out there.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.840
Take clothing for example. Haijima is wrapped up in everything

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.310
from the materials needed to the design and production involved.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.680
As far as food goes, from contributing the raw materials,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.640
to providing the cookware and the storefronts,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.690
Haijima goods are there at every turn.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:39.360
Roughly 70% of the country's population works at a Haijima-related company.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.070
"Haijima-related: 70%" "All others: 30%"

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.400
Hmm...

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.200
Even the Fire Force is nominally a Haijima-related organization.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.120
Then am I a suspect, too?

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.830
Getting the complete picture on Haijima is hard to do, given its size.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.500
Plus, I have no idea how we would investigate them.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.300
Who do we know that's familiar with Haijima's inner workings?

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.720
Inspector Licht!

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:07.140
Come to think of it, where is Inspector Licht?

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.600
Apparently, he's been called in to none other than Haijima,

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.690
concerning his report on the Chinese Peninsula.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.690
Huh?

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.650
"Haijima Group, Haijima Paper Manufacturing Building"

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.700
Hey there, Captain Hibana. Hello.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.540
I read your report.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.580
You didn't need to touch on Amaterasu's power source,

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.420
or Haijima's abilities development, did you?

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.340
That's actually the reason why the president called me in.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.550
It's usually a mystery where he is.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.300
You're going to get eliminated.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.930
I thought you were a Haijima dog,

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.770
but then you go and bite your master's hand.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.690
What are you after?

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.270
"President's Office"

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.660
About your report...

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:13.370
Your job is to be our spy inside Special Fire Force Company 8, right?

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.870
"Haijima Industries President" "Gureo Haijima"

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.090
Yes, and to keep watch over Shinra Kusakabe.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.630
Even if this power generator thing on the Chinese Peninsula

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.090
did use a person possessing an Adolla Burst as its fuel source,

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:29.760
it's groundless to assert that the empire's Amaterasu is the same.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.270
Even worse, you can't possibly argue that this fuel source

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.350
and the company's charitable work in developing the pyrokinesis of orphans

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.360
are in any way linked!

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.360
It's all right.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.320
I asked you here today to do a job for us.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.780
Bring Shinra Kusakabe to our laboratory.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.000
All right, if you'll excuse me...

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.170
He has an overly inquisitive mind.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.920
Doing away with him would be the safe play.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.800
Luckily, he is unpowered. We can pass it off as human combustion.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.970
And if we do it on the premises, covering it up will be a simple matter.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.560
Very well.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:21.650
Once Viktor Licht brings Shinra Kusakabe here,

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.530
we'll kill him.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.500
Most incidences have their own name

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.380
But no one knows and I'm upside down

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.180
Billions of people exist

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.850
But not anybody tells me what that is

00:22:52.850 --> 00:23:00.520
Sacrificing my limited life Am I moving forward or not

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:07.650
I just want to believe Nothing goes to waste

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.030
I question myself Why I can't be who I want to be

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:17.660
tangled and translucent It drains me

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:23.000
Pretending and overextending myself

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.380
Wish one day I could love pathetic myself

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.430
Hoping for a dazzling future to come

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:35.060
Don't over decorate smile clumsily

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:42.480
Just live life the way I am This world is cruel

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.690
Can't choose how to be born

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:50.570
Stick up the middle finger then

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:55.410
Let's shoot off to the other side

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.500
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.580
"Next time"

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.340
The 8th ends up investigating Haijima Industries.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.800
The suspicious facility they make their way inside

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.170
has a patently dangerous-looking man.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:14.010
Huh? Shinra-san, you know this man?

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.470
I am ridiculously powerful against the weak.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:23.560
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 14, "The Ashen Reaper."

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:28.530
"Episode 14: The Ashen Reaper"

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.950
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.
