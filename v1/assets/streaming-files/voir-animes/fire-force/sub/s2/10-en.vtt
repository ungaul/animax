WEBVTT

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:21.490
Your call... has been... heard...

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.290
However... I only have...

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.840
If I were to give you Grace...

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.380
One second...

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.270
What can you do in a single second...?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.980
Such a small sliver of Grace would be... meaningless...

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.960
One second will be plenty.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.286
Everything I've had, I've lost,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.586
but I won't let go of this remaining spark

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.166
No, I won't let it go, not ever

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.756
Though there may be no right answers in my ill-defined tale,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.926
once I'm able to step forward...

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.606
They say something's wrong with me, but I'll do something with them

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.566
I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.196
But if my dreams have resolved themselves to be by your side

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.246
then there's nothing left for me to doubt anymore

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.076
Sparks fly as things kick off

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.916
until "black and white" turns to ashen gray

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.836
If there's a choice crown to be had

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.716
I want it, I want it I'll whizz my way toward you

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.636
until "double or nothing" gets zeroed out

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.426
If the clowns are melancholy

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.266
then nothing will get anywhere

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.606
I'll show you a love that burns hot enough to scorch ashes

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.260
I just spark again

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.010
"Episode 10: The Woman in Black"

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.150
Shinra, how long are you going to leave me hanging?!

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.070
Hurry it up!

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.450
With one second...

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.896
What can you do in one second?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.026
I can preserve this forest.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.776
I get a similar whiff from you as Adolla... As the Evangelist had.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.300
Who are you, exactly?

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.690
I am... no different than... the rest of you.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.376
You said that you came to restore this world.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.110
Then what is the Evangelist's objective?

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:51.530
Her... objective... is a terrible, arcane act.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.090
To fill this land with flame, and destroy everything.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.696
All I have done... is to create a land of rest...

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.940
...until the demise that is her goal... comes upon us.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.496
To destroy the earth with flames? It's just like Rekka said.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.280
Now, time is short. I will grant you my Grace.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.130
Ogun, sorry to keep you!

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.870
Through my Link with Grace, my body is broken down to the particle level.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.476
As I transcend the speed of light, time runs backward.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.130
My body, in particle form, returns to the way it was in the past.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.100
Are these...

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.730
...Tempe's memories?

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.126
Why am I the only one...?

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.740
The only one...

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.266
I lost all my wealth and property in the Great Cataclysm.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.726
I lost my wife and daughter at the same time.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.750
So why did I alone survive?

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.946
I hate it! I hate the Great Cataclysm!

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.350
I hate the Great Cataclysm for taking my status, my women, and my fortune!

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.650
I'm here.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.360
This is the spatial rift.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.136
It won't budge. Is there no way for me to move beyond here?

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.766
Does this mean that what lies ahead

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.090
is not a place where humans are permitted to enter?

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.406
Someone has appeared from beyond the rift!

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:05.980
A person! Wh... Who... What... are you?

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:17.176
A-Are you... G-God? God?!

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.886
The Evangelist...

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:25.396
God! Are you God?! You have come to grant me your blessing, right?

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.526
I've lost my position and money in the Great Cataclysm!

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.946
Please grant me that kind of joy once again!

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.736
Please, I pray of you!

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.076
Please, give me salvation!

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.350
Salvation...!

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:03.056
I have received God's blessing! It hurts! It burns! It is magnificent!

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:09.896
I will now become a god as well, and proclaim the greatness of God!

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.196
The Evangelist came through the spatial rift, too...

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.050
But this man Tempe here is beyond hope.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.270
Return to the great flame of fire!

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.256
Wh-What?

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.716
Where's the demon?

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.830
Shinra-kun is gone, too.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.056
Shinra took care of the demon in an instant?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.670
This is the true power of an Adolla Burst?

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.366
I got pretty far away from the forest, huh?

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.350
I'd better get back to the others.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.560
The Evangelist came from beyond the rift.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.520
Does that mean she isn't from this world?

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.296
Special Fire Force, you really did eliminate the demon in one second.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.766
I heard that you came from beyond the rift, too. I sense...

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.436
...the same kind of presence about you as the Evangelist has.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.226
Are you a being from Adolla as well?

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.106
You sense that because I have been inside the Tabernacle,

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.356
being burned for a long time by an Adolla Burst,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.366
which must have intensified the "presence" of Adolla.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.156
I was originally human.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.400
Just like you... and that demon, Tempe.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:59.506
I was enkindled with an Adolla Burst by an Evangelist's Insect,

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.700
and came to this world together with her.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.726
You want to know about the connection between myself and the Evangelist,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:18.750
but I am nothing more than someone who was brought here at her whim.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:26.326
All I did was merely repair the Tabernacle,

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:32.416
something which was already here 250 years ago.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:38.796
To save the animals that were living here from their agony,

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:46.820
I used its energy not to destroy, but to create, and made this Oasis.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.766
From ancient times, mankind has established many religions,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:11:00.340
envisioning different images of Heaven and Hell, God and the Devil.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.826
Though they grow up in different lands, and speak different languages,

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:16.850
for some reason, the religions of mankind all share gods and devils.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:23.546
If the various religions of this world...

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:28.830
are based on visions of Adolla that she has shown others...

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.356
...then perhaps from mind-bogglingly ancient times,

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.896
the Evangelist has been at work,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.696
manipulating the thoughts of mankind

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.366
from behind the scenes of history.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:53.376
One might say that the god that all mankind has imagined...

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.020
...is something that she conjured up.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:10.110
You are trying to go up against... the being who created... your God.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.186
God, huh? It is a Fire Soldier's duty to stop anyone

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:24.840
who is trying to bring calamity to this world, no matter who they are.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.866
It is because of that duty...

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:36.440
...that this forest... has been saved.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.870
Thank you... very much.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.646
We heard an incredible explosion.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.236
Ogun, is everyone all right?

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.156
Lieutenant Pan...

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.616
We're all done out here. Shinra just put the demon to rest, too.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.866
Hey!

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.020
Shinra is coming back.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.126
Lieutenant Pan,

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.416
how was the inside of the Tabernacle? Are you done investigating?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.450
We hit the mother lode!

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.210
I don't hear her voice.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.670
She must have gone to sleep.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.800
I am most grateful for your help in putting the demon to rest.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:55.536
What we learned during this investigation is a big leap forward for us.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.836
If Amaterasu in Tokyo is set up the same way as the Tabernacle here,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.086
it will also have a human power source.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.206
You're eating this up, huh?

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:08.256
Er... and if Amaterasu's power source is a person with an Adolla Burst,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.966
then the eight pillars would be... ...sacrifices.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.950
If they're sacrifices, then the word "pillar" fits right in.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.356
That girl who Linked with me, who we believe to be the First Pillar...

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:27.800
If there is a person inside Amaterasu, then she might very well be a sacrifice.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.906
And that intense feeling of hatred I felt from her?

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.916
She might resent humanity for making her live as a sacrifice.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.706
So unlike the "Woman in Black" inside the Tabernacle,

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.716
maybe she didn't choose to go inside, but was exploited instead.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.836
It sounds like the Holy Sol Temple and Haijima, who built Amaterasu,

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.676
might be hiding something, all right.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.780
"Haijima Industries"

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.846
Those eight arrows that were at the core...

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.226
They may be some kind of keys.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.776
The memory stick that Dr. Giovanni stole from Vulcan...

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.986
That might also have data on it regarding the "key" to Amaterasu,

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.276
similar to those arrows.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.430
But this series of numbers is something I have no idea about.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.746
Arthur-kun said they were pi.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.746
But until we get back to Tokyo and compare them, I can't tell for sure.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.876
If that is what they are, we don't even know if the two are related.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.256
Whatever the case,

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.216
we can be sure that things are going the way the Evangelist wants them to.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.016
Making sacrifices of the Eight Adolla Bursts,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.160
and using Amaterasu to kick start a Great Cataclysm.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.726
We're starting to see now what the Evangelist's goal is.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.146
But I have no intention of letting her wrap us around her finger anymore.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.816
"God," my eye!

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.760
I'll stop her, no matter what!

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.856
You're leaving already?

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.436
You've come all this way. Why not stay a little longer?

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.276
Heroes are busy people.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:36.026
Heroes, huh? You're amazing, Shinra.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:40.156
I'm just a weakling, who always has to have others help him.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:45.690
I can't do anything on my own. I'm just a coward who can't fight.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.876
What's too much for you is too much for you. What can you do?

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.586
But you are not a coward.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.386
Stubbornly taking too much upon yourself,

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.580
until it breaks you, just makes you miserable.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.080
You wanted to preserve this forest, right?

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.436
Where's the harm in turning to others to achieve that?

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.566
Acknowledging your weaknesses

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.606
and asking for help from others takes its own kind of courage.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.180
If things ever get dicey again, just call me.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.600
That's what heroes are for, after all.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.086
I'm going to train by digging a thousand holes every day!

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.676
And if that's still not enough, then I'll call for help, okay?!

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.306
Mm-hmm.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.870
See you later!

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.356
Hell yeah!

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.880
Seriously, why aren't you wearing your masks?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.736
"Mission"

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.510
"Complete"

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.400
The First Pillar?

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.940
Are you inside Amaterasu?

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.320
No...

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.320
...are you Amaterasu?

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.030
Shinra!

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.136
We're in Tokyo. Get ready.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.960
Y-Yes, sir.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.130
That girl appeared in my dreams again.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.196
Were your father and mother relieved?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.536
Mm-hmm. I told them about Scop and the others.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.076
They reclaimed the Oasis,

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.166
so the whole reason fer them to ransack our potato fields is all settled up now.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.916
Everything's hunky-dory.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:56.256
If they're so hard up, we coulda afforded 'em some potatoes, at least.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.336
I'm glad you got to see your parents.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.716
Mm-hmm, and the potatoes were doing well, too.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.966
I wanted more adventure.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.160
That gas was fun, huh?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.210
That girl I saw in my dream...

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.896
As the water she was in was evaporating...

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.920
...it looked like she was crying.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:22.720
Amaterasu... Who exactly is she, anyway?

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.956
If there really is someone inside Amaterasu,

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.576
it introduces a contradiction in the dogma and scripture of the Holy Sol Temple,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.110
which have been guiding the Tokyo Empire.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.416
Remember the words of the Prologue.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.700
"A long time ago, mankind was touched by the planet's anger..."

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.580
"Prologue: The Great Cataclysm"

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.936
A long time ago, mankind was touched by the planet's anger,

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.766
and the world was engulfed in flames.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.436
It was the Day of the Cataclysm.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.026
The flames burned ferociously,

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.356
with an intensity threatening to incinerate the places mankind lived in,

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.866
the languages they spoke, and the culture they had built up.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.640
"Chapter One: Holy Fire"

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.940
As the world was being covered in ash, one man appeared.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.086
He would later be called Raffles I.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:23.296
Raffles took his disciples and left on a journey in search of light.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.596
At the end of his journey, he found an "unsullied flame,"

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.000
and brought forth the light that would be mankind's salvation.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.000
"Chapter Two: Amaterasu"

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.986
Raffles and his disciples used the flame bestowed by the great Sol

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:46.656
and the technology cultivated by mankind to create "Amaterasu."

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.496
The sacred flame of Amaterasu benefitted the lives of mankind,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.480
and ended up establishing the foundation of a state in the Far East.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.190
"Noto Farms Potatoes"

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.500
See you later!

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.440
Today's Amaterasu operational rate is normal.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:50.306
Amaterasu is the reason why this country developed. But...

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.096
...if Adolla Bursts are actually something

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.330
that the Evangelist bestowed upon mankind...

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.226
If the Evangelist was the one who developed this country,

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.170
why is she trying to destroy it now?

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:10.640
You can't help but wonder if the Holy Sol Temple is hiding something, can you?

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.810
Let's head in and report to Captain Obi.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.476
Most incidences have their own name

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.356
But no one knows and I'm upside down

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.156
Billions of people exist

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.826
But not anybody tells me what that is

00:22:52.850 --> 00:23:00.496
Sacrificing my limited life Am I moving forward or not

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:07.626
I just want to believe Nothing goes to waste

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.006
I question myself Why I can't be who I want to be

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:17.636
tangled and translucent It drains me

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.976
Pretending and overextending myself

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.356
Wish one day I could love pathetic myself

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.406
Hoping for a dazzling future to come

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:35.036
Don't over decorate smile clumsily

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:42.456
Just live life the way I am This world is cruel

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.666
Can't choose how to be born

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:50.546
Stick up the middle finger then

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:55.410
Let's shoot off to the other side

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.476
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.620
"Next time"

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.566
The city of Tokyo swirls with deceit and intrigue.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:10.986
But there is a man here who risked his life to fight evil...

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.316
Licht-san, what is this all about?

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:18.196
Is this your just cause, Viktor Licht?

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:24.496
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 11, "Dark Hero." "Episode 11: Dark Hero"

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.506
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.530
