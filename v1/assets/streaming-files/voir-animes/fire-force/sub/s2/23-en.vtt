00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.610
Shinra, tell me everything Dr. Giovanni said to you in the Nether.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.610
Yes, sir.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.110
An Adolla Link...

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.530
...is a phenomenon that supposedly only happens among those

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.120
who have an Adolla Burst, or who have been in contact with Adolla.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.830
Shinra-kun has connected via an Adolla Link to Dr. Giovanni,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.130
as well as... ...Lieutenant Konro, of the 7th.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.380
Then this man Konro is questionable.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.050
No, there's no way!

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.760
Discussing Lieutenant Konro here will get us nowhere.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.730
I'm going to go over to the 7th and meet with the lieutenant.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.520
If I can find out the reason why I Linked with the lieutenant,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.440
we might be one step closer to the Evangelist.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.480
I'm off to see Lieutenant Konro!

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.410
Step right up! Buy one now, and I'll throw in another one for free!

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.500
Asakusa is nice and bustling.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.380
Are you sure we should be dropping in without an appointment?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.420
The people at the 7th can't stand to sweat the small stuff.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.760
Actually,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.930
why are you even coming along, Captain Hibana?

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.140
Konro could have ties to the Evangelist.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.310
You're too nice to others, and get fooled easily.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.400
I'm telling you, as far as Lieutenant Konro goes, he's on the level.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.110
Oh, the fella from the 8th. What brings you here today?

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.200
There's something I need to talk to Lieutenant Konro about.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.910
Well, he's not here.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.870
He went to a storage shed just outside of town on his own.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.460
Okay, I'll go check there for him. Thank you very much.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.460
By the way,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.250
you hound dog, bringing such a hottie along with you!

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.250
Is she your girlfriend?
Girlfriend?

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.550
No, she's not! This is the captain of the 5th!

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.880
Captain?

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.550
Girlfriend...

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.100
She really doesn't look like she'd object.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.900
The lieutenant is going off on his own to a storage shed with no one else around...

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.190
This is getting more and more suspicious.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.570
He must be running some errand.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.110
This is a proto-nationalist we're dealing with, too.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.530
There's no telling what he might be up to.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.530
Hold on.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.990
A White-Clad?!

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.620
There, you see?!

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.170
You've been following me for days now, huh?

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.710
Ho, you knew, and still came here alone?

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.840
You, a warrior who can't fight due to your tephrosis!

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.680
If we're doing this, then let's do it already.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.440
"Episode 23: Firecat"

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.030
Lieutenant Konro...!

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.450
He's getting attacked! We have to hurry and save him!

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.370
Don't be too hasty! This is our chance to catch him in the act!

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.580
Whoa!

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.500
Lieutenant Konro has tephrosis!

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.210
Lieutenant of the 7th, you are dead!

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.230
Lieutenant Konro!

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.480
Shinra?

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.110
So what you're saying is,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.610
you and I shared one of these "Adolla Link" things?

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.240
Yes.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.080
Do you have any idea why? Have you ever seen a hellish, alternate world?

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.750
I sure have.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.090
Two years ago, during the Great Fire of Asakusa.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.760
The one where that demon appeared in Asakusa?

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.600
Yeah. This is when I came down with my tephrosis.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.240
This Infernal was unlike any other.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.120
Almost like a mirror image of myself.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.130
Are you trying to replace me?!

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.720
Sorry, but you can't do that.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.190
Crimson Moon!

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.940
I'll see you in hell!

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.840
If that was some other world, then it would mean I had an Adolla Link.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.630
You say the demon felt like your mirror reflection? Like a doppelganger?

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.130
What's a doppelganger?

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.050
It's like a double of a person.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.520
There's sort of an urban legend that says

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.770
there's someone who looks exactly like you, somewhere in the world.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.190
It's nothing more than a ghost story, of course,

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.440
but apparently, if you run into your doppelganger, it's either kill or be killed.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.360
Yikes!

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.660
It did in fact seem like he came to kill me.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.700
And since you killed him instead, that makes you one hard-as-nails man.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.040
That's our Lieutenant Konro, all right.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.620
Don't be ridiculous.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.920
I think I'm going to check into doppelgangers a bit more.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.840
As a sophisticated lady, you're pretty smart.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.890
But why would they come after me?

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.390
Could it have something to do with the fact that you've seen Adolla?

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.180
Or your scar...

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.730
It seems like those who see Adolla tend to get some kind of disfigurement.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.940
So that goes for the others, too...

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.440
Still, why would they?

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.530
Could it be inconvenient for them

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.570
for there to be others who have seen Adolla?

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.660
What? Konro, you got attacked?

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.420
He was lurking around for so long,

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.040
I figured he wouldn't show himself until I was alone.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.510
It was amazing! He defeated him in one blow, without even using his abilities--

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.970
What did you do that out of the blue for, you idiot?!

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.220
You avoided that.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.390
You did teach me how to detect the breath of life, Captain Shinmon.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.810
Which means that you can now fight decently.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.520
Still, the White-Clad are starting to become more forceful, too.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.110
They have some people that my Rapid and Corna won't work against.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.490
Captain Shinmon, how would you fight against someone like that?

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.540
You might be able to pull it off now...

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.420
I would use the Hysterical Strength of the Fight or Flight Response.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.210
Hysterical Strength?

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.920
When you're on the verge of a crisis,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.340
and you overcome your limits to release all of your latent strength,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.470
it's called Hysterical Strength.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.430
H-How is it done?!

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.140
Hell if I know. You figure it out.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.270
Waka, you can't say that when you're the one who brought it up.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.230
Go round up the youngsters from your company.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.780
I don't want to have to teach this over and over.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.660
Lucky you! Waka is agreeing to give you his personal instruction again!

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.160
Thank you very much, sir!

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.160
I promise you, I'll get even stronger!

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.380
The Knight-samurai deigns to return to Asakusa once more.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.920
You sure you don't want to be the Samurai-knight?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.510
This way means you're a samurai.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.350
Let's cut the nonsense! Forward, men!

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.060
Pardon the intrusion.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.230
You're early. Is showing up ahead of time the imperial way?

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.480
It's you and top-knot head again, then?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.900
Actually, there's one more with us today.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.910
I'm Kotatsu Tamaki!

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.370
Please train me, as well!

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.060
You're here? You're too early.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.770
We're looking forward again to whatever you can teach us.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.240
Hm? What's this? There's one more of you.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.530
I'm well aware that I'm not at the level where I'm ready to receive your training.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.080
But I want to be someone other than the weak person I am now.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.000
Would you allow me to at least observe?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.040
You want to get stronger?

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.630
Yes, sir!

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.250
And why is that?

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:58.760
Because I'm so gutless right now that I'm a burden on the other crewmen.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.930
If I were stronger, there are lives that might have been spared.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.350
Is that a sob story?

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.890
No, sir! It's remorse and resolve!

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:16.820
I see. But merely observing is likely to bore you out of your mind.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.820
Hey!

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.530
--What is it, Waka? --What is it, Waka?

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.780
Go have some fun with that lady.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.660
--Who, that airhead? --Who, that airhead?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.370
What do you want to play, trampy lady?

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.670
And it better be fun, or you'll pay, shameless lady.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.130
Huh? Huh? Kusakabe?

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.010
Looking after those two is a handful.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.430
Tamaki, I'm going to see how strong you are

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.680
by the way you play with Hikage and Hinata.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.850
Oh, okay.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.560
Kon-san, aren't you going to watch the rookies from the 8th?

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.810
I'll do that once I finish sweeping up in here.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.780
Oh, I'll do that. You go ahead and watch.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.240
It's my duty today. I don't mind.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.540
Waka says you gotta keep away from both of us for one minute.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.210
We're gonna play tag.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.500
--Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! --Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.830
--All right, already. --Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! --Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.670
Okay, I'll start running.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.010
Though I don't want to run so fast it makes them cry.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.470
I'll just go nice and easy on them.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.220
Uh-oh, run!

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.140
--Are you mocking us?! --Are you mocking us?!

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.970
Th-That hurt!

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.980
--Run like you mean it, or we'll kill you! --Run like you mean it, or we'll kill you!

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.060
Damn it, all right, then.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.850
Girls shouldn't use potty language like "damn it"!

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.150
And if you talk down to us, we'll dump you right in the Sumida River!

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:44.030
You want me to run like I mean it, then? Well, don't cry if you can't keep up!

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:50.790
For heaven's sake, what is this? I didn't come to Asakusa to play games.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:55.170
I want to catch up with Shinra and Arthur, even just a little bit.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.670
Didn't we tell you not to hold back, you sow?

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.720
Do you honestly not want to get any stronger, you piece of crap?

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.100
We're being nice enough to play with you. Don't go getting the wrong idea.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.180
Are these girls that good?

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.690
Guess we better get started, too.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.320
Please do, sir!

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.780
Wow, haven't seen this in a while.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.780
What are you doing, sir?!

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.950
Not since it was Beni's turn.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.250
It's been a long time since we've taken in a sight like this.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.380
Another peaceful day in Asakusa.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.470
Ow! That's too hot! Ow! Ow!

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.010
--It's peaceful, all right. --My clothes are burning! My butt is sticking out!

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.480
--Eight seconds! Nowhere near a minute! --Eight seconds! Nowhere near a minute!

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.400
Yeah, I know!

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.400
But just watch this!

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.700
I mean business now! Go on and catch me if you can, you little brats!

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.990
Hina, looks like she's finally gotten motivated.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.160
We should get going, too, Hika.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.290
Coming through!

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.460
Woo-hoo!

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.960
Don't blame me if your kimonos get burned!

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.010
Wishful thinking! Five seconds!

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.430
Five seconds? That's less than last time.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.310
This is her meaning business? Don't make me laugh.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.560
I'm just getting started. Let's go again!

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.980
Isn't a minute too long for her?

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.270
Might as well make it 30 seconds.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.610
I'll show them.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.570
I'm a Fire Soldier.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:51.370
How is school going, Tamaki? Are you going to get your sister certification?

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.740
We're not a clerical family, so there are a lot of tests,

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.500
but the teacher says I'm doing fine.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.210
Don't get in over your head, now.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.710
It's just that because... ...Mama and Papa told me...

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.920
Tamaki-san, good morning!

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.420
Good morning.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.050
Ah, your badge!

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.720
Yeah! I'm a sister now!

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.640
I still have the written test and the interview before I'm certified as a sister.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.480
Yeah, but you're smart, so you'll do fine. Hang in there.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.770
--The Great Sol is watching your efforts.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.690
--And just because everyone else was doing it... --The Great Sol is watching your efforts.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.530
Nya!

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.110
Tamaki-san!

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.530
...but I kept tripping up for no reason.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:37.080
Are you all right? Easy, now... Is something wrong?

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.160
There's fire coming from your bottom!

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.330
Just because I started making flames...

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.260
Damn! How long was that?

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.170
Twelve seconds.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.670
One of your better times.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.220
Again!

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.760
That's amazing, isn't it? If you're a third generation,

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.260
does that mean you're going to be a Fire Soldier?

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.390
A Fire Soldier sister? Now that's cool!

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.980
If you do enlist, it will be at the 1st, right?

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.650
The 1st, huh?

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:06.730
Look there!

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.320
Wow!

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.200
It's Lieutenant Rekka Hoshimiya!

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.450
He's so cool, isn't he?

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.830
Young girl students! Don't just watch from over there, come here!

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.000
The 1st is fervently waiting for fresh faces like you to enlist!

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.170
Huh? What do we do?

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.080
He spotted us!

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.830
L-Let's get out of here!

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.130
I looked up to Lieutenant Rekka, the same way everyone else did.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:36.180
Just because... everyone else said so.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:42.600
Papa! Mama! I want to become a sister and join the 1st!

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.070
I became a Fire Soldier just because.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:52.150
I will stand by and see your end through!

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:57.030
You're going to die in my place, Tamaki!

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:02.870
Please, Kusakabe... Defeat Lieutenant Rekka.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.080
Leave him to me. That's why I'm here.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.040
I'll show them!

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.920
Too bad!

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.220
That was 18 seconds!

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.590
I want to change!

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:17.640
Hika... Hina...

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.310
But I've just been carried along by everyone else so far.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.890
I know it's not going to be that easy for me to change.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.060
And everyone else is trying so hard...

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.280
So then, so will I!

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.150
I'm going to try harder, too!

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.200
Thirty seconds left.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.700
We're gonna go all-out now, too.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.040
I swear I'm going to keep away from you.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.540
--Nya! --Ow!

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.960
S-Sorry!

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.840
No, I should apologize. My Lecher Lure strikes again.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:04.390
You know that boy you pounced on earlier, right? He's my boyfriend.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.850
"Lecher Lure" my eye! You did it on purpose, didn't you?

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.730
You flirty little warthog!

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.980
I'm sorry. But I really didn't do it on purpose.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.070
Go over and sit in the corner, you troublemaker!

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.750
Still wearing twin tails in middle school, too.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.670
For a warthog, you sure are a flirt! Hurry and get over there!

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.050
Are twin tails supposed to be flirty?

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.800
I like them--they're like floppy animal ears.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:46.600
Must be nice to be a cat. They don't get lechered.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.270
I wish I could be...

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.060
...as quick as...

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.400
...a cat!

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.130
Forty seconds! Not good, Hikage! If she keeps this up, she'll get away from us!

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:17.800
We're not gonna let her!

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.380
They're catching up!

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.510
And as nimble as a cat!

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.430
Damn, 45 seconds!

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.530
What are you sitting in the corner for? Come on over here.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.700
If I sit over there, my Lecher Lure will bother you, right?

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.420
I'll sit in the corner. You go sit over there.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.710
It's okay. I'm used to it.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.760
I'm more used to sitting in the corner. Give the "Devil" his due.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.060
"Slap"

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.520
--Put me down! --How does this happen?!

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.190
Look, I'll sit in the corner, okay?!

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.480
It's true, that is awkward as hell,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.900
but it doesn't mean you have to consign yourself to the corner.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.240
I mean, look at that idiot.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.030
He's as low as they come, but he always sits in the birthday boy's seat.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.990
Have a little self-respect, yourself.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.670
I'm done slinking off into the corner!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.550
Why did you come to a stop? Are you giving up?

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.300
For these last ten seconds, I'm not running away!

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.720
I'm steamrolling through!

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.690
Now she's coming after us.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.900
She might have actually gotten away, too!

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.230
--Unite! --Unite!

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.900
--Mother Fox! --Mother Fox!

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.860
I'm gonna tear right through you!

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:11.000
"Nekomata Fireball"

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.830
Nekomata Fireball!

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.590
--Damn that woman! We're not done yet! --Damn that woman! We're not done yet!

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.710
That's 60 seconds. I don't know why,

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.130
but there was some reason why you were suppressing your own power.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.220
Captain Shinmon!

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.310
But you've peeled that layer away, haven't you?

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.600
Thank you very much!

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.480
Nobody asked you to peel that much away.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.150
S-Sorry, sir!

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.230
--Floozy! --Floozy!

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:46.490
Is a simple game of tag enough to really change me that much?

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.700
Anyone who can't take a simple game this seriously

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.700
doesn't stand a chance when it comes to playing for keeps.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.290
Now, for the first time, you've stood in the ring.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:57.960
Keep it up.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.050
Thank you very much, sir!

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.970
What exactly are you doing to yourself over there?

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.350
Oh my...

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.690
Captain Shinmon! Where did you go?!

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.190
You can't tell us you've forgotten about us!

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.500
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.330
The strain of death is making me smile.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.790
"Next time"

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:09.510
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 24, "Signs of Upheaval."

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:13.530
"Episode 24: Signs of Upheaval"

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:13.530
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.
