00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.240
Hey... Mr. Almighty?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.306
You went down way too easily.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.556
Damn it, why do you think I brought you along?

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.316
He was pretty overconfident about being the mightiest Fire Soldier,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.670
but this is what it means to be an overly naive animal.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.446
What did you do?

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.260
Do you see anyone dumb enough to answer that?

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.006
Why, you... You dosed me with something, huh?

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.490
Impossible! That poison is immediately fatal to even large animals...

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.356
A blowgun. This is how he poisoned you.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.276
So how come you're all right?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.946
Hell if I know. What doesn't affect me doesn't affect me.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.326
...You really are Mr. Almighty, huh?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.826
...Circle around them! ...Don't let them through! ...You really are Mr. Almighty, huh?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.350
...Go call for more men! ...This is bad! ...Shut up. Let's get going.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.940
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.990
"Beni-J"

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.316
Everything I've had, I've lost,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.606
but I won't let go of this remaining spark

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.196
No, I won't let it go, not ever

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.786
Though there may be no right answers in my ill-defined tale,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.956
once I'm able to step forward...

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.626
They say something's wrong with me, but I'll do something with them

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.586
I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.216
But if my dreams have resolved themselves to be by your side

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.266
then there's nothing left for me to doubt anymore

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.106
Sparks fly as things kick off

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.936
until "black and white" turns to ashen gray

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.856
If there's a choice crown to be had

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.736
I want it, I want it I'll whizz my way toward you

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.656
until "double or nothing" gets zeroed out

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.456
If the clowns are melancholy

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.286
then nothing will get anywhere

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.626
I'll show you a love that burns hot enough to scorch ashes

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.280
I just spark again

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.306
"Episode 12: Shadows Cast by Divine Light"

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.976
Damn it, how did it come to this?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.766
Don't let them near the church!

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.476
Tch, buzz off, will you?

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.146
Do you know what's going to happen if you do this?!

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.026
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.180
The Destroyer God has gone mad!

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.246
Give me a break with that "god" business. I'm just a simple...

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.020
...wild child.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.046
♬ Down fall the tonsure-heads, ♬

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.876
♬ falling down like rain ♬

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.046
♬ Followers of Holy Sol, ♬

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.096
♬ falling down like rain ♬

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.660
♬ Arriving empty-handed for a raid is so much fun ♬

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.986
It's positively deserted in here.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.746
They're in the Nether.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.190
The Nether? I thought the Nether was anathema to the Holy Sol Temple.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.506
They forbid it because they don't want it to be seen.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.900
The truth is, they love the Nether.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.056
Hmm?

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.740
Down here.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.056
Hey, what's wrong? Let's go.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.880
How do you know all of this?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.930
Because yours truly also loves the dark.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.496
I think it's time for some answers.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.706
Who the hell are you?

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.256
I was content enough to come this far with you,

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.336
but depending on how you answer, I might have to put you down next.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.540
I'm not much for talking about the past. Does it really matter?

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.040
Hey, this isn't an empty threat.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.696
I used to be in this church, a long time ago.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.366
That's not so unusual, is it?

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.486
Hold on... More questions?

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.746
I'm surprised the demolishing king of Asakusa is so interested in others.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.060
Then, did you...

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.796
...used to cut your hair like that?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.636
No, I didn't! I worked more in the shadows, after all!

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.966
The shadows?

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.636
You'll see it for yourself soon enough.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.500
Now let's find the scriptures we're after before someone comes to stop us.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.646
So they have this down in the Nether?

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.010
It's a facility that uses old ruins that were already in the Nether.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.486
So what the hell are they planning down here?

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.720
Hey, now. You're a proto-nationalist; don't be afraid of the Nether.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.390
What's that?

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.900
They're here.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.330
The Holy Sol's Shadows.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.260
My old haunt.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.576
You were a member of this bunch?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.696
Yeah, well...

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:02.206
The Holy Sol's Shadows... the Holy Sol Temple's secret assassination team.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.126
Such a stale crowd.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.586
This holy ground is no place for profane masses like you to set foot in.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.636
How unwelcoming. I just wanted to say "I'm home."

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.136
What?

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.120
Does the name "52" mean anything to you?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.290
Hmm? You don't mean you're...?

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.130
Yes, I am.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.496
We are the children of the Sun.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.336
We devote our lives to and live in the shadows.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.126
Látom.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.820
...Látom. ...Látom.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.620
Damn it!

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.896
I-I give!

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.146
That will do. Stand down, 52.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.356
He's good.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.276
He's still just a kid, too.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.116
That was amazing, 52.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.890
It was no big deal.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.116
I'll take you on this time.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.166
You don't need to hold back. Come at me.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.086
Commander, 52 isn't up to pairing off with you yet...

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.190
Come at me.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.676
There is nothing special about you.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.250
We are all orphans of the Sun here, taken in by God.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.316
Whenever I see kids like you, who think they're something special,

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.406
I can't just let matters sit.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.486
Make no mistake, kid.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.076
...Scum does not press its luck. And you are scum.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.866
...That's enough, sir... ...Scum does not press its luck. And you are scum.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.036
You know that, right? The lowest form of irredeemable scum

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.706
ever to spring from anyone's loins.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.376
You can't do anything. Make no mistake.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.876
Please stop, sir! You'll kill him!

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.780
Don't be so naive as to think that everyone is special in their own way.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.806
People are not individuals; they are a group. A collective.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.750
Remember that.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:35.396
Everyone... is different... which means they're special...

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.736
...is such an obvious and crappy idea that I never thought it...

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.220
I just... want to get stronger...

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.876
Why... does the world suck as much as it does?

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.916
I want to get strong enough... to find out why.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.466
Even just a little stronger than everyone else,

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.530
so I can get rid of any bastard that gets in my way.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:12.500
What is wrong with this world? Why does it suck as much as it does?

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.156
This watch was left in the same place where I was abandoned.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.156
This watch is the only thing that connects me to the world.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.826
That watch again?

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.520
You said this watch was a keepsake from your parents, right?

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.296
Our only parent is Sol.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.860
You don't have any family.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.306
It appears you require further correction.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.910
Report to my room tonight.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:03.446
I'm not through with you yet. Stand up straight.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.406
For the nation and the Holy Sol Temple to be strong and beautiful,

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.020
pariahs such as ourselves are required.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.030
I will defile you right down to the bone.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:32.476
The demon Infernal took the baby, Sho Kusakabe, and fled.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.186
Find it and kill it.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.316
Yes, sir.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.550
Commander, it's 52!

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.736
The Holy Sol's Shadows are off-balance today because of the demon Infernal.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.890
If I let this chance pass, I'll never be free.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.690
My left eye...! Right now, Burns must be...

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.086
The Sun offers its light to all men equally, right?

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.030
Then please, let me have its light, too...

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.856
Dad!

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.026
There's a boy about my age lying on the ground outside the house!

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.210
Huh?

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.996
Let me help you out somehow to thank you.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.166
Your cleaning, your shopping, anything.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.286
There's no need for that. Don't you worry.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.206
You can wear these.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.126
Huh?

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.376
I'm handing them down to you.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.110
Thanks.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.490
All right, I got everything on here.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.736
For the first time, I realized the position I was in.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.930
No matter where I went, I would always be a stranger to the light.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.786
52 had already moved on.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.586
Did you eliminate the family?

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.416
Yes, sir.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.466
He has left the collective.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:29.306
From here on, he is alone. A single individual.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.450
He will never walk the path of humanity again.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:43.300
This world sucks.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:51.366
Over and over, and over, and over, you taught me that.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.826
That's why I want to know the truth of this world.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.586
You get lonely being by yourself, you little pup?

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:04.440
You two will never again see the light of the Sun.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.570
Kiss my ass.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.426
I'll take the commander.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.186
You can have the rest.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.806
Huh? We aren't each taking half?

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.250
Every one of them is awfully tough.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.390
In that case, this sounds like it's going to be quite a challenge.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.440
Go!

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.896
Your breathing...

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.366
...is that of those who are earnestly out for my life. However,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.930
I'm just here for a good fight.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.350
Here. Catch.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.900
Don't whine to me over a lousy arm.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.200
Is killing me the only thing you're thinking about?

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.710
Iai Chop, Form One: Fire Moon!

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:59.350
Apparently, you value your own lives as little as you do your opponents' lives.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.990
You haven't changed one bit.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.426
Whoa!

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.806
I guess it's no surprise you look the same with that mask on.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.096
You could have just stayed cowering in hiding forever.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.290
I wanted to play a game with someone.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.550
Join me for a hand.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.796
Hmm, I've avoided your zigzag sword itself,

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.546
but the disruptions in air currents caused by the erratically-moving blades

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.620
make the motion of the flames released by them impossible to read.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.346
"Zigzag La Bamba Bomber"

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.880
Zigzag La Bamba Bomber!

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.590
I'm not going to make this easy on you.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.986
You loser.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:24.350
I'm going to keep torturing you until you use up all your cards.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.770
Or would you rather back out of the game, instead?

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:49.356
Game hell, you idiot. You know I didn't come here to play.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.750
You're the one who said it.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.510
This is a deathmatch.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.276
The lone wolf driven from the pack

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.706
has been sharpening his fangs to claim the head of the hated alpha.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.940
I am always alone.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:22.740
52... With a deck of 52 cards, I will take your life.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.580
Keep counting until your life is at an end!

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.130
How many hands are left now?!

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.656
Those of us in the collective have the strength of unity.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.326
Even though we may split up, we will always return to become one again.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.916
The individual simply falls where he stands.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.440
You are the one who should be counting, 52.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:01.240
How many cards left before your life is at an end?

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.686
You've lost more of your cards, 52.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.146
It looks as though you only have a few cards remaining.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:17.316
You may have thought you left the group to obtain freedom,

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:22.276
but you are just a weakling, who could not live among our collective.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.656
Once a loser, always a loser.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.350
And a loser that leaves the collective can never achieve victory.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:39.716
I am the one who trained you. I know everything up your sleeve.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.386
How many cards left now?

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.046
Two of them.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.266
When you've used your last card, I will finish you off.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.000
How does it feel to know that certain death is approaching?

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.650
You've lost your final card. Time to kill you.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:30.306
♬ I'm a midnight thinker ♬

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:34.096
♬ I'm a smoker ♬

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.840
♬ I'm a joker ♬

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.826
What's the matter? Why?

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.166
Why did you think I was all alone?

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.360
Answer that, you piece of crap!

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:05.426
This smoke from these leaves has a psychedelic effect.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:10.766
I made friends with someone who was good at making some pretty nasty stuff.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:15.790
It doesn't affect my plus-one here, so I felt free to use it.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.170
How long has...

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.526
What's the matter? Go ahead and make yourself whole again.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.786
You always become one again after splitting up, don't you?

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.390
52, you rotten...!

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:40.270
I don't have just 52 cards anymore.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:01.670
I can't afford to use my trump card on a loser who only hangs with his pack.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:12.100
Isn't that right? Not if I'm going to defeat you.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.030
"To be continued"

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.516
Most incidences have their own name

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:45.396
But no one knows and I'm upside down

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.196
Billions of people exist

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.866
But not anybody tells me what that is

00:22:52.890 --> 00:23:00.536
Sacrificing my limited life Am I moving forward or not

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:07.676
I just want to believe Nothing goes to waste

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.046
I question myself Why I can't be who I want to be

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:17.686
tangled and translucent It drains me

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:23.016
Pretending and overextending myself

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.396
Wish one day I could love pathetic myself

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.446
Hoping for a dazzling future to come

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:35.076
Don't over decorate smile clumsily

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:42.496
Just live life the way I am This world is cruel

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.706
Can't choose how to be born

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.586
Stick up the middle finger then

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:55.450
Let's shoot off to the other side

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.516
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.580
"Next time"

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.266
Captain Burns of the 1st arrives out of nowhere.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.396
But Joker seems to have already known he was there.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.946
What truth about their relationship will now be revealed?

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.406
I'm curious, as well.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:17.786
The clues to what you want to know are right here.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.866
"Episode 13: A Pair of One-Eyes"

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:24.036
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 13, "A Pair of One-Eyes."

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.396
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.420
