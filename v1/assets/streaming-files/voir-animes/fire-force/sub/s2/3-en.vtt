WEBVTT

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.190
Get out of me!

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.046
Guess I'm out of luck. That's all the killer instinct you have, huh?

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.650
Still, I enjoyed that more than I expected.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.296
No, wait! You said you would let me see my mother, right?

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.740
Does that mean my mom still actually exists?

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.566
Heh-heh, that's a good question. You rejected me, so I'm not telling.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.640
Wait!

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.986
Oh, one other thing.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.406
Haumea, Sho, Shinra... and now it looks like one more Pillar is about to be born.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.286
I'm going to go play with them now.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.270
Pillar? You mean, a person who has an Adolla Burst?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.126
The Evangelist has likely also realized that a new Pillar is being born.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.780
The Fire Force or the Evangelist... Which one will obtain the Pillar?

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.490
Who the hell are you...?

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.120
I've been watching this empire for a very long time.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.306
Pupil response is normal.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.670
Fully conscious, too.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.976
There doesn't seem to be any problem.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.550
What happened to us? I don't remember a thing.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.260
It looks like they were being controlled by someone, all right.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.246
The same as the one who was controlling Shinra?

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.616
No, someone different from Shinra.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.350
These guys were the work of that electricity girl.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.440
It looks like the First Pillar took off,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.400
so I released the guys from the 4th.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.426
I have to say, though, the First Pillar did say something interesting.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.056
Something interesting?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.306
That the fifth person with an Adolla Burst was about to be born.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.516
Huh?! What do you mean, Haumea?! Huh, Haumea?!

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.000
What's going on? What did you just say... Shut up!

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.930
We're scrambling against those Fire Force punks!

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.480
"Episode 3: A New Flashpoint"

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.416
Someone else with an Adolla Burst is about to be born?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.670
And the Evangelist is aware of this, too?

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.130
Yes, sir.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.676
It's not clear if it's true or not, but from what they said,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.676
the Evangelist is gathering those who possess Adolla Bursts,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.910
and is planning to trigger another Great Cataclysm like the one 250 years ago.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.936
We can't exactly take anything the enemy says at face value,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.750
but it's also true that we can't just ignore this.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.396
I'm sorry to have given you so much trouble today, sir.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.696
I will submit a written apology in the next few days.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.350
Don't worry about it. I can overlook something like this.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.940
It's because of you that I got another glimpse of Adolla.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.560
Can I ask you one last thing?

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.780
Why do you think you saw Adolla, sir?

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.280
I came close to the truth in that great fire. That's probably why.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.500
Thank you for everything you did today.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.106
I'll be going now, then.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.880
Sorry for all the trouble.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.146
Not at all. It's been a while since I've seen my grandfather.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.930
The 6th will continue to work together with all of you.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.310
That crazy girl who connected with me over an Adolla Link...

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.370
...and this new bearer of an Adolla Burst she mentioned...

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.360
If it turns out to be true, then we have to protect them from the Evangelist.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.330
You really put me out. What would have happened if I hadn't been around?

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.670
Yeah. This time, at least, it was my bad.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.026
There's no way Shinra is as agreeable as that!

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.030
Huh? I am so agreeable! To everyone who isn't as awful as you, anyway!

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:29.960
Hmph.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.520
Thinking about what the truth is won't help us find it.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.706
Even so, I'm going to save Sho and my mom.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.590
I'm going to protect the fifth Adolla Burst bearer, too.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.340
I'm a hero, after all!

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.796
"Fire Defense Agency"

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.400
Now that we know what the Evangelist's people are after,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.350
we should bring all the companies together and strike at them!

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.316
Now, take it easy, Obi. I've already spoken to each company.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.840
"Fire Defense Agency Chief"

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.680
We also had a report of a new Adolla Burst bearer being born.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.696
They're not too quick to believe that.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.520
Haijima in particular is being uncooperative.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.246
The fact remains, the Evangelist is responsible

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.360
for bringing about man-made human combustion.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.506
The Adolla Burst itself is still plenty mysterious.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.836
It's not even clear if bringing those who possess them together

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.830
can cause another Great Cataclysm.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.136
We can't get every company behind this when there isn't any proof.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.766
It will be too late once it happens.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.310
Absolutely right. That's why I gave you the 8th.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.066
You're free to act as you like at the 8th, the same as you have been.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.090
I've got you covered.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.660
So we cannot bring the entire Special Fire Force together for this.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.420
Very well. The 8th will continue to investigate alone, as always.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.520
Please excuse me.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.360
You've become a lot more reasonable.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.730
You sure you haven't grown up a little?

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.710
I'm only more quick to suppress my dissatisfaction and give up than I was before.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.136
I don't consider myself more mature.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.290
Then what do you consider growing up?

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.096
The depth and breadth of one's love.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.190
I will never give up on keeping the world safe.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.250
If you'll excuse me...

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.690
That's just like you, Obi.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.350
You're right, we can't have any more casualties.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.040
We have to snuff out this fire at the source as soon as possible.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.076
You know that senior that just moved in?

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.126
Yeah, sure.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.310
He is so cool, isn't he?

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.656
Your taste in guys is as weird as ever.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.126
Huh? That's not true.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.756
Oh yes it is.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.910
I'm telling you, he's cool.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.120
Tell me, don't you think so?

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.700
Inca, what's up?

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.846
Sorry, I forgot something.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.550
...Again? ...Go on without me!

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.410
Such a fragrant aroma...

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.270
No doubt about it.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.536
Is it coming, Boss Inca?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.246
That's welcome news.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.480
You're late, Panda and Sancho!

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.876
Sorry about that, Boss.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.610
It's because you're such a dawdler, Panda.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.610
The smell is getting stronger.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.780
We're on! Get ready!

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.030
I sure hope it's a rich guy's house that catches fire this time!

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.200
This is the house. Should be easy to get inside.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.930
Okay, the fire is about to start.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.760
Let's get this underway.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:58.890
Yeah.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.770
Time to make some money.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.990
Hmm? What's that smell?

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.226
F-Fire! There's a fire downstairs!

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.516
Having a bit of trouble? It looks like it's already pretty well burning.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.210
Th-Thank goodness you're here! Help me!

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.800
I'll get you out of here, if that's what you want.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.736
However, you have to give me your valuables first.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.516
What are you talking about?! Th-There's a fire!

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.166
Yeah, so there's no time to agonize over this.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.440
If you want me to help you, hand over everything you have.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.796
Th-There's a pen tray at the bottom of the drawer in that room.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.256
The money is under that!

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.370
I'm disabled. Take whatever you want, just hurry up and save me!

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.330
Nice!

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.436
Whew, you're heavy, you old geezer.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:15.010
I-I'm saved... Good. We're out of here, you two.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.720
We divide it 20-20-60.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.356
That's no fair.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.810
Sure it is. It's all because of me.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:27.640
Well, fair point. You're the only one who knows where the fires break out.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.706
That's what's strange, though. How can you tell?

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.206
I've never heard of a generation that can predict outbreaks before.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.426
First generations become Infernals through human combustion.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.546
Second generations can manipulate and control flames.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:48.346
Third generations can ignite their own flames, and alter their force and shape.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.250
But I can't control or produce flames.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.986
I just might be something of an unprecedented fourth generation!

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.850
...A fourth generation? ...A fourth generation?

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.300
It was that great fire two years ago.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.740
Many lives and many items were lost in that fire.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.390
At the time, I didn't even know why I had been born.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.996
I'd just as soon have spontaneously combusted,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.650
wishing that I could go out in a blaze of glory.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.780
As the flames kept coming into being, more lives were lost.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.056
As I found myself in the middle of that desperate situation,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.120
I had a thought for the first time ever...

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.360
"Live!"

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.280
Life. As I was surrounded by the heat and terror of the flames...

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.550
...I experienced a sense of elation I'd never felt before.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.390
I don't want to die. Gotta get out of here.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.770
Oh, over there...

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.860
Huh? Again?

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.450
How come?

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.306
I can tell... where the flames are going to spread.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.120
The scent becomes a line... and I can see it!

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.316
I get it. Where the lines of light are stronger and thicker

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.770
is where the burning will come.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.300
This is a piece of cake, then! I can get out of here!

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.310
At the time, I had lost an awful lot, but in return, I had gained this power.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.706
But what you're doing is fireground thievery, so...

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.536
Or is it fireground mugging?

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.106
Nothing is more precious than life! I save their lives;

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.626
getting some valuables from them seems like a small price to pay.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.316
But you don't feel like you're alive

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.966
unless you're exposing yourself to danger, like fire scenes.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.306
You risk your life, saying you feel a terrific rush in that momentary thrill...

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.146
What you might call an adrenaline junkie, right?

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.340
Hmm...

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.380
I do enjoy danger, to be sure. The more thrilling something is, the more I like it.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.340
...be born...

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.980
...danger... like... be born...

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.960
The danger you like so much is about to be born.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.440
Something wrong? You suddenly...

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.410
What was that? That woman just now seemed incredibly dangerous.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.770
Danger is about to be born?

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.290
Nice!

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.260
It's almost time.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.970
...Fifth... llar is about... be born...

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.690
Scramble.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.010
Not you again!

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.036
Okay, we're heading back.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.446
Find us some more work sometime.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.656
Hold on.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.850
What is it?

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.206
It's bad!

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.400
It's bad, it's bad, it's so bad!

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.160
How come...

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.756
How come so many fires are breaking out?

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.826
Another fire?

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.716
What? What do you see?

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.056
People are gonna die. Time to make some money!

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.540
This whole area is about to become a sea of flame!

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.760
The Fireground Thief schoolgirl?

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.066
She's famous in the empire.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.350
Apparently, she always gets to a scene before the Fire Soldiers do.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.366
She's been suspected of setting the fires herself,

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.930
but the victims have all testified that that's not the case.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.770
But how does she know where the fires are going to be?

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.320
Ah, over there.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.860
The next one will be there.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.730
I just got a report of someone who was rescued by a mysterious girl.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.570
This girl is at the scene of the fire we're now heading to.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.090
Hey, does anyone have a conductor's baton?

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.550
Given her unusual ability, there's a good chance that she's the Fifth Pillar.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.026
She helps people and takes their valuables from them?

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.510
I'm not sure if what she's doing is good or bad.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:19.480
The Fire Force or the Evangelist... Which one will obtain the Pillar?

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.086
If that girl really is the fifth,

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:27.610
I have to make sure that the Evangelist's men don't take her away, like Sho.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.430
I have to secure her, no matter what.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.160
We'll arrive at the scene in a moment.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.830
Everybody, check your equipment. Maki-san, let's use your Owl Eye.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Acknowledged.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.340
Owl Eye online.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.906
I installed an ultra-telephoto camera into her Tekkyo.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.640
Can you see the site?

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.720
Oh, that's perfect!

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.326
Multiple outbreaks of fires on this scale...

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.560
Those Insects may be the cause of this.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.586
Additionally, we'll need to deal with the Evangelist's people.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.900
We don't have enough people on our own.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.580
Putting the Infernals to rest and saving lives is our top priority.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.516
Maki, watch the area from above and give us detailed reports.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.210
Yes, sir.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.266
I'm counting at least eight Infernals at the scene.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.356
One of them is approaching from three o'clock!

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.380
Mm-hmm.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.840
I have a separate mission for you two.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.026
Shinra, you search for the schoolgirl and the White-Clad.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.050
Roger!

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.000
Arthur, if the plasma-user shows up, deal with her.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.300
Is everyone ready?

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.650
Company 8, let's go!

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.400
...Yeah! ...Yeah!

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.376
So much fire, all at once...

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.756
We're gonna earn like crazy!

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.256
We should hurry and evacuate.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.926
What are you talking about? This is our chance to make a fortune!

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.620
What are you talking about? It's too dangerous.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:03.186
You may have the ability to read where the flames are going,

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.590
but we're just ordinary people.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.306
Oh, right.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.726
Well, I'll just go by myself then.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.236
Don't do it! There are Fire Soldiers there, too!

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.736
I'm gonna have it all to myself.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.090
Hold on!

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:18.670
How can I not dive into a thrill like this?

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.076
Antenna perked up. Thoughts a-popping.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.036
Here come the whole town's thoughts flowing in!

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:26.746
"Mwa-ha-ha"

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:27.876
"Find you."

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.666
"This is a little too much water."

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.626
"Spread some more water and bam!"

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.540
Found you!

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.756
Here goes! Guerilla Radio! Radio Head!

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.990
Incoming signals, Charon! Thoughts!

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:47.306
The girl is at the park on top of the hill. Copy that! Moving to secure!

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.556
...Yeah! ...Yeah!

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.896
This is seriously dangerous!

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.236
Let me go! I lived through that huge fire before.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.380
That doesn't mean you'll survive this one, though.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.140
You're the Fifth Pillar, right?

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.076
...Wha...? ...Huh? You're Inca, right?

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.286
No? Wrong? You're the Fifth Pillar, right?

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.480
Tell me, you are, aren't you? Answer me!

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:16.336
I know she's supposed to be here somewhere. This is it, right?

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.320
Hey, what do you want?!

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.830
B-B-Bro!

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:32.130
My breath... My breathing... My chest...

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.800
What's the matter, Inca?

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.630
Oh, this? You'll get used to this right away.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.840
Get used to it?

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.696
Where is the Fifth Pillar?

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.850
Come along. The Evangelist is waiting.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:53.046
Get used to what? The sea of flames? The smell of freshly-spilled blood?

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.260
The quest for even greater danger?

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.990
Come with us. We need you.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.450
You... need me...?

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.250
Who are you people? Why do you need me?

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.896
To achieve the goal of the Evangelist. We're gathering the Pillars

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.130
to once again trigger the Great Cataclysm from 250 years ago.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.430
What is that? It's not like the others.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.010
"Start"?

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.690
Again... What?

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.780
She's found her fire-ignition ability!

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.110
Panda, get out of here! I'm the one he's after!

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.290
You're not getting away!

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.920
Evangelist? Great Cataclysm? Fifth Pillar? What does he mean?

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.380
This is a weaker line than the others up to now, but...

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.840
Huh?

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.390
You can predict even faint heat? That's awesome.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.270
You have nowhere to run. Give up.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.360
Charon-sama... Seize her.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.030
What is it? Do you still see something?

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.636
Huh? Do you see something else?

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.570
What? Now what is it?

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.500
Huh? Do you really see anything?

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.660
The hero has arrived!

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:34.606
Are you all right?

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:35.976
The Special Fire Force?!

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.186
Do you happen to be the Fifth Pillar? I'm taking you into custody.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:44.180
Fifth Pillar?! Why is the Special Fire Force after me, too?!

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.810
Custody, you say? You can forget that.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.980
Just take it easy and let me handle this, please.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:58.296
You're Shinra Kusakabe, huh? The Fourth Pillar and the Fifth Pillar...

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.900
If I catch you both, it'll be two Pillars with one stone.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.676
...One! ...Charge him!

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.836
...Two! ...Charge him!

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.006
...Three! ...Charge him!

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.240
Four!

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.306
...One! ...Overpower him!

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.516
...Two! ...Overpower him!

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.766
...Three! ...Overpower him!

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.210
Four!

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.140
You're fast, all right. But...

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.230
I'd heard you went up against Sho,

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.926
but unless you're receiving the Evangelist's Grace,

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.756
you're just a nimble little fire-rat.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.910
Walk!

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.106
Charon's gone and gotten started.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.880
Okay, Mister Hero, go ahead and protect Inca-chan.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.350
Because if you don't, we're gonna take her from you.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:17.770
Come on, fire-rat, run away with those fast feet you're so proud of.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.610
Screw that. There's no way I'm running from you, you bombshell gorilla.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.900
"To be continued"

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.386
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.580
"Next time"

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.896
The fire spreads throughout the town. Multitudes of Infernals appear.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.356
As the full force of the 8th opposes the White-Clad's plans,

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.736
another demon Infernal turns up? Oh, no! We need more people!

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.866
Fire Soldiers like their bothersome rope play, don't they?

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:17.996
"Episode 4: Groping Through the Fire"

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.270
