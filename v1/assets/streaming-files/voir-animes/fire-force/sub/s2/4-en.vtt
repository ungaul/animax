00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:08.586
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.450
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.450
...is death by fire.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.186
Please evacuate quickly!

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.840
We will put the Infernals to rest!

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.140
Aw, not our town...

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.166
Someone, please hurry and put my husband out of his misery!

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.376
An Infernal!

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.796
Sister!

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.716
Right!

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.676
The flame is the soul's breath. The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.976
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.710
May thy soul return to the great flame of fire.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.960
Látom.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.156
That was the third one.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.606
There are so many of them,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.890
and they're spreading out throughout the town.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.286
I've spotted several of them near the lieutenant.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.940
It appears that the number of Infernals is still increasing.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.386
With this many of them, there's no question they're using those Insects.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.426
There has to be a command center somewhere directing them all.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.370
It could be that plasma user from the Nether.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.686
Haumea-sama, we have finished exploring the eastern quarter.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.710
Even after all that, there is still no one compatible. On to the next area.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.116
Get some distance.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.970
The Fire Force is nearby.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.980
"Episode 4: Groping Through the Fire"

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.110
Blue Stripes! We've got an Infernal!

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.596
There are so many of them.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.606
Keep spraying them to slow them down until we can put them to rest.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.840
Got it.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.356
Maki-san, we're more or less keeping them at bay,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.776
but we need the sister to put them to rest.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.196
Copy.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.446
The sister is heading this way now!

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.140
Just hold on!

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.600
Vulcan!

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.820
Infernals from the rear, too?

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.290
I am terribly sorry. Please forgive me for putting you to rest without a prayer.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.170
No, it's all right, Lieutenant!

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.776
The flame is the soul's breath. The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.866
Ashes thou wert and art. May thy soul return to the great flame of fire.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.390
Látom.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.126
Látom.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.046
Are you all right, Vulcan-san?

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.926
That was close. You saved me.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.426
I'm sorry we took so long. We just finished putting another one to rest.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.676
I need you to keep stopping them on the front lines.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.436
If we don't ensure the Fire Fighters' safety, they can't put out the fires.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.976
Understood, sir.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.806
Vulcan, good to go?

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.686
No problem, sir. Two more Infernals down this way.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.566
Ugh, if I'd known it would be like this, I wouldn't have come.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.156
The distribution of these Infernals is not at all spontaneous.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.656
They're probably using Insects to set people ablaze and split us up.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.956
Maki, Vulcan, locate the plasma user for me.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.690
She must be issuing instructions to the hostiles throughout town.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.306
Vulcan, plasma user acquired.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.436
I'll send Arthur her way, so send me her location.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.750
Copy.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.276
Arthur, do you read me?

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.866
I've located the plasma user.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.350
I'm coming to get you on the double, so fight her off.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.586
I'm taking you with me, too. Don't interfere, just come quietly.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.126
Screw that!

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.296
Who do you two think you are?

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.306
I'll decide for myself what I'm gonna do.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.516
I may not understand what your objective is,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.580
but don't go deciding for me if you're escorting me or securing me!

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.210
WALK!

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.270
You possess an Adolla Burst. Your freedom... is gone.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.046
I'll take you somewhere safe right away.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.256
Just leave this to me. I'm a hero, after all.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:20.000
Safe? What for? That's so dull. Out of the question.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:29.026
Day-to-day life without any thrills? That would be so boring.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.106
Count me out.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.776
What are you talking about?

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.736
You may steal money from people, but you still save their lives, right?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.156
I don't care if you do save me, I'm not giving you anything.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.666
I was never after anything in return in the first place!

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.126
It's because you people are like this

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.046
that people think getting rescued is something to be expected.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.336
You're turning out incompetent scum that can do nothing but wait for you!

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.336
As long as the people end up getting rescued, what does it matter?

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.796
Having an ability doesn't make you a bigshot!

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.216
People don't know what's right or what's wrong.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.056
Don't go forcing your boring safety on me!

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.420
Huh?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:19.236
Whoa, this one is tough. Still...

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.616
I'm just gonna burn the same way I've seen others, right?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.126
What's suddenly come over you?

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.070
So what if I just do whatever I want to?

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.510
Wait!

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.616
The Fifth Pillar belongs to us!

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.680
Get out of my way!

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.036
I'm picking up multiple heat sources.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.626
Stay right with me.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.666
Two of them at one o'clock.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.860
One of them at nine o'clock.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.136
No, there's more than just them.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.636
So it would seem.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.620
How are we supposed to stop this many of them without putting them to rest?

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.250
Hold on!

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.826
There's a far stronger heat source coming from that group of them!

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.400
What?

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.610
Is that...?

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.410
A demon Infernal.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.650
It can't be...

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.926
This is great!

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.136
Of course a demon is gonna be born!

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.766
We have someone here who just had her Adolla Burst awaken.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.686
I knew that if we used Insects around her to cause human combustion,

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.266
we'd have a demon pop up from among them.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.776
Though I have to admit, it's gonna be quite the ordeal for them.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.696
Imagine, not being able to finish off an Infernal without putting them to rest!

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.826
You Fire Soldiers sure tie yourselves up in some inconvenient bondage games.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.036
Maki-san, we've got a demon on our hands now.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.956
There's no way we can stop them.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.876
The sister is heading there now.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.876
Just hang on!

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.980
Easy for her to say.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.426
What are we supposed to do by ourselves?

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.386
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:28.016
I didn't mean to take so long. I had some trouble getting changed.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.766
Tamaki, you've been through the sisters' training?

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.106
Well, I did come from the 1st, after all.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.566
But this is my first time putting anyone to rest in the field.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.436
Do your best.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.010
Yes, sir, I'll start right away...

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.526
Why me?

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.696
How did everything from the neck down come off?

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.696
And how come only the veil stayed on?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.786
The bikini-and-veil look is an awfully niche kink.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.336
Wait, if you can get to heaven that way, that may not sound so bad.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.900
Don't be ridiculous. There's no way.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.126
...Here they come! ...If we can't put them to rest, what are we supposed to do?!

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.136
...If we can't put them to rest, what are we supposed to do?!

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.780
Oh, sorry! I'll get dressed again right away!

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.130
Hang in there, Vulcan.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.186
This is where we're gonna meet our end, all right.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.186
Don't give up!

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.396
Just hold on, you two! I'm almost finished...

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.316
Damn it! Whoa...!

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.800
...Vulcan! ...Damn it, damn it...!

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.626
For heaven's sake, Tamaki...

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.756
As always, what are you even doing?

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.030
Lieutenant Karim!

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.396
This is Hinawa. Lieutenant Karim from the 1st has joined us.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.856
He's here? That's a big help.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.566
I thought we couldn't count on any of the other companies to work with us.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:12.866
Not officially, no. But I requested a little personal assistance.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.496
I hear you're short on clerical help.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.860
I'm really glad you're here. Now we can put them to rest.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.320
All right, let's go!

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.226
Go grab the girl who ran away.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.726
Sir!

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.436
Hold it!

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.840
Move it!

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.606
Let go of me, you...!

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.880
No you don't!

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.850
Is that...?

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.850
Backdraft Bubblish Gum.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.756
It's you! The guy from the 5th!

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.506
Toru Kishiri!

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:11.136
I got a request that you wanted some extra help, so here I am.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.556
There's another one?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:18.420
N-No, not me. I just happened to be passing by. No, really...

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.946
Whoa, hell of a barrage.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.600
This is bad! This is bad, but here I am!

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.496
Juggernaut!

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.640
Let's get 'em!

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.860
We can't just run up to them.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.950
Stay away!

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:04.266
Way to go, Juggernaut! I'll make sure not to let them anywhere near us,

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.986
so you just keep on backing away and firing at them!

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.896
You just make sure!

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.986
Keep your distance and return fire!

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.180
Sir!

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.060
Keep away!

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.006
I hate to do this, you two, but you've got this!

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.176
Huh?!

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.296
I'm not going to let them get that girl!

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.966
Hm? Shinra Kusakabe! Where do you think you're going?

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.936
You're going where Inca is, right? Isn't that right?!

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.250
Answer my question!

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.300
Damn it!

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.416
Let me go! Let go of me!

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.586
Be quiet!

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.296
Stop that! Let the girl go!

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.176
Butt out! I want to live someplace that scares the living daylights out of me!

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.370
What is wrong with you?

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.696
Hurry! The Infernals are coming!

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.576
That way is cut off!

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.866
Sister, we need to put the next one to rest, please.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.180
Yes, sir.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.650
We call it a prayer, but she puts her whole soul into supplicating.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:52.296
The sister's strength and concentration has their limits.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.006
Are you all right, Sister?

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:58.136
Hmm? There's nothing at all wrong with me, sir.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.870
The flame is the soul's breath. The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.476
Who are you?

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.670
A sister squad under the command of Lieutenant Karim.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.010
Company 2 Platoon on the scene!

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.156
Company 5 Platoon, secure an evacuation route for the civilians!

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.520
...Yes, sir! ...Yes, sir!

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.376
Am I glad to see them! Reinforcements!

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.336
Captain Obi, I am Platoon Leader Taguchi, from the 2nd.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.990
I am Platoon Leader Tokuyama, from the 5th.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.766
Thanks for the assistance. I'm glad you answered my call.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:48.016
I've known about you since your days as a regular Fire Fighter, sir.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.630
It is an honor to be able to work together with you today.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.606
Company 2 Platoon, put those Infernals to rest!

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.026
Company 5 Platoon, after securing that route, get everyone evacuated!

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.390
...Yes, sir! ...Yes, sir!

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.416
Captain, look how many of them there are. Isn't this great?

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.336
Yeah.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.320
We aren't the only Fire Soldiers that want to protect people.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.266
The flames are now spread out all across town.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:29.476
Adding a few more Fire Soldiers at this point won't do any good.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.646
The Fifth Pillar is as good as ours.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.800
Celestial Knight Slash!

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.236
Whoa, you freaked me out.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.316
Gah, it's you again!

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.366
Maki, shock lady acquired.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.810
Take her out.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.116
So you're the enemy commander, are you?

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.536
I challenge you to a one-on-one duel!

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.836
Charon, I've got a problem here. Hurry it up.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:00.386
I'm not siding with either one of you guys! Let me go! Release me!

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.410
Let the girl go!

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.806
...Hold her there...Let me go!

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.266
Sir.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.540
I'm getting real tired of that hulking frame of yours.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.880
I'll blow you away!

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.840
That was nothing!

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.340
CLAP!

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.770
Your attacks are all speed and no heat.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.966
Oh, shut up. Screw you.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.660
Still, the fact remains that my Rapid doesn't work against him.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.540
He triggers explosions just by walking.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.010
I could create explosions like that, too, if I wanted to.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:08.656
The flame is the soul's breath. The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.270
Fire!

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.286
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:20.320
May thy soul return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.136
Captain, the Infernals are being put to rest like clockwork now.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.266
But how are we going to extinguish all this fire?

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.710
The way things are headed, the whole town is going to burn down.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.286
Return to the great flame of fire.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.866
Látom.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.866
Whew. That just leaves...

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.650
...the one-horned demon Infernal!

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.516
Damn! I can't send out orders when you're around!

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.936
I am going to shatter your scheme!

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:22.260
Hmph, oh, are you, now? But then, we already have the Fifth Pillar!

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.406
We're going to be the ones to assemble the eight key Pillars.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.616
Unhand me! I do not belong to anyone!

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.076
Let me go! Release me!

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.440
That leaves you, Fourth Pillar.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.256
I can't beat him like this. However...

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.466
...when I was training with Captain Shinmon,

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.370
there was one tenokata form that caused an explosion.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.476
You extend your index and pinky fingers.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.766
Whenever you get in a pinch, remember "rock" while making this sign,

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.380
and it will inspire courage within you.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.066
I guess I'll try it.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.050
I'm just getting started, you damn gorilla!

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.640
The form I learned from Captain Obi himself...

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.070
The "Corna"!

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.976
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.580
"Next time"

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.646
Shinra-san squares off against the White-Clad Charon.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:10.196
While fighting an uphill battle against a foe he can't lay a scratch on,

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.986
he finally figures out the secret. Now, Shinra-san! Your finishing move!

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.996
We'll see about that!

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.156
"Episode 5" "Corna (Sign of the Devil)"

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:23.916
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 5, "Corna."

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.426
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.450
