WEBVTT

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.400
What is with this guy? There's no stopping him.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.010
Juggernaut!

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.180
Juggernaut...

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.360
I have to stop the bleeding.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.650
We need to move, fast, before more Infernals come.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.990
Kotatsu-san, you should get away by yourself...

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.830
I don't think I can stand up anymore...

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.540
I can't feel my left leg... I think it's probably...

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.040
There's no way I'm leaving you here!

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.010
You should get away from here, quickly...

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.430
If you try... to carry a big lug like me with you... it'll slow you down...

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.690
It feels like now, at the end, I was as big a man on the inside as on the outside...

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.410
Yeah, you were amazing! You defeated a White-Clad all by yourself!

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:46.370
It's all thanks to you... that I was able to avenge Hajiki-senpai...

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:54.420
You gave me courage... You made me a man...

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.300
That's why I have no regrets...

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.720
I would like to have seen my potato fields back home one last time, though...

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.400
But having you watch over me... that seems like asking too much...

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.400
I couldn't ask for more than to pass in the Nether... like a potato...

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.990
You dummy! You dug your potatoes up, didn't you?!

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.700
Potatoes have to last until they're above ground!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.750
Juggernaut...?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.010
I swear I will take Juggernaut back to the surface!

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.690
"Episode 21: Enemy Contact"

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.900
We're dead! Damn it!

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.160
Fire! Fire! He's already dead!

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.950
This is the doing of the Evangelist's men.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.790
--Maki was fighting people as dangerous as this? --Not you, too! No!

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.040
I assume you had Maki safely supporting the rest of you from the rear?

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.000
We had her on the front line as a meat shield, naturally.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.760
You used my sister as a meat shield?!

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.220
We're on the battlefield. Please pay attention.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.970
You just told me the most outrageous--

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.350
It's just one thing after another.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.860
Now what?

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.910
I am Iron, Knight of the Purple Haze! I will burn away you surface scum!

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.870
He's a White-Clad.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.880
To announce himself on the battlefield like that,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.880
he must be Arthur levels of stupid.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.260
Hmm? Were those mosquito bites or something?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.050
My gun had no effect. What's going on here?

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.260
I have a lot more questions to ask you about Maki. Stay behind me.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.230
Wishful thinking! You cannot even scratch my steely body with that thing!

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.570
The squad has gone into complete panic mode.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.080
How many are dead? Lives are being lost way too easily.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.750
Concentrate. Feel the life around you.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Who's there?!

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.020
Long time, Shinra Kusakabe.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.980
Dr. Giovanni!

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.150
What are you scheming down here in the Nether?!

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.360
Was the lab that Detective Oze discovered one of yours?!

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.990
How many have you killed?! What are you trying to do?! Answer me!

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.370
The lab was nothing more than chum in the water.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.540
And the Fire Force fell for the trap, hook, line, and sinker.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.410
What?!

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.170
And now, Shinra Kusakabe,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.420
you will come and join us, along with your brother.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.010
Where is Sho?!

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.970
I came customized for combat. Not like anything you've seen before.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.810
What was that?!

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.900
I told you, I'm not like anything you've seen before.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.860
This body has an increased affinity with the Insects.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.240
Affinity? What did you... ...do to your body?

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.620
I hear the 2nd and the 8th

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.460
are conducting a joint large-scale investigation in the Nether.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.580
Are we finally going to find out who the White-Clad are?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.630
Not the Nether again...

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.220
Crewman Kusakabe, are you all right?!

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.890
Stay out of this.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:41.640
What do you take people for? What have you done to your body?!

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.070
Insect legs?

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.070
Damn it, now we're up against monsters?!

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.870
Fire! Fire!

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.840
Get back, please! I'll take this one!

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.140
Evacuating the wounded takes first priority.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.760
I have to draw Dr. Giovanni away.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.270
You insist on protecting the wounded?

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:26.730
Our objective here is you. Why don't you worry about yourself?

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.690
If I use my speed to close the distance in a flash and hammer him--

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.900
No matter how much faith you place in your speed,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.070
you have to do better than just charge into me.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.080
How did he know what I was thinking?

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.870
Hair-pencils.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.250
Organs that only male moths possess, which utilize pheromones.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.920
They are able to release and detect pheromones.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.550
I took this capability, expanded upon it,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:58.430
and developed the ability to read human emotional and psychological states.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:05.100
I know what you're thinking. You might say a little bug told me.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.230
What is it with you and Insects? What are those things?!

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.280
I'm sure you've heard the theory, right?

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.070
About how Insects are an extraterrestrial life form

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.620
who landed here as eggs attached to a meteor? Just as that theory states,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.370
the Insects are not of this world.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.250
They are creatures from Adolla.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.420
I have been performing experiments to prove that if you fuse an Adollan Insect

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.710
with a human being, they can get closer to Adolla.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.260
You mean you experimented on yourself

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.050
to alter your compatibility with Insects and Adolla?!

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:44.560
No need to be impatient; I will show you the results of my experiments!

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.810
This is a time for the Knight King himself to bring up the rear.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.900
Take the wounded and find an exit to the surface at once.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.240
Thanks a million.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.670
In battle, I am a one-man army! My sword possessed with a divine frenzy!

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.760
He left us.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.890
What does he think bringing up the rear means?

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.430
He missed one of them!

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.190
Fall back! Fall back!

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.030
I won't let you get away with this!

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:40.530
What are you talking about? You're all caught in our trap.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.500
The plasma user...?

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.420
Arthur! What are you doing here? What happened to your squad?

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.130
The Knight King brought up their rear to let them get away.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.470
Are you sure the "rear" is supposed to come way up here?

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.180
Hmph, what does a fool like you know about the rear guard, anyway?

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:09.890
There are now two of you? No matter.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.610
I was just wondering what I was going to do with all these legs.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.410
Please stay behind me! This one is dangerous!

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.250
No, you stay behind me!

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.050
"Martensite"

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.270
He repelled them?

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.560
Sergeant, are you sure you even hit him?!

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.980
I'm beginning to have doubts about your marksmanship!

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.070
You lured Maki over to the Fire Force, when she's not cut out for that work.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.900
Your eye for judging people is as off the mark as your aim.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.330
That steam is out of this world.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.040
He must be a type of third generation pyrokinetic

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.210
who uses his pyrokinesis within his body.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.630
That won't work! That won't work!

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:21.050
My steely body is as hard as nails!

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.130
Martensite!

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.430
Are you kidding me?! What is up with this guy's body?!

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.270
His body can repel bullets and smash through pillars.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.570
His body is exceptionally hardened.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.030
Ironclad reasoning! You are correct!

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.830
You've heard of the tempering that takes place with metal, right?

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.160
By heating metal to a high temperature,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.710
and then rapidly cooling it,

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:00.550
the metal forms an extremely tough martensite structure.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.090
Its hardness is greater than before it was heated.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.350
Using my pyrokinetic abilities, I heat the iron content within me.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.890
Then, by quickly cooling myself, I can manipulate the hardness of my body!

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.270
But I am not merely hardened!

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:20.610
In a sense, I have an unyielding, tough-as-steel body!

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.870
Hey, Sergeant, are these the kinds of monsters that Maki has been fighting?

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.030
We learned man-to-man combat in the military, too.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.620
Man-to-man? Against someone like that?!

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.670
If your opponent has joints in his limbs, nothing else about him matters.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.500
Sergeant!

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.090
I am a lieutenant with the 8th, now.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.260
Flames! Extra-hard!

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.850
We'll come back to Maki later; right now, focus on the enemy in front of us!

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.980
At least I wish I could, but I can't until I get some questions answered!

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.520
Please try to focus.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.770
You don't understand a thing about Maki! She's a gentle flower garden of a girl!

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.110
--Don't drag her into this weirdness! --Try to focus.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.030
The Special Fire Force claims to put lives first,

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:11.780
but what you do at the 8th is simply go berserk with fighting!

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.450
I don't want you bunch of barbarians involved with the Oze family!

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.500
The 8th is not some pack of berserkers.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.000
I mean, I might be, but the 8th is different.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.130
You're savages who can only do your work through violence.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.180
Watch out! Please step back!

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.350
I was right to leave Maki behind!

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.850
I'm never letting her get near a situation like this again!

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.110
Maki is no longer the delicate girl you think she is, Lieutenant Oze!

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.570
No, I'd guess not! Not after being with barbarians like you, Sergeant!

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.490
Flames! Extra-crispy-hard!

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.580
How long are you going to use that wimpy pea-shooter?

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.040
You get it already, don't you?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.090
If I'm going to hit his weak points,

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.720
I have to shoot with absolute accuracy, before his guard is up.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.010
Flaming crispy-hard fist!

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.600
Shut up! I'm trying to talk about my sister here!

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.560
I'm sick of your flames, and I'm going to strip them away!

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.650
You're the one who needs to shut up, Lieutenant Oze.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.480
Ricochet Control!

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.570
"Ricochet Control"

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.200
I don't care how hard you make your body,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.040
you can't harden your joints, too, if you want to move about.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.960
Yeah, that's true. That's why I couldn't be a protector...

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.550
...despite being this rock-hard...

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.220
If we had left Maki there at the 8th,

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.230
she might have become as buff as this guy.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.650
Butt out of the Oze family.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.610
Please try to focus.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.700
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.740
May thy soul...

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.080
...return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.040
Damn it, there's no end to them.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:32.840
Juggernaut... I swear, I'm taking you out of here.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.560
I don't see Orochi around. Where is she?

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.730
Two more of those pointy hoods?

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.310
What's this? There's a straggler.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.900
Girl, are you the one who finished Orochi?

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.110
I'm no match!

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.120
There's no way I can beat them... I have no choice but to run...

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.750
Just me, by myself?

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.590
No way! I can't leave Juggernaut behind!

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.900
I'm impressed that a nobody like you lasted this long in here.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.150
You must have been saved by something, and lucky enough to live.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.150
Die!

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.620
Tamaki! Are you all right?!

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.960
Thank God!

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.590
Juggernaut...

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.130
Way to hang in there! Well done!

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.180
Now, stay behind me.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:04.220
Captain... Hmm, "Captain"?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.360
This saves us some trouble. We were just about to come hunting you.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.900
Bring it on.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.320
Captain of the 8th,

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.360
what does an unpowered like you plan to do against us, who can control flames?

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.120
Captain Obi, keep back!

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.330
Hmph, come back to the Nether when you can make a match's worth of fire!

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.210
Whoo!

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.060
I train for this!

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.560
Every day, until I breathe fire!

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.650
Sasori was taken out with one blow.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:55.230
I beg your pardon. Even without powers, you're still the captain of the 8th.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.950
No matter! I will not go down so easily!

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.030
Gwah!

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.290
Dosukoi!

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.830
Th-They're so strong.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.460
They aren't the captains for nothing.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:19.050
We were worried when we lost contact with Lieutenant Kagenashi.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.300
I'm glad you're all right.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:26.850
I was pathetic. All I ever do is have others protect me.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.100
Even now, if you and the others hadn't come along...

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:35.690
Must be your "lucky delivery," huh, Tamaki?

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.240
--Wah! I...! I...! --Whoa, I-I'm sorry.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.240
Vulcan-san, that was the wrong call. This isn't the time.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.830
No, survival is what makes the Fire Soldier.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.250
And Tamaki, you are a fine Fire Soldier.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.880
You've lived to thwart the enemy's plans!

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.130
Yes, sir!

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.350
Attention, all Special Fire Force Company 2 personnel!

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.810
All squads, assemble!

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:18.070
I've long been told that the way I run is funny. I've been laughed at.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:23.530
That's why I hate running! But if I don't run away, I'll get killed...

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.700
...by Infernals!

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.290
I don't want to die before learning the truth of this world!

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:33.250
So I have to run! Even if I do run funny!

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.260
Crewman Tamaki!

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.510
Licht-san?!

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.470
--Hey, watch your hands! --First lechery, then delivery, then lechery again. She's having a busy day.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.550
--I don't even care about that! My life is saved! --First lechery, then delivery, then lechery again. She's having a busy day.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.350
--I don't even care about that! My life is saved! --If you're gonna get lechered, you could at least be grateful!

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.560
Licht, where is Lieutenant Ohana?

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:59.650
Oh, the squad was wiped out. I'm the only one who escaped with his life.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.950
I see.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.240
You got here just in time. Take a look at this.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.410
Not even a moment to catch my breath, huh?

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.710
It's a graph of the thermal sensors each squad placed.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:17.130
Heat sources that I believe to be Infernals are located at regular intervals.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.380
Do mindless Infernals behave in such an orderly fashion?

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.180
I can't tell for sure from just this, but it is eerie, huh?

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.010
The attacks by Infernals have suddenly stopped, and they've fallen quiet.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:35.600
The heat energy of Infernals, each lined up at regular intervals...

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.520
--The enemy is planning to blow up the Nether facilities! --They're what?!

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.440
This is bad! We have to do something fast, or this will be a disaster!

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:54.160
What fools. You did not even know you were being lured right into the Nether.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.620
With my ability, Necro Pyro,

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.460
I will sink all of Tokyo into the ground.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.460
I can make up the energy I was lacking

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.050
by using the Fire Soldiers that have become Infernals.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.890
They didn't even know they were being lured in,

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:15.140
and now, luckily for us, they waltz on down here in large numbers,

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.520
as human bombs.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:23.570
All that remains now is to secure the Fourth Pillar, Shinra Kusakabe.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.500
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.750
"Next time"

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:02.370
The Tokyo Empire will be laid to waste.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:10.010
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 22, "Plot for Extinction."

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:13.530
"Episode 22: Plot for Extinction"

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.530
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.530
