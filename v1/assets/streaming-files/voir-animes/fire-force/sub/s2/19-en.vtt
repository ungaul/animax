00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.810
Y-- You're leaving the military?

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.060
There's a new unit that's shorthanded,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.900
and the sense I got was that they would take whoever they could,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.820
so I thought that even a novice like myself could be of help to them.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.530
But your work in the military is worthwhile, too, isn't it?

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.030
Mm-mm.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.660
I want to join the Special Fire Force and be someone who protects others.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.430
General Oze, we've received a periodic report from the Special Fire Force.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.600
Mm-hmm.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.070
A periodic report...

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.030
...from the Special Fire Force, you say?

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.070
Hmm?

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.410
Y-Yes, sir.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.790
That was terrifying.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.080
Hmm? Something the matter?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.630
Oh, I was delivering the Special Fire Force's periodic report,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.130
and General Oze was rather imposing.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.260
Ah, that explains it.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.550
His daughter sure was cute, huh?

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.510
She's stationed at Yokota Air Base, isn't she?

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.230
No, she's left the military.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.350
I hear she went against General Oze's objections

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.150
and joined Special Fire Force Company 8.

I'm home.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.610
My, you're home early today.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.980
I had the early shift, and my relief came in early, too.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.820
I'll take your coat.

It's been some time since the whole family has gotten together, hasn't it?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.880
Yeah, it sure has.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.180
Wow, this looks so good!

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.260
Mom, this is quite a feast!

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.180
We're all eating together today, so... Danro-san!

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.350
Dad!

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.650
It's been a long time since we've eaten together, huh, Maki-chan?

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.530
Mom really went all-out. Do you think we can eat all this?

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.830
General Oze, the Empire's Nio Guardian,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.160
is putty in the hands of his daughter when she's around.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.330
Ahem! Takigi, I see you're home.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.540
Being a general at home, too, would be exhausting.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.210
Okay, dig in before it gets cold.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.760
Delicious!

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.340
Mm-hmm, this is good, Mom.

Nothing is better than dinner with the whole family.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.350
I'll bet the lieutenant is the only one who can rival Mom's cooking.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.150
The lieutenant? Hinawa, wasn't it?

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.900
That's the man who lured you into that dangerous Fire Force job, right?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.820
It's all right. I'm not as fragile as I was before.

No I haven't.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.540

--That's not true at all! You can't just say whatever--

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.630
--Takigi, --That's not true at all! You can't just say whatever--

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.380
it's bad manners to point at someone with your fork.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.590
He's right, though. Maki-chan, are you sure you aren't overdoing your training?

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.760
You're going to scare off any suitors.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.850
You really are an awful brother!

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.190
Someday, a prince on a white horse will come along and fall in love with me!

Maki-chan may be macho on the outside,

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.320
but she still has a flower garden for a mind, and is adorable!

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.980
There's where she gets her dual personality.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.820
It's bad manners to get so giddy while eating.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.740
Oh, it's my girl.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.700

--Pleasant conversation is nice and all, --Maki-chan, you'll always be Daddy's baby.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.670
--but let's observe some manners, okay? --Maki-chan, you'll always be Daddy's baby.

Thanks.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.280
Maki, you said you've been to the Nether before.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.110
Mm-hmm.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.610
This guy you're currently after?

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.080
Mm-hmm. There's an area where we've had a string of people going missing.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.620
Now we're getting reports of strange smells coming from the Nether around there.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.750
The Nether is scary.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.590
I've heard that the 8th once had a large-scale engagement in the Nether.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.510
Stories have made their way back to the military.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.600
Those investigations are an unavoidable part of our duty as Fire Soldiers.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.310
Are you all right?

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.570
The 8th is incredibly strong.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.440
The captain and lieutenant are, of course,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.280
but our rookies are also the cream of the crop,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.200
and we have the finest engineer in the world with us, too.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.850
We can access the Nether through here, right?

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.680
I never thought we'd get a search warrant.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.230
I guess it shows how important things are to the Empire

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.980
in matters relating to the Evangelist.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.900
You visited your home yesterday, right?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.280
It's the first dinner we've had as a whole family in a long time.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.910
Maki-chan came, too, right? Did she say anything about the Nether?

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.280
Yeah.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.450
She said she never wanted to come here again.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.040
For real?

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.630
Watch yourself.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.510
It looks so deteriorated down here.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.800
The reports said there were strange smells coming from the Nether.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.550
There are a ton of underground facilities throughout the empire

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.680
left over from before the Cataclysm.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.270
Whoa, I am actually in the Nether.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.190
My late mother would turn over in her grave.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.230
The source of the smell from the report was over that way.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.780
There are so many turnoffs here. The place is like a maze.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.700
If we're likely to get lost, we should turn back rather than be heroes.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.000
I'm with you.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080
Hold up.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.710
There are tracks in the dust, like something was dragged through here.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.380
They're still fresh.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.550
They keep on going that way.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.130
"Equipment Room"

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.880
An equipment room.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.050
In here?

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.220
I hear something.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.240
What is all this?

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.030
What is that for?

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.120
Is this some kind of laboratory?

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.790
I don't know.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.290
As I'm sure you know, the military has no intel at all about this.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.800
Take a look at this.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.180
An Insect?

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:42.100
I did some independent research on these, but I never expected to see one.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.020
Apparently, the White-Clad use these Insects to artificially create Infernals.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.860
Then this really is a White-Clad lab?

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.900
The odds are good.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.690
Let's see if there's anything else here.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.690
Yeah.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.610
Who's there?!

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.990
There's someone back there. Stay sharp.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.490
R-Right.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.580
A charred body?

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.750
No, that's an Infernal.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.670
What's going on here? Its core is still intact, but it's dead.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.220
Come on out! We know you're in there!

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.720
--Bomb! --Get back!

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.910

"Holy Sol Hospital"

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.370
Burns to the right arm, left arm fractured,

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.130
facial lacerations, and bruises from head to toe.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.130
It will take three months before you're all healed,

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.510
but you're lucky to be alive at all.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.180
You came through okay?

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.050
Just some scratches, thanks to you.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.890
What's the status of the scene?

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.390
The blast from the suicide bomber blew just about everything up.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.150
So those are the White-Clad.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.570
If they'll even blow themselves up, they're more dangerous than I imagined.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:21.110
This is the crowd that Maki-chan is taking on?

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:27.330
This man, Lieutenant Hinawa, recruited Maki to a fight like this?

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.290
I see.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.040
So my son is all right.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.630
But what the hell is down in the Nether?

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.670
All military organizations thus far

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.510
have been kept out of the loop when it comes to matters of the White-Clad.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.560
However,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:53.940
as defenders of the empire, we can't afford to be left out in the cold anymore!

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.860
Get me Honda, from Special Fire Force Company 2!

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.990
He must be getting tired of sitting around on this, too!

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.410
I'm giving the 2nd a mission to investigate the Nether!

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.970
Sil-burro, nice security work again today.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.970
You're always at that, huh?

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.430
Sil-burro was a traumatized donkey

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.520
who sprouted bull's horns, thanks to Hinawa's wicked experiments.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.140
Now that the benevolent Knight King has taken him in, he is happy.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.560
Oh! Oh!

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.530
Wha--? You've gone and stuffed trash into Sil-burro's mouth again!

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.400
Confounded devil! You're so low you would abuse animals like that?!

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.660
Take it down! That thing is so ugly!

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.700
--And the trash thing wasn't me!

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.160
--They're fighting again. --And the trash thing wasn't me!

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.120
--They're fighting again. --You expect me to trust anything you say?!

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.000
--Here, Sil-burro-chan, it's feeding time. --My trash can is right there!

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.460
I told you it wasn't me!

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.380
--Hmph! Your deeds every day are evil! What do you expect?!

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.420
--Vulcan-san said that donkeys don't eat paper. --Hmph! Your deeds every day are evil! What do you expect?!

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.170
We're not supposed to feed it to goats, either.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.800
Even though the black goat eats his mail?

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.140
It's like this every morning at the 8th, huh?

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.680
Everyone here's an idiot.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.890
Hinawa...

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.180
A moment?

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.310
Take a look at this. It arrived this morning from the Imperial Armed Forces.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.410
A mission to investigate testing facilities in the Nether...

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.030
Does this mean the military is going into the Nether?

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:33.200
Specifically, it's a joint operation between the 2nd and the 8th.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.710
They've requested our assistance.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.250
No doubt because we've had previous experience in the Nether.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:44.720
Right. But the issue is what's written at the bottom of the page.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.760
The crew members of the 8th belong to the Fire Defense Agency.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.020
We can refuse a request from the military.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.270
Hinawa, what should we do?

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.940
What is it, sir?

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.620
Okay. The Tokyo Imperial Armed Forces...

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.620
"...the return of Maki Oze..."

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.830
J-Just a minute, sir. This is...

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.080
...an order for you to return to the military.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.670
But I'm no longer in the military; I'm a Fire Soldier!

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:26.010
Yes, exactly right. But this comes straight from your father, General Oze.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.430
That has nothing to do with it. Obviously I'm staying with the 8th.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.560
I understand your brother in CID was badly hurt investigating in the Nether.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.770
It wasn't anything life-threatening, sir.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.600
The actions of the White-Clad are getting more extreme by the day.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.150
Your father is probably just worried about you.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:48.070
I'm sure, but I'll be fine.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:53.950
I'm proud of the Special Fire Force that the lieutenant recruited me for.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.000
Isn't that right, sir?

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.540
Maki, go back to the military.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.380
Huh?

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.550
A joint operation with the 8th?

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.180
I hear it's supposed to be a large-scale investigation of the Nether.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.430
Hajiki-senpai!

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.850
We're going to uncover the White-Clad's testing facilities.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.770
I sure hope Tamaki-san is coming, too.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.400
--Hmm? --Oh, nothing!

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.360
I can't get this lid open!

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.700
Good morning.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.240
What are you doing?

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.490
The lid on this jar tightens up in no time,

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.710
so I always had Maki-san open it for me.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.830
Isn't a same-day return a little sudden?

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.930
Maki is the daughter of an Imperial Armed Forces general.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.300
This is probably a way to ensure she doesn't join the mission--

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.680
Oh, sorry.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.270
This is why I always asked Maki-san to do it. You're too strong.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.320
So, when is Maki coming back?

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.110
--Maki-san... isn't ever coming back. --Nuh-uh.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.280
M-Maki-san decided this on her own-- I'm not listening!

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.870
--Maki-san decided this on-- --Ah!

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.710
What is wrong with you? Are you a child?

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.590
I don't want-- No one wants to admit it...

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.050
"Tokyo Imperial Armed Forces, Secretarial Division"

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.260
11:00, huh?

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.430
Ordinarily, we'd finish our office work

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.560
and start training now.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.280
Me, return to the military?

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.330
The White-Clad's activities are becoming more extreme.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.290
This is no mission for Daddy's precious girl.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.750
Very well, sir.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:17.550
The lieutenant still thinks I'm not up to the task.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.890
Secretary Oze, I am Captain Hiraoka! Thank you for working so hard!

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.270
Good morning, Captain Hiraoka.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:32.030
Ugh, they're treating me with kid gloves.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.110
Wasn't that General Oze's...?

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.860
Yeah. Isn't she adorable?

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.280
Our Nio Guardian has fathered a celestial maiden.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.790
Good morning.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.750
Did you have this morning off?

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.920
Well, we have so little to do. Nice, relaxed workplace, isn't it?

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.300
We're surrounded by our choice of the military's elite, and the pay is great.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.430
This is peak princess's privilege.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.180
Yes it is.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:06.480
We both grew up always being told how cute we were by everyone around us,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:12.020
coddled and loved, which is why we're so much more agreeable than others.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.650
Plus we're thoughtful,

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.610
making us the perfect people to place in the elite's showcase, right?

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.330
Welcome to the stereotype, where we actually do type.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.920
Go back to the military.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.930
What's that? Your insignia from the 8th?

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:43.600
Oh, this? Y-Yes it is. It was a going-away present.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.860
Good morning, Maki-chan.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.530
G-General Oze? Huh? "Maki-chan"?

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:02.830
General Oze, the Nio Guardian of the Empire, calls his daughter Maki-chan?

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.910
I'll just step out for a bit, okay?

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.330
Thank you.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.130
I'm glad you've come back.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.050
I just returned to where I should be.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.840
Gotta keep your bird in her cage.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.390
Maki-chan, you're upset at me.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.310
You promised me you would be keeping people safe,

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.770
but committing yourself to dangerous battles wasn't part of the agreement.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:35.940
But I know you aren't the kind of girl who breaks her promises.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.280
You were tricked by Lieutenant Hinawa at the 8th, weren't you?

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.620
Whatever the case, it's a relief having you back here.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.540
We'll talk about it when there's more time.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:05.470
Dad isn't at fault here. He was just worried about me.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.600
The same goes for Lieutenant Hinawa.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.190
I'm the disappointment for always being so unacceptable.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:21.360
I was trying so hard, too. They're both so demanding.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.410
Training isn't something you work hard to get through.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.080
You need to get through it with ease.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.200
Yeah, demanding, all right.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.670
Maybe I'm driving myself too hard.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.960
Even birds in their cages have concerns.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.670
The rest of the world wouldn't understand.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.560
"Special Fire Force Company 2, Captain" "Gustav Honda"

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.850
I'm training my head and neck.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.440
Don't mind me, please begin.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.030
All right, the things to be mindful of on this mission are--

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.110
Mm-hmm, continue.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.790
There are many facilities in Tokyo's Nether,

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.250
but most of them collapsed during the Great Cataclysm,

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.000
were buried under rubble, and are inaccessible without digging them out.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.710
As such, we are looking for a location that can be easily reached,

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.630
and does not require excavation.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.340
This narrows down the points we need to search.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.140
These locations were proposed by Lieutenant Oze, of CID.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.930
Mm-hmm.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:35.390
If we investigate each one in turn, we run the risk of tipping the enemy off.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.230
We believe the best plan is to begin searching each area in unison.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.110
In that case, we will deploy multiple companies at once.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.030
I'm Lieutenant Ayabe.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.870
In that case, since the 8th has experience in the Nether,

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.830
we should have you split up and place someone in each company.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:56.120
All right then, please have each company investigate these points simultaneously.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.420
Mm-hmm!

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.880
Attention, Special Fire Force Company 2!

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.510
This is an order to all units!

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:09.390
Tomorrow morning at 0800, we begin Operation Nether Investigation!

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.430
Those of us from the 8th

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.520
will be mobilizing separately with companies from the 2nd?

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.520
Mm-hmm. This will be our first mission without Maki.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.270
Let's all keep on our toes!

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.360
--Yes, sir! --Yes, sir!

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.990
"2nd-8th joint mission, Operation Nether Lab Investigation" "Begins"

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.500
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.790
"Next time"

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.580
Both of you, stay behind me.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:10.090
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 20, "Weapons of Destruction."

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:13.530
"Episode 20: Weapons of Destruction"

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.530
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.
