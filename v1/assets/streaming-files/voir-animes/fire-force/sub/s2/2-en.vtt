00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.190
This is the photo from our nude calendar from earlier.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.020
What a provocative expression. Way to go, Shinra!

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.166
Give me a break, sir.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.110
I'm just smiling out of anxiety from having a camera pointed at me.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.886
Well, down to business.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.466
You're going to get your sit-down with Captain Hague of the 4th.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.386
If what you say is true,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.936
he could be a lead on the identity of the Evangelist,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.330
and to unraveling the mystery of Adolla Bursts.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.540
Do you mean it, sir?

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.896
It's unusual for a Second Class Fire Soldier to have a personal meeting

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.486
with the captain of another company,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.446
but then, you also have the support of Lieutenant Asako.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.010
The lieutenant says she will accompany you to your meeting tomorrow.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.536
Shinra, do you know about the 4th?

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.036
Of course I do, sir. The 4th oversaw the academy I attended.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.730
But why does only the 4th have a training academy?

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.376
The Fire Defense Agency is directly over the 4th and regular Fire Fighters.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.876
"Fire Defense Agency"

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.376
"Special Fire Force Company 4"

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.966
"Fire Fighters"

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.756
The academy is under the Fire Defense Agency, and managed by the 4th.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.950
"Academy"

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.660
Just as you say you saw Captain Hague during your Adolla Link,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.970
Captain Hague may be interested in your Adolla Burst.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.460
Whatever his reasons, your meeting with him works in our favor.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.330
I'm counting on you, Shinra.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.930
The Adolla Burst boy...

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.996
"Episode 2: Flames of Madness"

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.206
"Special Fire Station 4: Special Fire Soldier Training Academy"

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.440
This sure takes me back.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.756
Begging your pardon.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.530
Forgive us for interrupting your training.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.596
Instructor Pan!

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.846
"Special Fire Force Company 4" "Special Fire Soldier Training Academy Instructor" "Purt Co Pan"

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.806
It's been a while, Kusakabe.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.790
Pardon me, it's Lieutenant Pan here.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.766
What are you doing here, Kusakabe?

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.260
I'll bet that toilet of the 8th flushed you away.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.970
Karin, a toilet bug like you stayed here without getting flushed?

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.350
Huh? What did you say, mother-killer?!

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.246
Don't they teach you here at the 4th

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.786
that if you grab someone carelessly, you get joint-locked and thrown?

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.586
Everyone at the 8th knows that.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.046
...What the hell do you think you're doing?! ...Hey, don't you insult us!

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.780
Just be grateful I didn't break it, you wuss.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.240
Take it easy. Remember, you're the one who started it.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.506
Kusakabe, you never change, do you?

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.370
Ogun!

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.266
I just had my guard down, that's all.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.040
Sounds like something you'd say, Karin.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.986
I'm sorry.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.220
You have to actually say that in words for people to understand you.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.906
The instructor's whistling is still the same.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.930
It looks like you know a lot of people here.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.376
This is Ogun. He was the head of our class.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.650
He didn't have any friends, so Arthur and I palled around with him.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.256
Arthur is no friend of mine, you know.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.410
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.716
I hear you're doing well over at the 8th.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.910
As are you.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.106
Lieutenant Pan says he's going to show us in. Thanks for your help.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.340
I'm surprised you could understand that.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.180
What business do you and the 8th have with the captain, Lieutenant Asako?

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.786
We want to hear from my grandfather about how,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.390
ever since he got those scars on his face, he's changed.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.020
Captain Hague is a great man.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.586
A leading figure, who rose up from the regular Fire Fighters

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.166
to become a member of the Special Fire Force.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.490
All of us here at the 4th look up to him.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.700
Even now, our feelings for him remain unchanged.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.016
The captain is up ahead. He asked for you to go in alone, Kusakabe.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.396
Just me?

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.710
I've told him that you'd like to ask about Adolla Bursts.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.670
I don't want to be in the way, so I'd best not go with you at first.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.390
All right. Well, then...

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.340
Excuse me, sir.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.416
Second Class Fire Soldier Shinra Kusakabe, from the 8th.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.400
Thank you very much for being gracious enough to see me today, sir.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.860
I've been expecting you. To begin with,

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.330
I'd like to see your flames.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.540
Would you mind burning me?

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.290
Oh, goodness.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.220
Forgive me, forgive me. That must have startled you. Not like that.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.860
Allow me to lay it out.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.130
I want you to burn me!

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.390
Eww... G-Go on, go on, go on, go on... Burn you?

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.560
Burn me as hard as you can!

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.770
That's right! Go ahead and burn him, just like he wants!

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.660
Burn him. Burn him. Burn him to death.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.400
Don't hold it in anymore.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.740
Kill that despicable demon. Go ahead and waste him.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.200
That demon was Mom. I can't possibly kill her.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.056
Then what's to become of the thirst for blood you've had for the last 12 years?

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.170
It's not just going to vanish that easily, you know. Right?

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.646
...Devil! ...Mother-killer! ...You disgust me!

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.356
You only put up with all of it because once you killed that demon,

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.820
it would feel so much better, right?

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.786
Are you just planning to wave away all that pent-up anger?

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.946
Start burning and find your relief.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.150
Like, "Yeah, I'm every bit the devil you say I am!"

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.006
Not so eager? After all, being a hero doesn't matter anymore, does it?

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.506
This whole world is one lie after another.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.530
There's no such damn thing as a hero in a world like this.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.346
Yeah, he's the one you want to kill the most right now, isn't he?

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.790
He decided for himself to hide everything from you.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.690
This is on him.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.000
Start burning.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.310
Start burning, and you'll feel better. All of it. Set it all free.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.890
Let go of all of that anger!

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.100
Sister...?

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.560
Plunge it all into your flames!

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.520
No, you're not the sister. Who are you?

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.030
That was an Adolla Link.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.716
Has my contact with you triggered it?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.636
So you saw a woman who looks like someone you know.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.040
I'd like to meet this angel.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.806
I want you to burn me even more now.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.830
Eep!

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.226
Captain Hague, have you gone through an Adolla Link, too?

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:14.550
If that's what you want to call it, then yes. It was a magnificent experience.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.826
Captain Burns had his eye burned out as his trade-off.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.406
Are those scars on your face yours?

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:28.546
I've fought like crazy all this time to keep people's lives and property safe.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:33.570
But on that day, two years ago, my way of thinking changed.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.096
The Great Fire was enough to swallow up the whole city.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.540
I thought I had saved so many lives,

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.500
but the truth is, I was unable to save so many more lives, wasn't I?

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.276
It was then that I felt a hope that was close to hopelessness...

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.486
A sense of liberation.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.366
It felt like everything had been saved.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.826
"Adolla Link"... Is that what that baptism is called?

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:10.086
What I saw was unlike the light of the sun preached by the Holy Sol Temple.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.250
The light I saw was the veritable light of God.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.450
To reach that divine realm is indeed the very salvation of mankind.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:25.490
These scars are my stigmata... Sacred scratches that have opened my eyes.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:31.066
Please, Kusakabe-kun, will you burn me with your holy flames?

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.436
I might be able to see that divine realm again.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:39.010
Captain Hague, do you think that otherworldly hellscape is God's world?

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.700
Whether it is Heaven or Hell is fine to me.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.866
The God and Devil that people conceive of

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.650
are both nothing more than a pale mockery of Adolla.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.956
I've seen the verity of it.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.876
I want to tell others that this is the truth!

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.346
I didn't feel any salvation in the Adolla Link that I experienced.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:06.016
It probably feels mundane to you, possessing an Adolla Burst as you do.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.260
However, I am just an ordinary man.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.030
I'm just a man, too.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.680
Mamoru-kun?

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.640
Shinra Kusakabe, I'll kill you.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:31.086
Karin, why? Are you that upset over me tossing you about earlier?

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.190
It's the perfect opportunity, right? If that's how he wants it, then kill him.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.966
What's come over all of you?

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.990
Kill him.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.426
You've got the perfect target to take it out on. Kill him.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.040
Free your anger. As hard as you can.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.960
Burn everything... Kusakabe-kun?

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.170
Come on, let's get to it!

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.260
Burn everything!

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.670
Do it.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.736
This is your Adolla Burst? It's so hot! Good! Good!

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.930
Grandpa!

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.406
We have our crewmen acting strangely here?!

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.616
Yeah, and Kusakabe-kun, as well.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.150
It's almost like they're possessed by something.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.416
...Mother-killer! ...Devil!

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.110
...You disgust me! ...Devil!

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.480
They said all that crap without even knowing anything...

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.280
No, I guess I was the one who didn't know.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.390
Enough. It doesn't matter.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.700
Die, all of you.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.000
You need to start behaving yourselves.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.236
I came to use the 4th's crewmen to get in Shinra's face,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.706
and now the First Pillar is using Shinra to go on a rampage.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.706
The First Pillar? Hey, Haumea, did you just say the First Pillar?!

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.746
Through an Adolla Link?!

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.610
Hey, tell me, is the First Pillar in contact with Shinra Kusakabe?!

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.923
...Charon, you are one damn annoying man! Die, you scum! ...Whoa! For

00:12:00.947 --> 00:12:04.346
real? The First Pillar has appeared? Through an Adolla Link, right?

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.266
Yeah! Through an Adolla Link! You know where the First Pillar is!

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.056
It's not as though she's actually here, though!

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.290
She's using an Adolla Link to possess Shinra.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.396
She has her sights set on Shinra's anger and resentment.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.736
She's taking out her anger by using Shinra.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.316
Shinra is synced in with his anger, too. Taking them on...

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:28.560
...are the slick fire-fighting elite old man, and the hotshot Buff user.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.810
"Heat Resistance Buff"

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.690
I don't want things to get too rough inside my office.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.900
We can't very well have a fire break out at the fire station.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.240
Type 1 Fire Axes!

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.700
Almost as though you're a beast wearing a human form.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.910
There's no need to hold back anymore.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.250
Let's kill anyone who gets in our way.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:58.590
How does she have this much hatred? Who is this?

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.300
I'm getting swallowed up!

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.486
Whoa-ho, that's hot! A-Adolla! Adolla!

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.956
What are you doing, Captain?! You should have been able to avoid that!

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.036
Very good... Yes, indeed...

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.206
But if I bask in it for too long, I'll never survive it.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.456
...But still, I really want it...

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.546
...Grandpa...? ...But still, I really want it...

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.336
Please pull it together, sir! You really will end up dead!

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:32.160
Dead, huh? For the 4th's sake, I can't afford to die just yet.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.910
Oh, that's amazing in its own right!

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.606
Even with his heat resistance boosted, he's not going to last like this.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.630
Dodge him!

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.130
Those flame spears...

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.236
That Shinra bastard thinks he can do whatever he wants here.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.826
I take my eyes off of him for a minute, and what does he do?

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.560
You're here just in time, Ogun!

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.446
And Arthur...?

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.770
We figured that shock lady we met in the Nether might come after Shinra again.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.690
My captain has asked me to be his bodyguard.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.176
What's with you? Is that really you, Shinra? What happened?

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.660
Is it that harebrained woman we met in the Nether? No...

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.186
I'm sensing yet another presence coming from inside you.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.330
Kill you... Kill you...

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.560
Your face is as ugly as ever, though.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.526
Time for a devil hunt.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.196
Hey, hold on. Let's think of a way to bring Shinra back to his senses.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.236
Easy enough to say, but how do we do that?

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.366
If Kusakabe-kun has become like this because of the effects of an Adolla Link,

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.786
we can either break the link, or...

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.996
Let's allow his two classmates to handle this, sir.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.456
I'll back you up! You two just focus on stopping Kusakabe!

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.480
Here he comes!

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.280
Are you kidding me? That was too fast to see...

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.886
I increased your durability with my muscle-boosting whistle.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.870
It still hurts like hell, though.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.830
No fair!

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.016
So that's his Rapid, huh? After actually taking one,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.356
our bodies can't move in time even if we do react.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.840
Both of you, leave the Buffs and recovery to me.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.776
All right, we'll fight him as a party. We'll tank on the front line!

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.430
"Buff" "Party Play" "SPD"

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.986
"Bard" "Pan"

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.430
I, Pan the Bard, will inspire the warriors with my magic flute.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.786
"Warrior" "Ogun"

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.930
I, Ogun the Warrior, will avenge everyone in the village!

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.246
"Shield of Masochism"

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.940
I'm Shield of Masochism, created by the dwarves.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.126
Wh-What the...?

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.416
Let's go, Knight King!

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.440
Yes, to strike down Satan!

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.660
Arthur, what's suddenly come over you? You're acting strange.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.346
Is he being controlled, like the others?

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.556
No, he's going beyond us.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.500
You mean he's playing knight like he always does?

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:44.396
But he looks even more obtuse than usual. He's going pretty deep, sir.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.240
What exactly could have pushed his button like this?

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.026
The Adolla Burst!

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.760
Force Shield!

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.310
Shield Bash!

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.286
Arthur! What do you think you're doing with the captain?!

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.376
Good work, Shield of Masochism.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.650
This has never happened to me before.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.570
Captain, stop enjoying this!

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.030
"Slump"

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.530
Hey, Shinra,

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.990
what happened to being a hero?

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.460
I burned up all that rubbish about being a hero.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.820
Do you really mean that? Or is that whoever's inside you?

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.276
What is that smile supposed to mean?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.940
Are you celebrating, because you can finally reveal your true self?

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.350
...Or do you seek the Knight King's aid? ...Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.036
I know where your mother is.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.520
...How you can see her again. ...Hey, Devil, you hear me?!

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.626
I'll give you three chances. I'll let you off three times.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.400
The fourth time, I'll slice you up. Come to your senses before then.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.176
Did you even hear me?

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.586
I'm giving you four chances!

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.970
("*Wrong) 4 times" "Right) 3 times"

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.096
That was your first one.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.936
You really are a damn powerhouse when you're delusional.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.840
What set you off like this?

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.856
I was born a Knight King. That's the way I was brought up.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.050
Knight King? Like, nobility?

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.260
What the hell kind of household did you grow up in?

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.930
Nobility, you say? Can royalty become nobility?

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.706
What kind of folk were we, exactly?

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.666
A fire that erupted at a restaurant was put out early yesterday morning.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:30.956
"Restaurant Fire" "Did food poisoning lead to the fire...?"

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.376
The restaurant that caught fire

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.166
...is still reeling from a recent outbreak of food poisoning.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.310
...They're talking about us on the news. What are we going to do?

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.176
Supper is ready, so go get your father.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.240
Affirmative.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.210
Hey, it's our last supper.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.880
Sounds like the family's finances have gone up in smoke.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.856
Something wrong, Arthur?

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.696
Why were you looking at the inside of your hat? Could you see something?

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.850
You always say the funniest things, Arthur.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.416
Well, okay. I was looking at a sky full of stars...

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.940
The whole universe inside this hat!

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.760
You liar, it's pitch black. You can't see a thing in here.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.610
Really?

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.676
I see a castle! It's your castle, Father!

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.040
A castle, huh? That's terrific!

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.080
There are lots of soldiers, too.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.960
What are you two doing?

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.460
Come, Arthur, the ball is starting.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.673
"To our dear son, Arthur, Your mother and father have gone on a journey to

00:18:54.697 --> 00:18:57.296
save the world! The castle is all yours!! As of today, you are the king!!!"

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.390
King?!

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.820
Ever since that day, I have been the Knight King.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.790
So, your parents just vanished, and left you abandon...

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.486
You have one chance left. Are you going to forsake being a hero and die?

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:21.140
I never needed that nonsense in the first place!

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.156
I really am going to have to go for the throat, or I'll be in danger myself.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.366
Heroes are obviously stronger and cooler!

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.360
Hmph, you idiot. Knights are cooler.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:38.546
We're not here to become either knights or heroes, but Fire Soldiers.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.820
I'm going to unmask you for who you really are someday, Devil.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.160
I have to be a hero.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.330
It was a promise I made to my family.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.790
I see.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.220
In that, at least, we are alike.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.766
I acknowledged you for keeping your oath, at least,

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.630
but in the end, you're still a devil!

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.340
If it means killing the demon that killed my old lady, then I'll be a devil!

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.446
But your mother was that demon, right?

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.016
Yeah, that's right.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.406
My old lady's gone, and the demon who I wanted dead is gone!

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.180
It's too much hassle, so I'm gonna burn everything now!

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:14.680
How do you figure? I don't understand. What about your brother, Sho?

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.546
...Shut up! ...Shut up!

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.586
Screw you! What am I supposed to do with the thirst for blood

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:20.756
I've felt for the last 12 years?! ...Burn it up! Let it burn! Burn it up!

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.926
...I'm going to take it out on this lame-ass world by burning it up!

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.870
I'll kill anybody who gets in my way!

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:28.386
Knight Kick!

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.910
"Knight Kick"

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:31.306
Knight Punch!

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.830
"Knight Punch"

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.976
We never did settle the question between knights and heroes,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.396
but you sure are weak, Devil!

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.856
What did you say?

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:38.936
Knight Head!

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.550
"Knight Head"

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.736
What do you know? The person I wanted to take vengeance on is someone I love!

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.946
Now who am I supposed to wanna kill to keep on living?!

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.866
Protect the ones who are important to you!

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.350
That's something that knights, heroes, and Fire Soldiers all do!

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.626
Even if you protect them, someday, their lives will pass on.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.860
Become someone who snuffs them out, instead.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.006
That way is much simpler and clear-cut, right?

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.950
Now, get up! Are you a hero, or are you a devil?!

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.160
Get up and answer me! What are you?!

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.620
And depending on how you answer, I'll cut you down!

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.040
That's it, burn him to death!

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.076
Am I a hero or am I a devil? Well, damn it...

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:35.600
I can't believe I seriously have to answer such a ridiculous question.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.900
I am a hero!

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.256
Get out of me!

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.006
Guess I'm out of luck. But I enjoyed that more than I expected.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.886
Wait! You said you would let me see my mother, right?

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.596
Does that mean my mom still actually exists?

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:59.056
Heh-heh, that's a good question. You rejected me, so I'm not telling.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.250
Wait!

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.566
Oh, one other thing.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:08.050
Haumea, Sho, Shinra... and now it looks like one more Pillar is about to be born.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.486
Pillar? You mean, a person who has an Adolla Burst?

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.200
I've become aware of the birth of this new Pillar.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.520
The Evangelist must have realized it, as well.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:24.966
The Fire Force or the Evangelist... Which one will obtain the Pillar?

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.346
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.710
"Next time"

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.836
The appearance of a new Adolla Burst is predicted

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.686
by the mysterious girl who threw Shinra-san for a loop.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.276
Word is that it might be the so-called Fireground Thief schoolgirl.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.776
It couldn't be! Her? Delinquent behavior is bad!

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.406
If you want, I'll get you out of here.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.906
That is, after you give me your valuables.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:23.996
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 3, "A New Flashpoint." "Episode 3: A New Flashpoint"

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.650
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.
