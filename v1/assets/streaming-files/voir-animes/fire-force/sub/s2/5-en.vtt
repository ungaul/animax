00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.546
Hey, Charon!

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.426
I've got my own hands full of trouble up here! Hurry up and grab the Pillar!

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.330
I read you, Haumea.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.210
Bastard!

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.750
This guy is pretty tough in his own right.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.526
This guy's a rock. No matter how hard I attack, he doesn't even flinch.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.890
It's almost like I'm not even hurting him.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.706
Again?!

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.310
SNAP!

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.216
Damn...

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.966
I'm not just not hurting him, he doesn't even have a scratch.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.830
Where is all the energy from my full-power kicks going?

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.016
Not to mention his explosive pyrokinetic ability...

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.080
All he has to do is walk and it triggers explosions.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.470
He's able to walk quietly, too. Did those explosions use up all his gas?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.680
If something seems out of place, then I need to reconsider it from square one.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.996
Energy that seems to just disappear... Explosions...

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.336
The way he explicitly calls it out when he uses his ability...

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.886
That first overblown explosion he made a show of at the start...

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.926
Because of all that,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.750
I made the unwarranted assumption that he has to be a third generation.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.830
What generation are you?

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.970
"Episode 5: Corna (Sign of the Devil)"

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.450
Step back and stay behind me.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.116
That is amazing.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.230
It's no big deal.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.546
Using your opponent's flames to turn heat into sound, and sound into cold.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.416
Second generations each have our own areas of specialty,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.426
but I've never seen anything like this.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.056
Lieutenant Hinawa, your ultra-fine flame control is something

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.886
I could never duplicate, either.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.056
You second generations sure do have some radical abilities.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.476
We may not be able to create our own flames,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.316
but if we're facing a third generation,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.026
we can still use their own flames to fight with.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.986
Which is the whole reason why our tactic when fighting a third generation

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.406
is to conceal what generation we are to get them to create their flames,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.390
and catch them off guard.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.890
So that's what's going on.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.206
You created a big extravagant explosion at the start

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.206
to give off the illusion of being a third generation.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.296
You convert the kinetic energy you receive from an attack into heat energy,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.176
and then release it to attack.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.016
You're a second generation, aren't you?!

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.266
I got tricked by your typical muscle-headed appearance.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.420
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.590
But then, so what if I am?!

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.236
He's right.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.026
Even after I've figured out the trick,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.970
it's not as though I'm any closer to landing any attacks.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.496
Unless I defeat this guy, I can't offer Inca any protection.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.756
But what do I do? Even if I do attack, he just sends it back as an explosion!

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.216
But if I stand here doing nothing, I'm just gonna get beaten up.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.386
What's the matter? Too afraid of my counters to attack?

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.040
You have to attack if you want to defeat your opponent!

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.556
Think!

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.226
As long as I don't lay a hand on him, he can't hit me back that hard...

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.170
Hey, guys!

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.720
No way...

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.490
STAMP!

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.090
Hold on...

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.196
That's it. It's all in the timing.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.786
He absorbs energy, then releases it. The moment he releases it,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.086
his second-generation control over flames is directed outward, not inward.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.916
If I can counter his counter just right...

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.950
I can't prove it will work, but it's still worth trying.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.700
And worth trying is all I have right now!

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.750
Using my Corna, here!

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.140
I'm going... ...to knock him flat!

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.326
CLAP!

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.610
Now!

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.296
Damn, it didn't work!

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.700
I could do it in Asakusa, but not here! What's different?!

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.466
Being psyched up!

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.670
I'm not psyched enough! Let's do this, damn it!

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.460
Blow up, damn you!

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:28.520
Damn... Why did Captain Obi even teach me about the Corna sign?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.546
The "Maloik Sign," the "Devil's Sign," "Corna"...

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.596
It goes by many different names,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.846
but the fingers sticking up look just like a devil's horns.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.226
When we Fire Soldiers lose heart, we're done for.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:50.026
This sign is used to inspire your heart and strengthen your feelings.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:55.156
But a devil, sir? I'm a hero, not a devil.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.736
Oh, just listen.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.826
It's a sign that musicians who performed music known as "rock"

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.906
used a long, long time ago.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:07.480
Nowadays, it only exists as audio in museums, but it is so cool.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.216
Whenever you get in a pinch, remember "rock" while making this sign,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.176
and it will inspire courage within you.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.990
Isn't that great? Kind of like your own trademark.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:29.380
I get the feeling that if I go down here, I'm not getting back up.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.300
If I mess up the timing even a little, it will all come back on me.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.430
Can I really get away with doing this and having it work?

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:51.706
I'm not freaking out. I'm just making sure of my odds of winning!

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.666
Which is the whole reason why I need the effort it takes to not fail,

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.046
and the courage it takes to succeed!

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.540
No matter how much I fight it, this "devil" thing keeps following me around.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.660
So I'll just be...

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.960
...a devil toward evil!

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.026
...Corna! ...CLAP!

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.470
No way...

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.850
Oh, crap...

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.730
Choke on the flames of Hell!

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.280
"Corna (Sign of the Devil)"

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.030
Charon-sama!

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.800
Rock &amp; roll!

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.970
"Episode 5: A Secret Plan"

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.860
Not Charon the Reflector... Let the girl go!

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.490
The Special Fire Force is taking her into protective custody.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.626
Damn, he's already broken out of that. I guess that didn't buy us much time.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.660
Everyone, please stand back.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.056
We'll create a firewall to protect us all from the flames!

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.920
Second generations, join forces and take a defensive position!

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.026
This is a demon...

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.106
How are we supposed to take down something like that?

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.576
The Special Fire Force has only defeated demons twice before.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.406
Once in Asakusa, when Lieutenant Konro used the ultra-high firepower of Crimson Moon,

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:36.336
and again in Asakusa, when Captain Shinmon used Crimson Moon.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.916
Theoretically, if we can generate that much firepower,

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.836
then putting a demon to rest might be possible.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.506
That scale of firepower? Licht, do you have any ideas?

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.636
You're asking me for ideas?

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.016
Why didn't you call the 7th in Asakusa to help us, sir?

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.476
I did call! But they never answer their phone!

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.306
We have all the flames we could ask for!

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.170
Should I freeze him again?

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.296
We have all the flames we could ask for...

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.376
Yes I do, sir!

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.166
A plan that will kill two birds with one stone...

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.176
Put out all the flames in town and defeat the demon!

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.046
Licht, how can we do that?

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.056
With a plan that uses all the second generations we have

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.830
and the layout of the town to round up the flames and the demon together!

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.750
Let's get started!

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.156
This is Yamazaki! Target point reached!

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.036
This is Yamamoto! In position!

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.286
Moritani here! Target point reached!

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.836
This is 2nd Platoon Leader Taguchi! Target point reached!

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.426
This is 5th Platoon Leader Tokuyama! We've all reached our target points, too!

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.836
Copy!

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.556
The platoons from the 2nd and 5th are all in position.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.136
Good. Hinawa, you've got the demon!

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.410
Roger!

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.380
Come on!

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.026
Hey, are you sure I don't have to do anything yet?

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.116
Lieutenant Karim, we're saving you for the finishing touch.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.576
The flames all over town are already burning out of control.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.576
If we could gather those flames into one place and extinguish them all at once...

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.246
It's easy to say the words, but how do we do that?

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.626
We have a good number of second generations on site

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.756
who are able to manipulate flames. We're going to take their power,

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.676
and combine it with this town's wind power.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.346
Wind?

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.426
Towns have several different kinds of wind.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.476
This town specifically has...

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.210
...the kind of valley winds that blow between high-rise buildings...

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.646
...and the kind of street winds that blow along main roads.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.116
The place where these two kinds of wind come together...

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.486
...is here, in the central square.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.616
It's the terminal point of this town

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.786
where winds blow in from both directions and combine together.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:19.746
Uh-huh...

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.536
By manipulating the flames from all over into the air currents,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.336
we can combine their abilities and the wind

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.716
to concentrate all the flames together.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.910
And then, the flames within the air currents will ultimately end up...

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.250
...in the central square, where Crewman Maki is waiting for them!

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.726
Please keep back! Get back!

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.566
Please keep back!

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.476
Evacuate to a safe location!

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.736
Everyone, please remain calm!

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.606
Oh, I'm begging you...

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.576
I was born and raised in this town!

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.520
Leave it to us. The Special Fire Force will safeguard your town!

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.496
In order to put the demon to rest,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.166
we create a certain phenomenon with those concentrated flames.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.046
Usually, whenever one of these appears, it's a disaster.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.966
But if Crewman Maki can keep it under control with her ability,

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:20.636
the two winds blowing into the square from two directions will feed the flames,

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.580
and create a vortex!

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.290
The phenomenon that arises from that...

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.196
"Firestorm"

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.616
...is a firestorm!

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.116
I've read about these in fire scene reports, but are you serious?

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.956
Did you actually create one?

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.576
Just as I figured! You're amazing, Maki-san! Leave it to our witch!

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.690
A flame tornado, just like Licht calculated...

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:55.200
So now, how do we get the demon inside the tornado?

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.766
Lieutenant Hinawa!

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.170
This is going to be no easy task.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.686
C'mon, big fella!

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.090
Ow, that's hot!

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.406
Whoo, that was hot...

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.866
Not again. Please don't get in over your head, sir.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.746
What do we do? The only way to throw him in is by force.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.416
Hinawa, you just keep his attention drawn.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.626
Vulcan, where are you?!

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.320
Arriving now, sir!

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.626
The Matchbox?

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.086
What do you have in mind?

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:40.346
It has that lame-brained fire extinguisher that Vulcan built.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.000
Huh? You're going to use that, sir?

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.750
I'll be ready in no time! Setting anchors!

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.446
I just need to keep this thing occupied until you're ready, then?

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.066
I'll help you with that!

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.510
Deploying extinguisher!

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.366
That dimwitted extinguisher with the water pressure so strong,

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.876
it also destroys the target being extinguished...

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.876
Captain, take the gunner's seat!

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.206
I-I'm going to shoot it?!

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.876
The aim assist function will automatically follow the sight.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.950
Captain, you just have to target the center and push the button.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.700
Are you sure about this?

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.790
Oh, this is... pretty hard...

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.210
Go on, Captain! Now! Hit the button!

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.316
Captain? What's the matter?

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.720
A-All right... Oh, is this it?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.496
Come on! Now! Do it now!

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.860
Okay, now! Shoot! Okay, now! Right there! Shoot! Huh?!

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.916
Hey, Captain Obi! What are you waiting for?! Just shoot!

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.586
I've never been good at these kinds of games!

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.346
All you have to do is shoot!

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.716
Shooting is what I have trouble with.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.846
Playing the games is harder than this!

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.410
Oh, is this it?

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.460
Ah, for the love of...!

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.526
Hey, Vulcan! What are you doing?!

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.236
Now it's harder than ever to aim, you know!

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.680
I'm making it so you can shoot without having to aim!

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.010
Gotcha!

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.496
There, he's right in front of you! Now shoot!

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.690
All right!

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:42.216
The estimated wind speed inside the firestorm is about 60 meters per second!

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.966
There's no way he can escape that!

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.806
Hinawa!

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.120
I'll take it from here, sir!

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.960
Trajectory Control!

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.590
This firestorm is testament to the bond among the Special Fire Force!

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.680
Come on, 8th, pull this off.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.496
Lieutenant Hinawa uses the flames of the firestorm

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.876
as fuel to accelerate the velocity of the projectile.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.150
The firestorm itself becomes like the barrel of a giant railgun!

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.160
From here on out, the Special Fire Force will become one.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.316
Lieutenant Karim, that's all I can do!

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.850
Well done! Let me take it from here!

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.496
That was Lieutenant Karim!

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.690
He stopped that huge fire in an instant!

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.466
I think I just made enough ice to last a lifetime.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.176
The 7th's captain and lieutenant

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.170
put to rest one of those demons by themselves? Those guys are beasts.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.170
It's over.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.146
That one was on the scale of the Great Fire two years ago,

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.946
and he kept the damage down to a minimum.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.890
Incredible. That's Captain Obi for you.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.640
So this is the strength of the 8th.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.586
You did well, Maki.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.336
Thank you very much, sir.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.586
How fantastic to see a firestorm this close up!

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.990
That cool breeze sure feels good.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.756
Fire Soldiers from companies other than the 8th also acted on this.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.750
Am I ever glad for that.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.396
That just leaves the Evangelist's people.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.790
Shinra, Arthur, it's up to you.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.946
What is that pillar of ice?

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.366
What exactly is happening?

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.826
It's scary!

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:16.940
You're the first person to ever deal any damage to me.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.110
I'm gonna lay another one on you!

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.476
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.750
"Next time"

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.896
Shinra-san fights desperately to protect the Fifth Pillar, Inca-san.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:12.486
But what does she want? Are you really sure about this?

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.560
In that case, be sure to come for me. I'll be waiting.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.536
"Episode 6" "The Time to Choose"

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:23.626
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 6, "The Time to Choose."

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:28.426
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.450
