WEBVTT

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.520
Lisa, hand me my gauge, would you?

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.900
Okay.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.150
--Here. --Thank you.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.780
Oh, are you making something new for us?

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.830
There's no telling when the Evangelist's people will show up again.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.790
There. Lisa, that's all for today.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.370
Okay. If you need anything else, just call.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.500
Yeah.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.170
She's put up with a ton of abuse from Haijima.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.380
And after how Dr. Giovani hurt Lisa,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.720
I'm going to make damn sure Haijima pays for what they did.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.510
Yeah, let's kick their asses.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.400
Shinra, before you enrolled at the training academy,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.770
you were at a Haijima facility, right?

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.230
You could be a spy!

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.070
Oh, yeah, maybe so. I could be a spy, if it meant being able to assassinate you.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.740
So you are a spy! Come at me!

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.080
You're coming at me, you idiot!

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.950
Did you think you could beat the Knight King's sword skills?!

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.330
You actually hit me!

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.540
You're the one who hit me first!

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.670
--You devil! Devil! Devil! --You stupid knight! Stupid knight!

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.890
Shinra, you were once at Haijima?

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.480
Hmm? Oh, yeah. When my abilities surfaced after the fire 12 years ago,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.650
there was a period where I couldn't control them very well.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.310
That was when...

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.820
...I underwent experiments at a Haijima pyrokinesis development institute.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.360
I can still remember how chilling it felt there.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.830
All the employees saw the children as nothing more than test subjects.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.410
I didn't feel the slightest bit of warmth from them.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.750
I didn't want for anything there, but it wasn't exactly cozy, either.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.330
Shinra-kun... Inspector Licht?!

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.540
I have a somewhat important matter I need to discuss,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.670
so I'd like to get everyone together.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.170
A-All right.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.180
Okay.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.980
"Episode 14: The Ashen Reaper"

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.280
So, what's this important matter you need to discuss?

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.660
This is extremely hard for me to say,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.370
and I apologize in advance, but I, Viktor Licht...

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.130
...am a Haijima spy, embedded here at the 8th.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.220
H-Huh? You seem underwhelmed.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.390
Mm-hmm, we knew.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.690
So why speak up now? You were never actually posted to the 8th.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.770
You've always been with Haijima, right?

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.980
Yes I have.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.610
Huh? Does that mean that Licht-san isn't one of us?

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.860
It's okay. As you were, Sister. Mm-hmm.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.450
Then that will speed this along.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.330
My primary objective in coming to the 8th

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.250
was to observe Shinra-kun and his Adolla Burst.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.290
Haijima has been looking for the next bearer of an Adolla Burst,

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.250
just like the Evangelist,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.340
and for that reason, I was sent here to spy on Shinra-kun.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.050
But Shinra was already at Haijima, right?

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.220
It seems like they let Shinra's Adolla Burst get away from them pretty easily.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.850
Yes, and that is what I would like to speak about.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.890
Shinra-kun, after your house burned down,

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.400
you were taken in by a Haijima pyrokinesis development institute, yes?

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.690
Yes, from when I was 5 until I was 12.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.240
At age 13, I enrolled at the Fire Force Training Academy.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.530
As it happens, they were researching Adolla Bursts at that facility.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.910
Nonetheless, the Haijima researchers there at the time

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.330
could not identify your flame as being an Adolla Burst.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.580
Heh, lightweight.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.880
What's so funny? You're the last person to laugh.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.340
This is where the issue arises.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.720
Once they discovered the fact that they passed over Shinra-kun,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.380
the facility has gotten a lot more radical with their experiments,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.970
enough so that people are getting hurt.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.730
So much so that some of the kids will never recover.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.810
And the thing that triggered all this was letting Shinra-kun get away.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.320
Oh, man... Because of me?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.820
And now, they've finally ordered me to bring Shinra-kun back.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.950
There's no way we can sell out one of our crewmen.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.620
It's dangerous, to be sure. Haijima is clearly out for Shinra-kun's Adolla Burst.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.420
However, I think of this as being a chance to investigate Haijima.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.710
None of Haijima's people know the nitty-gritty

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.760
of the pyrokinesis development facility, including me.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.550
If we agree to go in,

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.640
we may be able to find a connection between the facility and the Evangelist.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.810
You're a Haijima spy, aren't you?! I'm not about to trust you so quickly!

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.810
Hold on, Vulcan.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.850
If what Inspector Licht says is true,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.650
then I can't just leave the children there to suffer.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.900
Captain, I'm okay with this.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.860
What kind of hero am I if I can't keep children safe?

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.530
Shinra, don't rush into any decisions.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.080
It's going to take three years before the truth about Amaterasu goes public.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.210
In the meantime, the Evangelist's plans just keep moving forward.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.330
There's no time for playing it slow and easy.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.800
I mean, Sho is still... Inspector Licht,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.220
the most important question still remains.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.760
Whose side are you on, the 8th's, or Haijima's?

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.760
I'm on both sides.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.680
I'm with Haijima because I can research the truth.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.850
But right now, I'm partial to the 8th.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.060
The 8th seems like it's closer to the truth.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.030
It doesn't seem like you're really part of either one.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.990
Oh, that's a sharp observation.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:17.750
Shinra, I can't let you go to Haijima by yourself. It's too dangerous.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.830
All 8th personnel will be conducting an investigation of Haijima.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.540
--Yes, sir! --Yes, sir!

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.540
Commence "Operation Investigate Haijima Industries"!

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.000
--Roger! --Roger!

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.180
Nataku-kun, we're starting a combat test.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.850
Kurono-kun, are you ready?

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.160
Nataku, care to go a round with your Uncle Reaper?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
S-Sure.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.140
This will be the third combat test, huh?

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.600
He may be an unexpected surprise from that earlier incident,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.730
but don't break him, if you please.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.950
Okay, you may begin.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.870
Okay, you have another experiment with your Uncle Reaper today.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:49.000
U-Uncle Reaper... ...when will I be able to go home?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.300
You recognize this grim reaper symbol, right?

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.510
You're not going home until you're dead.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.470
This is your third test, too. It's about time I started fighting like I mean it.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.400
Nataku, you'll have to knuckle down, too, or you could go home in a coffin.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.860
I want you to show me your true power.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.240
Click!

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.910
Fire! I know you can do it! You can do it!

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.080
After all, you've been chosen by the Insects!

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.870
Show them how hot-blooded you are!

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.920
Show them how passionate you are!

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:33.170
Fire!!

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.220
I'm getting fired up!

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.970
That's it! Fire! Click!

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.300
"Click"

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.440
Fire!!

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.820
That's the spirit, that's the spirit! That's good! That's hot! Keep at it!

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.240
Breathe in, just like that! Shout it out from deep inside! Waah!

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.500
Let it out, let it out even more! I know you can do it! Let yourself roar!

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.510
"Raaaah"

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.010
Flame output rising. Still unable to detect an Adolla Burst.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.930
His mental state is growing unstable.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.520
From the trauma of that incident. What do we do, stop?

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.810
Shinra Kusakabe is said to have sparked his Adolla Burst

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.980
through actual combat and combat training.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.740
We continue. And if he breaks, that's that.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.780
It would be a shame, though.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.300
Come on, we're not done yet.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.140
This is Uncle Reaper's job, too.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.310
I need you to go along with this, or I can't work.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.320
It's hard enough just to watch. I'm surprised he can do this.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.530
I understand that to him, this is his true calling.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.240
He's got the skills it would take to fight in an actual combat unit,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.950
but apparently, he remains here by choice.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.950
Just so he can pick on children.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.210
His right arm is already carbonized from tephrosis,

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.460
but he still seeks to destroy even more.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.750
He's completely around the bend, isn't he?

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.840
But his abilities are the real deal.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.340
Apparently, he rivals even the captain of the 7th.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.510
Kurono-kun, that's good. That was plenty.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.200
Good work in there, Kurono-kun.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.660
Wow, I'm impressed. You don't feel weird about beating up kids?

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.460
I love bullying the weak.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.420
The weaker they are, the less I have to worry about myself getting hurt.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.260
So that's why you're so willing to go along with what we adults say.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.550
You are really getting on my nerves now.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.680
Don't you know that when I say "weak," that includes you?

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.560
I am ridiculously powerful against the weak.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.520
Sorry about that! He didn't know!

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.400
Oh, sorry.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.530
I heard that Shinra Kusakabe would be coming here.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.540
Naturally, he's going to be facing me, right?

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.170
He's weak, after all.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.550
Shinra-kun, thanks for coming.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.050
Think nothing of it. When you spoke about the facility,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.390
it reminded me of someone who was there.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.980
A guy who was at the facility being treated for tephrosis.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.020
I remember how depraved he was, even now.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.040
--What the...? Hey, what are you doing?! --Hey, get away from there!

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.130
--Behave yourself! --Come on, stop squirming!

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.090
--It's no fair that only you guys are allowed. --Behave yourself! --Come on, stop squirming!

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.880
--It's no fair that only you guys are allowed. --Are you listening to me?! --Let's go!

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.970
--Let me play with the kids, too. --Are you listening to me?! --Let's go!

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:53.060
That was probably Kurono. I've heard stories about him.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:58.400
"Tephrosis" "Psycho" "Relishes the weak" "Reaper" "Bully" "Exotic black smoke" "Maddest"

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.600
Captain Shinmon of the 7th is well-known as being the "Mightiest,"

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.820
but this man Kurono is said to be the "Maddest" pyrokinetic.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.120
Here we are. Does it bring back any memories?

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.740
Huh? Was this the place?

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.620
Oh, they do change the locations of their labs periodically

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.370
to keep their information hidden.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.420
Which just goes to show how disgraceful what they're doing is.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.880
Let's go.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.760
Viktor Licht, chief researcher, applied pyrokinesiology lab.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.840
Right, we're expecting you.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.810
Have you noticed?

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.650
Well, yeah. Security is keeping a close eye on us.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.240
As if to say, "You're definitely not getting out of here."

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:53.990
Though I have to admit, I'm excited to get to observe such a shady facility.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.910
Are you sure you should be saying that in front of the security guard?

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.420
I'm going to get killed here anyway, so...

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.840
I won't let them kill you. I promise, I'll protect you.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.460
Inspector Licht, even if you are a Haijima spy,

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.510
you've still saved me time and again.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.840
You're someone we definitely need at the 8th.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:16.180
Wow, I'm pleased to hear it. I can die happy now.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.730
No you can't.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.560
Did you hear what he just said about me, Joker?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.150
I may just leave you for the 8th.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.240
I can't let Joker be the only one out there risking his neck.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.450
I wrote that ridiculous report to rankle the top brass

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.830
so I could get some dirt on Haijima.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:40.290
I'm going to exploit the good will of the 8th and Shinra-kun to that end

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.830
if it means getting my hands on the truth.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.880
We've been expecting you. Welcome to the pyrokinesis development lab.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.510
The kids will be thrilled to see you.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.010
How the hell can you say that, when you torture kids the way you do?

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.560
Yes, of course. You want to see the children right away, don't you?

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.310
Well, come on inside.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.570
--How cute! --Amazing!

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.280
--Hey, I want to try! --Me, too!

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.400
This is how we take care of children

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.700
who still do not know how to control their abilities.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.240
I requested that I be allowed to see the boy you took in

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.410
after the Rekka Hoshimiya incident,

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.040
but was told that I was not authorized.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.330
I'd like to see how he is. Is that possible?

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.210
Oh, you must mean Nataku-kun.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:31.470
He is a special case, so he is not at this facility.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.100
Help me!

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.350
Somebody!

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.260
An Adolla Link!

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.310
I want to go home!

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.850
Are you...?

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.820
Shinra-kun?

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.690
Yes, an Adolla Link.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:56.530
Like hell he isn't here. This is where that boy is.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.620
They really are hiding something.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.120
Let's play along with them for a bit and see what we can uncover.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.430
Crewman Kusakabe, thanks for your help with our Adolla Burst observations.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.310
This will be a simulated battle test, if you'd be so kind.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.110
This cold, empty room...

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:31.400
...makes me feel like I'm having chills right down to my soul.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.450
When I think of how they're treating me like a lab rat,

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.820
my humanity just melts away.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.660
Until nothing but my weird tic remains.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.710
I look forward to working with you today.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.420
Let's make this a fun experiment.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:01.600
I will never forget that look-- like he's staring down his prey.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.310
He really is here.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:09.100
I remember you. I used to catch glimpses of you around here.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.520
I wish I could have played with you back then.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.820
Now you've become a fine man.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.280
I wanted to devour you when you were still spindly and pasty.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.370
Why didn't they let me have at you when you were a child?

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.090
You're about the same height as me now, aren't you?

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:35.960
Although, you still seem plenty weak.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:46.270
You have a fully grown-up strength now. Why can't boys just stay weak?

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.730
Can I get started?

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.520
Yeah. Kusakabe-kun, you, too.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.780
I'm going to kick that bastard's ass.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:03.030
His tephrosis is severe. Should he really be spreading that much black smoke?

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.670
Right Hand Eclipse!

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.500
"Right Hand Eclipse"

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:21.390
What just happened? The fist he swung didn't even hit me.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:26.060
It wasn't that much of a right, either. Did anything touch me?

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.980
If I had to say... ...it was the black smoke.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.980
Whatever the case, I can't deal with it until I know what's causing it.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.320
I can't just keep taking those. But I do have my speed. I'll use my Rapid!

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.040
He reacted to that?!

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.540
No, let me go again!

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.800
How can he react to Shinra-kun's Rapid if this is the first time he's seeing it?

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.560
You're abusing the children here, aren't you?

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.310
There's no way I'll let you do that!

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.270
Shinra-kun, show us more of that Adolla Burst!

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:16.690
Shut up! I will! When I kick all of your asses on the other side of that glass!

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.320
Th-That's terrifying.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.200
What the hell is that black smoke?!

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.540
I'm not trying to hide it. And even once I tell you,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.620
there's still no way you can deal with it.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.880
This black smoke links with my senses,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.170
allowing me to sense minute fluctuations.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.380
That's how I reacted to your speed attacks.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:46.010
Also, knocking children around is fun. They get good air.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.180
Would you like to give it a try?

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.100
S-Screw you!

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.690
I'll hit him with so many chained attacks that he can't react!

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.860
His firepower is increasing with every spin.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.320
Good! Keep it up! Keep it up!

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.290
His smoke is solidifying!

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.690
Eclipse Veil!

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.150
"Eclipse Veil"

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.580
He gathered the smoke together to make weapons?

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.750
You still have some fight left, right?

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.460
Though it would be perfect if you broke down after that much.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.920
Kurono-kun, that's all for today! We've collected plenty of data!

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:11.010
--Hold on, what is he doing? --120... 130... Room temperature is rising.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:16.390
But then, the more I weaken you, the more I get into this.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.980
We'll keep going.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.940
I'm going to enjoy this.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.950
"To be continued"

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.460
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.580
"Next time"

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.960
The researchers rush into the chaotic test site.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.710
Something about Nataku-san has changed?

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.340
A strange lady stands in the way of the 8th,

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.430
and on top of all that, the White-Clad show up!

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.600
What's going to happen now?

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.560
Fire...!

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:28.480
"Episode 15: A Three-Way Melee"

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:23.520
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 15, "A Three-Way Melee."

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.200
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.
