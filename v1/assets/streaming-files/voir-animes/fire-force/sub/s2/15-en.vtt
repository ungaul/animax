00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:08.650
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.240
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.370
...is death by fire.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.290
"Testing Area"

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.290
Come to the special care room!

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.510
Something unusual is happening to Nataku Son!

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.600
I-It's hot! My right arm is hot!

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.520
Is that...?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.270
Fire...!

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.490
We're observing an Adolla Burst from Nataku Son in the special care room?

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.370
Nataku Son? So he really is here.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.990
This is a classified matter.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.200
It's not something to be discussed with outsiders.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.870
--Kurono-kun, the experiment is on hold!

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.460
--So the Sixth Pillar's Adolla Burst has awakened. --Kurono-kun, the experiment is on hold!

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.670
Then did Shinra-kun's Adolla Burst end up being the trigger?

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.470
Come in.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.800
Captain Obi, do you read me?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.850
The situation has taken a turn.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.770
Wha--?!

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.480
Shinra and Licht are in trouble! Hurry, Vulcan!

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.070
If anything happens to those two, you'll pay, Haijima!

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.610
This is war, you dumb bastards!

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.330
A Matchbox has broken through!

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.120
We're currently tracking down whose it is!

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.040
That was fast. I haven't even told them anything yet.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.470
"Episode 15: A Three-Way Melee"

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.720
What's going on in there?!

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.010
The temperature inside the room is continuing to rise.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.430
What are those two doing?!

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.430
We're still reading them, but there's been no change.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.270
I won't let them kill you. I promise, I'll protect you.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.820
Inspector Licht, even if you are a Haijima spy,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.940
you've still saved me time and again.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.110
You're someone we definitely need at the 8th.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.950
They don't hesitate to risk their lives for their friends.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.580
So this is what the 8th is.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.910
It's the strangest thing. Maybe I've been there too long,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.460
--The speakers are still connected, right? --but they seem to be rubbing off on me. I'll go along with this.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.590
--Yes, they should still be working. --but they seem to be rubbing off on me. I'll go along with this.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.590
All right...

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.920
Kurono-kun, the test is canceled! Head over to where Nataku-kun is!

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.010
"Open" "Testing Area"

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.850
--What are you doing?! --Shinra-kun,

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.980
there's no need to play along with the experiment anymore!

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.390
Let's get out of here!

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.020
Why, you!

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.940
I won't be outdone in a nerd fight!

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.280
Nab him!

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.740
Licht-san!

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.200
Nataku Son is here after all. It sounds like his Adolla Burst has awakened.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.290
I knew they were hiding something!

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.500
That cry for help through my Adolla Link was for real!

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.090
The 8th will safeguard Nataku!

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.890
What's all the commotion?

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.560
The 8th has broken in! You have to keep Nataku-kun from them!

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.360
The Fire Force, huh? There are probably some weaklings among them.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.660
I'm going to take on the weaker ones first.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.200
Where are Shinra and Licht?

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.620
Vulcan, eyes forward.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.580
It's just a little doll, isn't it?

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.380
I'll run right over it!

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.840
Spider Wire on!

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.350
Is everyone okay?

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.320
What's that now?!

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.030
Hostile object spotted. Countering with Tekkyo.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.790
Don't tell me that thing did all that!

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.080
What do you mean?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.460
That's what flipped the Matchbox over.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.960
How can it be so powerful at that size?

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.010
What the hell kind of generators are Haijima using?

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.590
Ah, wait! Look at where those cables lead!

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.640
Oh, my, what brings you here?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.900
I've been tasked with watching the children, since they're scared of Kurono,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.150
and now I get to teach the Fire Force some manners, too?

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.320
Do you know what this angel belt buckle means? It means I'm a nice lady.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.910
Maki-san, I'll back you up!

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.410
I'm not about to be bested by any Haijima mech!

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.880
Dominions, let's play with our bigger friends now!

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.090
Where is Nataku?!

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.840
They said he was in the special care room.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.550
Secure Nataku Son at once!

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.010
--Shinra-kun... --Right.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.100
Looks like he's that way!

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.350
Whoa...

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.900
You shouldn't do that to the nice security guards, you know.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.280
L-Let... Let me go!

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.820
You're too late.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.450
Sputter! Flare!

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.450
Boom!

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.040
They got deflected?!

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.880
One more time!

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.710
They got fired on?!

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.760
Hit them one more time with a Poot-Poot Blaster!

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.760
--Poot-Poot Blaster?! --Poot-Poot Blaster?!

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.100
"Pbbt"

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.310
How lowbrow. I definitely don't want to get hit by that.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.480
Oh, the children love that one.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.280
Don't you Fire Soldiers, the heroes of children, know that?

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.820
Dominions and I raced here to put smiles on the children's faces.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.160
Please don't spoil the children's day of fun.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.790
We know that you Haijima people mistreat the children!

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.960
"Day of fun" my ass! Screw that!

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.880
What's the name of that mech you made?

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.220
What?

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.890
I asked what their name is.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.060
The Twin Hover Units, Tekkyo!

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.930
The what? Too hard to follow.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.480
What? What are you talking about?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.560
That's too hard for the children to understand.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.820
Hmm, let's see...

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.570
If it were up to me, going by the way they look, I'd call them...

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.120
"Caterpillies."

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.870
That's adorable! I love it!

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.580
No way!

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.450
Why not?

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.500
You're the one who said they should have an animal name, weren't you?

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.790
Maki-san, you just don't get it!

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.750
Giving a mech the name of a living thing

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.010
helps to lend the inorganic mech a little more creature-istic...

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.590
...what do you call it? Affinity? That's the whole reason for the name!

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.510
But "Caterpillies" is out of the question! It doesn't have enough character!

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.100
I want them to have some affinity, but mech has to be mech!

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.850
The name has to have a certain detachment!

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:09.610
In that sense, the iron owl, "Tekkyo" is the perfect name! It's cool!

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.820
Wow, what an obnoxious otaku.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.280
--Mm-hmm. --Huh?!

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.160
Mech is about dreams! I don't expect you to understand right off!

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.120
Anyone who calls a mech "that dude" or "little guy" will never get it!

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.620
And anyone who gives a mech a girly name like "cutie-pie" is simply a sicko!

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.450
A big pervert!

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.290
Where's the harm? If you give a mech a cute name and treat it with love,

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.750
it's sure to respond in kind. If you build a relationship of trust,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.300
you'll find its performance to be even better.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.590
That's a ridiculous way of thinking, Haijima!

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.640
You make it sound religious and gross.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.510
Mech will always be mech! You can't build a relationship of trust with them.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.140
There's no telling when they will break down and disappoint you.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.650
That's why you can't neglect their maintenance.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.900
People can disappoint you pretty easily, too.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.820
Yeah, which is why trusting in others is so necessary.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.490
You've got this. We're going to head out and rescue Shinra.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.200
We at the 8th will never betray each other!

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.580
Now return our men to us!

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.540
You two don't seem to understand.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.290
I don't treat mech as if they were people.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:17.380
I'm saying that mech and people are the same. Children especially so!

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.840
What do you mean?!

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.010
If you amuse children, they're entertained,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.180
and if you try to annoy them, they get upset.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.390
Their actions are predictable. I make them do as I please.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.310
Mech and children are both the instruments of adults.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.070
She swatted them away like it was nothing.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.490
Maki-san,

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.450
that woman is probably a third generation pyrokinetic.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.330
I don't see any other reason

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.330
how she gets that much power out of such a tiny mech.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.750
As long as she has the upper hand in power,

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.630
there's no point in taking her on like this.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.470
But I can't let her get away with thinking of children as tools!

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.890
I've collected enough data on their Caterpillies.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:10.310
Their power is stable and their firepower is fairly constant.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.690
You're a second generation pyrokinetic who can control flames.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.860
That means the edge in firepower goes to my Dominions.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.700
Do you have any ideas here?

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.370
Let's put everything into a maximum-power shot with both Tekkyo!

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.790
I believe in you, Vulcan.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.620
Dominions and I have this in the bag.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.920
My goodness, there they go, running away.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.350
Tekkyo switching to Fire Scene Mode!

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.060
Charge superthermal power!

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.520
Jet throttle circuits online. Release of all ports complete!

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.980
Sanchin-style launch stance ready!

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.820
Twin unit coordinates locked! Engaging maximum output!

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.950
Maximum thrust in three... two... one...

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.830
Judging by this data and configuration,

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.870
I can pretty well guess their critical power.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.630
And sure enough, Dominions and I are still home free!

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.170
In all my time watching children, I've never once been surprised,

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.510
and you two are just like my children-- you're absolutely predictable.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.430
Dominions, get set with a Poot-Poot!

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.100
Critical power reached! Let's do this!

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.600
Tekkyo, maximum output!

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:41.400
90... 100... Better than I expected, but still not good enough.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.450
Violent-but-Deadly Poot-Poot Blaster!

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.160
That's it! Keep on coming, and get blown away!

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.590
Sputter! Flare! Hang in there!

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:14.310
Power output 100... 110... 120... It's still climbing?

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.230
150?!

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.310
Are you kidding me?!

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.230
It's not a mech you're facing; it's people!

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.610
I can't let Vulcan's mech lose.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.290
Where was that mech hiding that much power?

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.000
That was awesome, Maki-san!

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.130
Tekkyo, you did well, too!

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.840
If you had lost, you both would have been blown away.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.720
I can't believe you would fight so recklessly.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.050
Are you saying you figured on things turning out like this?

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.180
We didn't figure on anything. It was trust.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.020
Yeah, she's right. Going by the numbers, it was impossible.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.810
But I trusted that when Maki-san gets fired up,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.940
she can deliver performance beyond the numbers!

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.320
I also believed in your plan and the Tekkyo, Vulcan.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.660
Wow... I'm a little bit surprised.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.830
Let's catch up to the others.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.790
Right. Let's hurry.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:26.050
Just a second! Playtime isn't over yet!

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.970
What makes you think you've beat me?

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.890
You're kidding, right?

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.480
We had that much trouble with just one of them!

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.270
Why did you think it was just one?

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.240
I told you, their name is Dominions, right?

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.870
Licht, where are you?

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.960
Licht, come in!

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.130
We're in the special care room.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.720
Currently engaging Haijima staff in combat.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.550
What does the building look like?

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:15.100
I'm sorry, but the thing is... ...visibility is poor...

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.720
Visibility is poor?

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.730
Northwest from the...

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.100
...gate...

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.980
Shinra! Licht!

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.650
Black smoke?

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.610
Licht-san, keep back!

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:35.620
Out of my way. Let me at the weak-looking guy behind you.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.040
Captain!

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.710
Licht-san, go join the captain.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.550
Shinra, Licht, are you both okay?

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:55.220
Captain, we found Nataku, but he's being safeguarded by Haijima staff.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.930
So you're crewmen from the 8th?

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.310
Let me go! I haven't done anything!

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:10.570
Not doing anything won't cut it! Unless you get fired up, it won't... cut... it!

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.780
You've got this! I know you do!

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.660
Your child abuse is clear to see! Let the boy go!

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.580
Abuse, maybe, but it's my job.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.460
Iris, keep back!

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:31.630
So the Fire Force has weaklings like that in their ranks?

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.050
--What was that?! --Iris, don't inhale it!

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.810
Captain Guard!

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.770
Trying to protect the weak is a waste of time.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.190
Don't you have any shame?!

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:54.280
"Spare the strong and quash the weak." "Let the world be as such."

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.240
That is my thinking.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.120
Everyone is right here.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.830
Just as I predicted, Sixth Pillar located!

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.670
There he is.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.420
Which one's the Sixth Pillar?

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.590
Charon, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be with Haumea?

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.680
I really am supposed to be, actually.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.640
Pillars and their protectors are a set.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:24.180
But Haumea got too annoyed at me, and told me to get lost.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.230
Yeah, I get that. I went through a period like that with my father.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.980
Come to think of it, he died during that period.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:37.200
Do all girls your age go through this sort of thing? Well, shoot.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.700
That doesn't mean you had to come with me, though.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.040
You could have just been quiet and stood by.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.290
Inca, are you treating me like a pest, too?

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.460
Yes she is, Charon-san.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.670
I am here to keep Miss Inca safe.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.260
Me, her protector maid.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.890
We're both protectors here, so let's just get along and guard the Pillar, Ritsu.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.100
Silence, Char-oaf. Only my master gives me orders.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.310
Ch-Char-oaf?!

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:09.610
Fine. Ritsu, you take Inca. Which one is the next Pillar?

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.650
The kid being carried in that guy's arm.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.240
Things are about to get fun again.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.070
Let's recover him.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.410
Stop treating him so rough!

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:29.920
I'm warning you--you stronger ones, leave the weak here and go!

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.340
Not you!

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.090
The Sixth Pillar is ours!

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.260
No reaction?

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.310
CLAP!

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.980
--Grab the Sixth Pillar! --Right!

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.060
Wah! L-Let go of me!

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.940
H-Help!

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.110
The White-Clad, here?

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.950
And a body that blades can't hurt?

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.780
What exactly is going on here?

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.740
There you are again, Charon!

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.200
We meet again, fire-rat. I'm here for the Sixth Pillar.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.080
How did you know there would be an Adolla Burst here?!

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.130
Don't tell me it was Inca!

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.090
Hello!
You!

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.590
Let's watch a whole bunch of people die again together!

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.590
It's dangerous to stand that far forward.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.300
Ritsu, you worry too much.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.560
It doesn't do any good to worry over such little things.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:39.360
There, you see? There's danger all over the place.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.870
How are we supposed to take on this many of them?

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.490
All we can really do now is run.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:53.420
Oh, don't be like that. Let's enjoy this puppet show together.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.590
Wow!

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.380
Ah! Look what you did to my Dominions!

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.140
Haijima-made stuff sure is fragile, huh?

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.600
If I could have sniped them from a distance,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.730
we wouldn't have had to expose you to danger by coming so close.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.400
Today, you're protecting me instead of our precious Sho-kun,

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.730
Arrow.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.440
White-Clad?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.690
That electricity-user is bad news.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.950
We need to get Arthur, or it will get ugly for us.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.200
Well, shucks. She destroyed them like it was child's play.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.410
And in the middle of a children's play, too.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:36.500
We've come for Nataku, the Sixth Pillar. We won't let anyone stand in our way.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.210
That's why I took those things out ahead of time.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.680
It's a very big no-no to break other people's things.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.090
You're a naughty little girl.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.140
O-ho, I think the old biddy is about to snap.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.270
Arrow, you say something to zing her, too.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.690
I'll handle things here. Vulcan, you go get Arthur.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.320
I'll leave the Tekkyo here.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.940
It's going to take a little more time to cool down before they can restart.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.870
It looks like playtime is at an end.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.960
This calls for some painful discipline.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.630
Come on, punisher Dominion!

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.730
It's stretched out all over!

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.370
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.370
"Next time"

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.880
As the battle between the 8th, Haijima, and the White-Clad unfolds,

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.800
Ritsu's ability places Nataku-san in a dire situation.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.380
Isn't this a little bit too dangerous?

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.390
Time for a new job.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:23.350
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 16, "Mind Blown."

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:28.530
"Episode 16: Mind Blown"

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:28.020
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.
