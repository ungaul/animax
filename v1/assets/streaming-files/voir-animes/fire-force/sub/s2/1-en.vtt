00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.626
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.240
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.250
...is death by fire.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.736
"Episode 1: A Fire Soldier's Fight"

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.770
"Ameyoko"

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.300
Where should we go next?

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.360
I think they sell ice cream over there.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.756
It looked really good.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.990
Ice cream, ice cream!

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.200
Isn't this nice? The two of them look so cute and girly.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.596
Maki-san, you could have worn a dress, too. You'd look good in one.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.660
I...

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.670
...can't pull it off.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.610
It's like the fight in the Nether never happened.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.100
There are so many people here, living in fear that they might become an Infernal.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.860
I have to make sure those joyful smiles aren't just a sham...

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.936
...by finding a way to turn Infernals back into people.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.146
Then I'll unravel the mystery of the Evangelist and Adolla Bursts,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.936
and do away with spontaneous human combustion.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.930
What's wrong? You've got a goofy look on your face.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.656
You're eating more? I'm surprised you can put away all that sweet stuff.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.910
Hey, guys, I have a little suggestion.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.310
"Operation Make Over the Lieutenant."

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.586
This is my first day off in a while.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.360
Come to think of it, I haven't played any soccer recently.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.296
Would you like to go to that place I mentioned before?

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.596
Oh, I would!

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.556
Let's go check out some new clothes.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.136
I want to have some freshly-made ice cream!

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.436
I'm looking forward to us all going out together.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.370
They're all going shopping?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.476
It's been a long day, huh?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.630
The three of us are going out tomorrow.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.840
Shinra-san, how would you like to come with us?

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.276
Me, too? Are you sure you don't mind?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.616
Sister, why invite him?

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.116
Do you have any plans?

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.270
Oh, no, nothing in particular.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.626
...Good evening, sir! ...Good evening, sir!

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.666
Good evening, sir!

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.916
"Waypoint"

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.626
You're all going shopping?

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.416
"Don't Cry Bypass"

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.440
That sounds nice.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.050
Go enjoy yourselves.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.570
...Yes, sir...Yes, sir.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.716
His fashion sense is as awful as ever.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.556
Does he get pushed into buying the shopping district's overstock?

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.230
The lieutenant is the one who should be going shopping.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.836
What if we were to buy some more stylish clothes for the lieutenant?

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.816
Oh, that sounds like fun!

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.526
...Good idea! Which store should we go to?

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.646
...Lieutenant... ...Good idea! Which store should we go to?

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.320
...they're having fun at your expense.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.036
Oh, my... What do you think about this one?

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.196
No, this one!

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.390
Well, how about this?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.576
Do you think he'd actually wear something like this?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.246
A bald wig? I doubt even he would do that.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.756
It has to at least fit in the hat category for the lieutenant to even consider it.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.200
Well then, how about this one?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.716
Oh, is that what we're up to now?

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.290
I think a stuffed-animal head might be pushing it a bit, too.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.146
"Head Spa"

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.016
"Don't Cry Bypass"

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.646
Indeed, I'm curious where the lieutenant draws the line on his fashion sense.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.066
It makes me want to push right up to where that line is!

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.406
I love our lieutenant.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.246
Hold on, I thought we were trying to make the lieutenant look better.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.366
And if our goal is to make him look snappier,

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.650
what are we even doing in this store?

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.296
Maki-san is the one who picked the store.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.820
Shinra-san, this would look good on you.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.860
Oh, she's so close...

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.120
Ah, this is fun.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.976
You're so damn gross.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.776
...Who are you calling gross? ...You are. Stay away from me.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.196
She's so aggravating.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.696
Tamaki-san has been very concerned about you.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.036
We heard about your mother. Let's all work together to find a way to save her.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.036
You got hurt so badly, and yet you pulled through.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.480
I'm sure you'll see Sho-kun again.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.820
Thank you very much.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.280
I really am glad... we're all at the 8th.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.870
Thank you!

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.686
Maki-san!

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.646
I'm taking provisional command as an emergency response.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.396
Shinra, get over to the site fast and assess the situation,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.396
and direct the civilian evacuation there.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.856
You two are with me.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.906
We're going to secure evacuation routes for the civilians in the area.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.260
...Roger! ...Roger!

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.040
Ow...

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.960
Excalibur!

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.720
Arthur?!

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.536
It is a knight's duty to protect the weak, Devil.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.230
Who are you calling weak, you stupid knight?!

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.266
Are you all right, Shinra?!

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.460
Yes, sir!

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.786
Is that an Infernal?

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.576
Look how big it is.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.376
What do we do, Captain?

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.336
The civilian evacuation is complete, right? Let's get this sorted out.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.126
Shinra, get into your turnout gear.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.296
Roger!

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.886
Licht and Vulcan, locate the core of that giant Infernal.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.716
...Roger that...You got it.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.556
Sister, if you'll handle the prayer?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.386
Right.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.136
The rest of us will buy time until their analysis is complete.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.500

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.396
Is this even possible?

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.510
This is intriguing!

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.720
Not good, not good, not good!

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.210

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.376
What did your analysis reveal?

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.166
We discovered something fascinating. This thing's body has multiple cores.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.296
Multiple cores?

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.386
Five, to be precise. One in each of his arms and legs,

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.516
and a main core, the toughest of them all, in his chest.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.936
You're saying we have to destroy all the cores to put this thing to rest?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.776
Yes indeed. To do so, all of you must destroy the arms and legs,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.736
to immobilize the giant Infernal.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.986
As for the final, hardened main core,

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.276
Shinra-kun will have to hit it with his maximum firepower.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.446
All right, those of you with ranged attacks... Hinawa, Maki, and Tamaki... take the arms;

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.746
Arthur and I will take out the legs.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.956
Beyond that, Shinra, it all rests with you.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.876
Yes, sir!

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.256
We can't afford to waste any time. We'll tackle this all at once!

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.426
1420. Commencing putting this giant Infernal to rest!

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.950
...Roger! ...Roger!

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.040

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.680

Ashes thou wert and art. May thy soul...

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.036

"Nudist Bitch"

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.486
I am terribly sorry, sir.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.656
Is there anyone who would come to work dressed like that, for any reason?!

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.786
I'm sorry, sir. I did not realize it until you said so.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.166
What the hell is the matter with you?!

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.756
What happened to make the captain so angry?

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.796
And with Lieutenant Hinawa, at that.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.966
What do we do? He's steaming mad because of what we did.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.056
W-We never thought he would actually wear it, though.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.636
Oh, God.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.726
Have you even read what's written on your cap?

"Nudist Bitch"

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.106
No, sir, I never even looked at it.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.226
Where did you even get such ridiculous clothes? Did you buy them yourself?

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.896
Ah, what do we do, what do we do?

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.856
...What do we do? ...We have to apologize.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.326
Yes, sir. I bought them myself.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.076
Lieutenant, that's going above and beyond.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.720
You did, huh? I see.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.536
Maki! Iris! Tamaki! Shinra! Get in here!

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.810
Eep. He knows.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.376
I know you gave him these clothes.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.586
You took advantage of the lieutenant's indifference to fashion.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.596
Is that what you think of your superior officers?

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.120
Who was it that planned this ridiculous stunt?!

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:25.106
The three of them were kind enough to invite me to go shopping with them.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.726
They're my dear friends here at the 8th.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.196
I have to be like Lieutenant Hinawa, and not sell my friends out.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.736
...Shinra did it! ...Shinra did it!

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.930
Huh?!

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:42.140
Mom... ...girls can be... ...terrifying.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.730
"Episode 1: A F̶i̶r̶e̶ ̶S̶o̶l̶d̶i̶e̶r̶'̶s̶ Man's Fight"

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.466
Shinra, come in here for a minute!

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.160
Excuse me, sir.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.306
The time has come once again. This year, we're going to do this right.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.926
Huh? Do what?

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:05.016
The Special Fire Force nude calendar!

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.096
"Nude?"

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.710
Huh?!

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.750
"Overindulgent pecs"

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.276
Th-The Special Fire Force nude calendar, sir?

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.616
"Powerful abs"

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.076
The nude calendar!

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.486
"Brawny backs"

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.826
"Expository biceps"

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:24.666
It's something they started to make the Special Fire Force more relatable.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.086
And the shoot for this calendar is coming up?

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:31.626
Currently, there are eight Special Fire Force companies.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.466
Each company takes their month in turn between January and August.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.506
Our month is August.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.926
What do they do with September through December?

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.386
From September on, it goes by popularity.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.766
The best four start in September,

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.516
and work their way up to first place in December.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.500
What place did the 8th take last year?

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:56.816
Last place, sir?

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.816
Correct.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.656
I'm just going to have a look...

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.230
...at last year's calendar. Let's see, August...

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.706
You really went all out, I see.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.480
We were aiming for the top spot.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.926
By the way, who was in first place? They would be December, right?

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.910
That company boasts steadfast popularity.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.436
Ugh, Rekka...

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.016
As a result of the crowd-favorite Rekka being killed in action,

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.106
we may stand a chance this year.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.606
Indeed, that's true.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.066
That's inappropriate to say! And how is he a crowd favorite?

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.866
Come to think of it, there's Dr. Giovanni from the 3rd.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.890
They might show what he's got under wraps.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.116
This has definitely been faked, huh?

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.376
Damn you, die!

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.030
Nude, though, huh? Nude...

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:04.330
What did the 5th do? I might get to see Captain Hibana's dynamite nu... nude...

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.976
Who are these guys?! Screw them! They're the gravel guys, aren't they?!

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.960
Shinra-san, what were you hoping to see? The calendar is just men.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.726
"Special Fire Force Company 5, Combine"

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.816
Shinra naked! I want to see Shinra's calendar picture!

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.300
"Interior, Captain's Office"

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:26.446
I want to... I want to, but on the other hand...

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.706
...everyone will see!

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.456
The whole world will realize what appeal Shinra has...

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.626
Once that happens, Shinra will no longer belong to only me.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:41.006
But that's inevitable. I have no choice but to accept it.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.756
...Princess, would you please check our photo?

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.300
...Shut up, gravel! Just go with whatever! ...Princess, would you please check our photo?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.726
They're all getting into this more than I expected.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.896
I'll bet the 7th has absolutely no interest in this.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.476
Captain Shinmon is actually pretty popular.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:01.106
Huh?! Captain Shinmon?! I can understand why he'd be popular,

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.616
but how would he even appear in this to begin with?

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.390
July...

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.770
This was definitely from a hidden camera, wasn't it?

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.666
Hey, where is Waka?

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:19.586
He went to the bathhouse, sir. Is it time for this year's calendar again?

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:24.846
We can't let ourselves be outdone by those empire dirtbags at anything.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.096
I'm going to go snap a great photo of him with this.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.136
I'm looking forward to seeing it, Lieutenant Konro.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.330
Hey!

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.726
You really got me good last year.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.976
Did you really think I wouldn't notice?!

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.196
They're all waiting... for the big, bold man who can win over everyone.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.680
There's only one such man here in Asakusa.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.036
You have to do this, Benimaru!

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.520
Me...?

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.586
...Stop screwing around! Give me that camera! I'll take it!

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.716
...No, Waka! It has to be you! As a man, you get it, right?! ...Stop screwing around! Give me that camera! I'll take it!

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.796
A hidden camera shot, a doctored photo, and the gravel brigade...

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.950
How did the 8th get beaten out by all of them?

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.516
That all ends this year.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:17.516
This year, we have new personnel! The 8th's calendar days are just beginning!

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.146
...Hmph! ...We'll get 'em this year!

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:23.896
That's true; last year, it was just Captain Obi and Lieutenant Hinawa.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.076
Compared to the other companies, that seems a little vacant.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.406
I have to ask, though, what's up with this pose you're both doing?

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.430
That pose is...

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.376
Power!

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.730
Cobra!

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.626
Huh?

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.176
How about that? It's well received by the female half.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.886
No, no, no, look at how they're taking it!

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.386
You can't let the whole world in on an inside joke like that!

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.176
What's wrong, Shinra? There's no spark in your eye.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.266
Well, no, of course not.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.556
I've come up with the way we're going to win this year.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.856
You've come up with some other weird gimmick?

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:06.300
The star of this secret plan will be front and center. Take a good look.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.116
Power!

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.470
Cobra!

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.060
Wait for it!

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.270
...Twin Cobras! ...Twin Cobras!

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.230
Dead last.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.476
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.370
"Next time"

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.436
Shinra-san calls on Captain Hague of the 4th

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.226
in search of information concerning Adolla Bursts.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.186
As Shina is taken aback by Captain Hague's odd demeanor,

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.356
something strange comes over him, as well!

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.236
What's happened to you, Shinra-san?

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.986
I'm done with this. Die, every last one of you!

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:17.156
"Episode 2: Flames of Madness"

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.916
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 2, "Flames of Madness."

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.706
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.730
