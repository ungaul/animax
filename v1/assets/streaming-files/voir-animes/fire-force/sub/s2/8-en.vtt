WEBVTT

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.350
Protect the forest.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.166
Shinra-kun, are you okay?

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.086
Judging by your behavior, has it happened again?

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.966
Yes. There was a voice.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.490
Protect the forest.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.136
It said, "Protect the forest."

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.056
A voice? So it really is an Adolla Link?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.816
Does the voice belong to the leader of the bandits?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.526
Well, I don't know exactly what it is.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.696
I heard it coming from the direction of the Tabernacle, though.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.300
Don't tell me... ...it was coming from in there...

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.336
Everything I've had, I've lost,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.636
but I won't let go of this remaining spark

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.226
No, I won't let it go, not ever

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.816
Though there may be no right answers in my ill-defined tale,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.986
once I'm able to step forward...

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.656
They say something's wrong with me, but I'll do something with them

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.616
I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.246
But if my dreams have resolved themselves to be by your side

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.296
then there's nothing left for me to doubt anymore

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.136
Sparks fly as things kick off

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.966
until "black and white" turns to ashen gray

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.886
If there's a choice crown to be had

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.766
I want it, I want it I'll whizz my way toward you

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.686
until "double or nothing" gets zeroed out

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.486
If the clowns are melancholy

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.316
then nothing will get anywhere

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.656
I'll show you a love that burns hot enough to scorch ashes

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.310
I just spark again

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.480
"Episode 8: Smoldering Malevolence"

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.836
If you heard it coming from the Tabernacle,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.756
does that mean that it uses an Adolla Burst, too?

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.926
Then again, the Tabernacle is an inorganic object.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.686
Can it even perform a Link?

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.396
There, you see?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.146
Those guys attack us unprovoked. There's no talking to them!

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.566
Scop...

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.156
...tell me more about the Tabernacle. How long has it been there?

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.486
The Tabernacle is something that was here before us,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.786
which our benefactor fixed.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.076
Benefactor?

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.796
It was shortly after the Great Cataclysm devastated the world 250 years ago.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.780
One day, a lone traveler appeared.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.976
It was a human woman, wrapped in a robe of pitch black.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.066
This woman preached to us animals,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.946
who were just waiting for death in this wasteland, and taught us how to speak.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.446
Why have you come here, lady?

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.310
I came from beyond the spatial rift to once again recreate this world.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.466
Now, you must be hungry, right?

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.780
Warm yourselves with this flame.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.596
The flame that she produced was very warm,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.556
and we soon noticed that our hunger was gone,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.960
and our lives had been extended.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.050
But then, one day...

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.836
...she repaired the abandoned Tabernacle,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.240
and then disappeared.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.556
It is because of the Tabernacle that this Oasis came about,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.646
and we are still alive.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.806
Yeah.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.436
She is our benefactor. She may come back here someday.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.946
Until that time, we will keep the Tabernacle safe.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.326
Where did this woman go?

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.826
No one has seen her since that day.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.940
Still, we cannot turn over to them the place where she will return!

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.206
Protect the forest.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.176
The voice probably belongs to her.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.966
Yeah, it is possible.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.306
It's safe to say that the spot we singled out to investigate is the Tabernacle.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.540
What on earth is the story there?

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.476
It's them!

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.566
A person?

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.460
A former person.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.800
There are Infernals here, too?!

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.946
...Licht-san! ...Help me! ...It's a trap!

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.866
Shinra, go help Inspector Licht!

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.980
Yes, sir!

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.440
Licht-san!

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.900
He's dead!

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.006
Licht-san!

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.056
Oof... Are you all right?

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.596
Huh? I thought I was dead.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.016
Thank goodness! Lieutenant Pan's defensive buff was in time.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.976
I don't even have a scratch.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.800
That's incredible.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.180
...He has friends. ...This time we're dead for sure!

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.706
Shinra, take Licht-san and get him back!

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.536
R-Right.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.610
...The prayer! ...Yeah!

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.756
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.176
The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.820
Yoruba Spears!

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.120
Excalibur!

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.686
Látom.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.790
Stay away! I don't taste good!

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.906
Damn, there are quite a few of them, huh?

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.996
Grr... How dare you defile our friends and the Oasis!

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.520
Give us back our Oasis!

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.150
Give us back the Tabernacle!

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.200
You guys okay?

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:20.766
Hu... mans... Who... are you...?

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.346
They can talk?!

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.840
Well, if moles can talk, why not?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.566
Don't you even see us animals here?

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.986
Hey! You can hear me, right?!

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.640
We've seen an Infernal that can talk once before...

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.336
Why won't you look at me?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.296
Stop... ignoring us animals!

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.990
Get them.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.276
You guys need the creative energy of the Tabernacle?

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.560
If so, won't you consider living in harmony with the animals?

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.866
You say...

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:29.086
...that has the power of creation? Don't be ridiculous.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:35.740
That was built... in order to destroy the world.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.396
It is there... to destroy.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.396
...Destroy... Destroy... Destroy...

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.566
...The Tabernacle is a weapon built to destroy the world? ...Destroy... Destroy... Destroy...

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.156
But Amaterasu in Tokyo isn't, right?

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.656
No, it actually does make some sense.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.076
Dr. Giovani went to Vulcan's workshop to find the key to Amaterasu.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.546
The objective of Dr. Giovani and the rest of the Evangelist's men

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.796
is to once again trigger a Great Cataclysm.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.006
I'm not sure what it is they're after,

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.506
but they're out to destroy the world again.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.306
And in order to achieve that goal, they'll need Amaterasu, right?

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.096
Then it's true that it really is a weapon of destruction?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.856
No!

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.606
The Tabernacle that that woman created is no such thing!

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:38.156
Just look at this forest! This is all because of the Tabernacle!

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.446
Sure, she may have had a creepy face.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.496
She would smile this eerie, devilish smile.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.786
But when we were doomed to perish, she gave us language and life.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.206
She gave us the Oasis.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:58.796
Yeah, the voice I heard over the Adolla Link didn't sound like an evil one.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.490
I believe what Scop is telling us.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.096
Shinra...!

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.936
We are not going to let these guys...

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.670
...use the Tabernacle as a weapon of destruction!

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.316
The remaining tablets.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.340
You have gathered them all?

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.906
Now we can initialize the weapon of destruction.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.536
Good! The day of our souls' release draws near!

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.456
Let us face the time of our end together!

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.586
At last, we will be freed from the suffering of these flames.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.426
Ah, Tempe-sama!

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.676
Tempe-sama!

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.296
We have human intruders!

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.306
What did you say? Humans, all the way out here?

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:50.556
All of you, the time has come for you to do one last labor for me!

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.066
We will not allow anyone to interfere.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.396
I will only grant unto those who served me in this life

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:03.276
repose and glory in the world after death!

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.656
Labor, labor, labor, labor, kill those who stand in our way,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.956
and demonstrate your devotion to me.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.376
Labor for me, kneel down before me, and bow down your heads to me!

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.086
That is the path to salvation!

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.846
The only means of being released from these burning bodies!

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.490
...For thee! ...For thee!

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.226
...return to the great flame of fire.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.500
Látom.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.446
Let's take a moment to sort out our situation.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.316
According to our investigation so far,

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.696
they appear to want to use the Tabernacle to destroy the world.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.946
But, since they haven't actually executed their plan,

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:53.286
it's possible that there is something else that they require.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:58.206
Scop, is there anything else you can tell us? Anything might help.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.086
Hmm... Let's see...

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.886
Come to think of it, I saw them collecting those stone tablets.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.806
Oh, I saw that, too.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.846
Stone tablets?

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.016
They have gathered a number of them, huh?

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.516
They probably have quite a few of them by now.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.776
Are these tablets some sort of key that will activate the Tabernacle's power?

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.146
Who knows? But I can tell you for sure

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.566
that the Infernals' leader instructed them to collect the tablets.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.906
The guy has terrifying horns growing out of his head like this.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:29.866
Huh?!

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.706
...He has horns? ...There's a demon Infernal here?

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:33.576
Demon?

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.786
If there's a demon here, that changes things an awful lot.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.246
"Translation: Hmm..."

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.376
What, are they that bad?

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.166
I read the reports.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.216
It takes a ridiculous amount of firepower to put one to rest, right?

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.450
It's impossible for us to put one to rest with our numbers.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.516
I guess all we can do now is turn back.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.750
If there's a demon here, it will be impossible to take control here.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.736
However, we can't ignore the fact that they're trying to trigger a Cataclysm

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.446
by blowing up the Tabernacle.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.616
Licht-san, do you have any ideas about how to defeat this demon?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.786
Hmm, last time, it was a miracle that we got enough personnel together

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.060
and all worked together to finally put that one to rest.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.506
In any event, it would take enough firepower to blow this whole forest away.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.546
What?! Nothing doing!

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.096
Just a minute. I thought we were here to survey the Tabernacle, right?

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.266
Why are we talking about putting this demon to rest?

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.176
But we have to put a stop to their plans!

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.516
Besides, even if we can't put him to rest, we can at least slow him down.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.380
We'll keep the demon occupied, and the rest of you can survey the Tabernacle.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.010
Disrupting things is my strong point.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.326
I'll lay out the mission.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.446
A team will go inside the Tabernacle,

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:58.036
while Shinra and Ogun use their mobility to divert the demon's attention.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.996
Arthur, Tamaki, Juggernaut, you'll stand guard.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.126
...Yes, sir...Yes, sir.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.216
Meanwhile, Inspector Licht and I will investigate the Tabernacle.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.886
You're sure you can't drive them off?

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.386
We've already come this far.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.056
We'll put a stop to the Infernals' plans.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.420
But we can't defeat the demon. Defeating the demon is too hard.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.106
Don't worry, Scop.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.026
I'll take back the Oasis for you.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.946
Shinra...

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:31.970
I'll also defeat that demon for you. I'm a hero, after all!

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.140
A hero!

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.030
There's the entrance to the Tabernacle.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.676
There's nobody around.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.410
All right, we're going in now, while we can.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.316
Well?

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:16.036
We had a quick look around, but there's no sign of the demon or other Infernals.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.456
Things were quiet all the way into the inner chambers.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.166
They were? That works just fine for me. Change of plans.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:28.046
Shinra, Ogun, Tamaki, and Juggernaut, you stand guard outside.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.296
Arthur, you're with us, just in case anything happens in here.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.756
...Roger...Roger.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.660
All right, split up.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.176
...Shh! ...Shh!

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.266
Idiot!

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.170
Sorry, force of habit.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.856
The state of things inside is incredibly good.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.696
You wouldn't think this place was 250 years old.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.020
Of course, dummy. We've been keeping it clean this whole time.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.786
These must be the tablets you mentioned.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.650
What are these numbers?

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.120
It's a trap?!

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.290
Hey...

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.736
They're behind us, too.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.760
We're surrounded.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:40.036
You fell for it. You must be the humans who are intruding.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:45.746
These Infernals set a trap for us? Do they really have that much intelligence?

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.150
Shinra, over there!

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.716
...Horns...A demon.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.006
Wh-Wh-What do we do? We have to run!

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.386
The lieutenant and the others are still inside! You want to leave them there?!

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.306
You are barbarians, violating our sacred ground.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.766
The only thing we can do is buy some time.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.266
We can't let them inside, no matter what!

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.880
Kill those who stand in our way!

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.550
Why are they all coming after me?!

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:25.366
This is our sacred ground! We will not allow all of you to violate it!

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.850
Violate?

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.296
This place was the animals' Oasis!

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.756
You don't get to say anything when you encroached on this place first!

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.426
Couldn't you have coexisted?!

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.136
Coexist?

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.386
What you call the Tabernacle is a weapon of destruction!

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.516
There is no point in re-growing this forest!

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.050
I will burn all of it down!

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.366
Why are you trying to destroy everything?!

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.140
So that I can go to Heaven!

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.796
Ah! Don't ruin the forest!

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.506
Sorry!

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.166
So you can go to Heaven?

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.296
What do you mean by that?

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.716
For the 250 years since the Great Cataclysm,

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.466
I have wandered, unable to die.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.556
I want to die!

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:31.146
I need the firepower it would take to blow up the Tabernacle for me to die.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.526
And with a being such as myself dying,

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.396
I will require those in Heaven who will look after my needs.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.736
Now, the aftershock from the explosion may also blow away your seaport,

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.696
but I will let those who live there serve me in the afterlife as well.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.246
Oh, Tempe-sama!

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.666
We will follow you anywhere!

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.166
Will you join me in going to the afterlife?

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.876
I can have you serve me in some position or other in the afterlife.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.716
Tempe-sama, all I can do is grow potatoes.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.846
You want to serve him?!

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.926
You're trying to drag all of this down with you just so you can die?

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.646
Screw you, man! You go ahead and die on your own!

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.226
No, it's no easy matter for him to die.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.356
Huh?

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.686
He's right. It's going to take at least as much firepower to kill a demon

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.356
as it would take to blow up this whole forest.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.826
Oh, no... So you're saying we have to lose the forest?

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.866
What do we do with a demon that we can't put to rest?

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.206
There's nothing else we can do with him!

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.900
We have no choice but to fight!

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.940
What do you think you are doing?

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.216
Tempe's Holy Light!

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.926
For thee!

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:51.370
This is the blessing of light granted to those who perish with me!

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.566
Shinra!

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.276
That demon is too much for us to defeat on our own!

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.116
All we can do is buy time, like we planned!

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.246
Just buying time isn't good enough! If we don't stop him here,

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.076
he's gonna use the Tabernacle and we'll all wind up dead!

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.746
The town will be blown up, too!

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.376
Yeah! The potato fields will be turned into hot potatoes!

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.836
There are bigger things to worry about than potatoes!

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.466
Yes, but still...

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.006
Survey the Tabernacle, and put this demon to rest.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.676
Those are the only things that we have to do.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.306
Guys, let's pour all of the firepower we have right now into this guy!

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.620
...Yeah...You got it!

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.186
If you oppose me, your status in Heaven will drop down.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.146
Who cares?!

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.526
Still...

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.526
...how are we going to put him to rest with the people we have on hand?

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:48.236
What can we do to produce Captain Shinmon levels of firepower?

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:52.206
The Adolla Link. If I can gain the Evangelist's Grace,

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.076
that might be enough to put this demon to rest.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.456
No, the Evangelist is our enemy.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.626
Besides, there's no way I can get any Grace out here in this frontier land.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:05.756
Moreover, Lieutenant Pan and the others might be returning at any minute.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.120
Once they do, I can get a power-up buff...

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.790
What is it, Kusakabe?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.880
Was that... an Adolla Link?

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.026
What do we do?

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.566
My Excalibur can get us out of here in no time.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.236
We're letting Shinra-kun and the others handle things outside.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.246
We should continue our investigation.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.496
You're right.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.706
I have to say, I'm not sure what exactly these number sequences represent.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.086
They keep going on that way.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.796
Could it be some kind of code?

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:48.176
No. If it were a code, there would be some degree of regularity to them.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.596
But from what I can see, this number sequence is all but irregular.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:56.266
Caw! We've seen these before, too. They don't mean anything, do they?

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.686
Even if they don't mean anything to us,

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.936
it's safe to say that they meant something to whoever made these.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.146
There are numbers up there, too.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.656
They're all over the place.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.656
Random number sequences.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.286
...It will be quite a chore figuring out what these are. ..."Yoshiro, eat some meat" [44929917].

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.430
"Hurry and give me a banana" [87788990].

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.576
"Snacks by twos and ones" [34102515].

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.690
This is pi, right?

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.256
"To be continued"

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.570
...Huh? ...Huh?

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.436
Most incidences have their own name

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.316
But no one knows and I'm upside down

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.106
Billions of people exist

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.786
But not anybody tells me what that is

00:22:52.810 --> 00:23:00.456
Sacrificing my limited life Am I moving forward or not

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:07.586
I just want to believe Nothing goes to waste

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.966
I question myself Why I can't be who I want to be

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:17.596
tangled and translucent It drains me

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.936
Pretending and overextending myself

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.316
Wish one day I could love pathetic myself

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.366
Hoping for a dazzling future to come

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.986
Don't over decorate smile clumsily

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:42.416
Just live life the way I am This world is cruel

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.626
Can't choose how to be born

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:50.506
Stick up the middle finger then

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:55.370
Let's shoot off to the other side

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.436
"Fire Force, Season 2"

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.500
"Next time"

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.606
Arthur-san and the others inside the Tabernacle

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.936
arrive at last at the central core.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.396
There, they hear an eerie pulse echoing.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.260
This sound is a little bit scary.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.866
Is there something alive inside?

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:22.456
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 9, "The Core." "Episode 9: The Core"

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.336
Return to the great flame of fire. Látom.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.360
