00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.586
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.490
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.030
...is death by fire.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.276
Whoa, wicked! We can see it now!

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.276
Awesome!

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.526
Wow!

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.486
So that land is Avalon, is it?

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.826
It's more like the empire than I thought. Pretty idyllic, isn't it?

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.470
This brings back memories.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.716
Oh yeah! I'm first!

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.046
...Yeah! We reached the new continent! ...Yeah! We reached the new continent!

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.716
We're still on the dock; we haven't reached the home soil yet!

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.676
...Find some home soil! ...Find some home soil!

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.476
...Oh! ...It's soil!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.936
Whoa, this is the soil of another nation! Eat it, eat it!

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.936
Mm, yum.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.646
Bleah! No it isn't! We can't eat this!

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.776
You guys are too hyped up.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.356
Lieutenant Pan...

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.566
Yeah, this reminds me of the training academy.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.696
What kind of training academy?!

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.680
"Knight King was here"

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.366
I'm going to the post to draw supplies.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.076
I know we don't often get to go out of the empire, but there's no time to waste.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.246
I'll show you the way.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.456
Takeru!

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.376
Ma! Ya came out to meet me?

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.256
You betcha. Muh son's done come home!

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.846
Who's this? Is this your mother, Noto?

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.176
She shore is. This here's muh mom.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.266
I 'preciate ya lookin' after muh boy.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.646
Well now, as long as she's here,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.106
why don't you chat with your mom until the supplies are ready?

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.186
Huh? Ya shore 'bout that?

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.840
Thank ya mightily!

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.946
Takeru, ya done gone at gotten even bigger, aint'cha?

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.616
Huh, ya reckon? Ma, is Pa still doin' okay?

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.996
Takeru, don'tcha go worryin' 'bout us none.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.376
S'long's ya go to Tokyo, fetch yerself a purdy bride,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.176
and come on back home to us...

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.426
What's wrong, Ma? Ya look like ya got the blues.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.016
Oh, do I? Takeru, ya got'cher self a mission, ain'tcha?

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.096
Never you fret.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.056
Is somethin' the matter?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.750
Y'all kin tell me!

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.606
Huh? Someone's done tore up the fields?

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.566
Yeah, just a mite.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.026
But folks in the village ain't got no reason to do this.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.060
Who in tarnation'd do this?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.246
Thank you very much.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.956
Where are you headed to?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.036
Someplace farther west.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.916
I think we're headed toward a spatial rift.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.400
"Destination"

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.466
Watch out for bandits on the road. Also, once you leave here,

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.676
there's a strange gas in the air.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.886
Gas?

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.386
This is the place where we're heading to, right?

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.500
How come the whole continent seems to be shifted here?

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.476
Juggernaut, lead the way.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.606
Oh, yes, sir!

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.696
Sorry, Ma and Pa. Gotta go do muh mission.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.356
Ain't no time to hunt down the rascal's been wreckin' the fields.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.036
Never ya mind. Takeru, you just go 'bout doin' what ya gotta be doin'.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.706
Do a proper job, now, so's yer not draggin' the others down.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.496
Mm-hmm, you betcha!

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.360
I'm a Fire Soldier, y'know.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.206
We're heading out!

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.046
Next time ya come home, bring back a purdy bride with ya.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.886
A-A bride?

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.846
Here we go. Let's uncover the Evangelist's secrets!

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.096
Okay then, please excuse us!

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.096
Y'all take care, now!

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.130
We'll be back later!

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.470
"Episode 7: Road to the Oasis"

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.286
I told them to wear gas masks.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.826
...Yeah! ...Yeah!

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.706
Hell yeah!

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.400
...Ho yeah! ...Ho yeah!

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.796
I mean, I did tell them.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.926
That there's a gas prevalent around here

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.306
that is fast-acting and acts like a stimulant.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.556
...Hell yeah! ...Hell yeah!

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.636
You go, Juggernaut!

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.766
Ho! Ho! Ho!

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.526
Hello? Mama? I'm not coming home tonight!

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.656
Huh? Where am I staying? There's no way I'm telling you!

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.156
I mean, I'm on the Chinese Peninsula! This phone call's not getting through!

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.576
Woo-hoo! It's hot! If it's gonna be hot, I'm gonna dance!

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.286
I clear my mind of mundane thoughts, and I am cool.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.996
Oh, hostile rocks sighted!

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.046
Preparing to intercept! Set!

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.126
Whirr! Clank!

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.950
Click! Fire!

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.596
Hostiles obliterated!

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.466
Yay!

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.000
It must be those underground gases coming from those cracks in the surface.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.476
Lieutenant Pan, do you know what our mission is?

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.146
To find the cause of the Great Cataclysm 200 years ago

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.236
and anything to do with Adolla Bursts around that spatial rift, duh!

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.286
At least we're still clear about that much.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.390
Of course we are.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.206
Hey, you kids! Knock off that stupid horsing around and behave!

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.416
...Yes, Sensei...Yes, Sensei.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.376
Where are we heading right now?

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.636
To a location northwest of here.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.386
We're heading to a place that measures high in Adolla Bursts.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.676
It will take a while to get there,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.080
so please don't use up your energy goofing around.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.790
I hope we get there soon.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.106
We might find some intelligence connected to the Evangelist,

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:35.526
and how it relates to the 250-year-old Great Cataclysm and Adolla Bursts.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.616
Whoa, crap, what's that?

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.166
It's like that rock has been watching us this whole time.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.206
Tamaki, you freaked out?

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.086
No, I'm not!

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.456
It's too regular to have been created by weathering.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.376
No simple natural phenomenon would make that happen.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.096
Could the Adolla Bursts created by the Great Cataclysm have affected it?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.016
Wow, the turn of the century is terrifying!

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.516
I cleared my mind of mundane thoughts, and now I'm cold.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.630
Put a sock in it. There's still some time before we get there, so go to sleep.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.356
H-Help me!

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.760
What? I heard a voice coming from outside!

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.600
Huh?!

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:28.376
Wh-What the...? Are you kidding me?! Am I tripping on gas and seeing things?!

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.166
No, I'm stone cold sober, and I saw it, too.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.860
Then, that voice I heard asking for help came from that huge thing?

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.426
No! It was me!

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.750
Are you guys from the Xinqing Dao base? Save me!

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.976
Whew, that was close. That's what happens when you raid Giant Worm turf.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.646
Hey, who said you could hop on?! You're one that thing is after!

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.946
Don't drag us into the middle of this!

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.010
Uh, wait, Ogun...

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.480
...That mole just talked! ...That mole just talked!

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.416
You abominable infernal familiar! I'll feed you right to that earthworm!

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.586
Whoa! S-Stop!

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.716
A potato?!

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.176
Judging by the feel, size, and smell...

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.080
...there's no doubt about it. This is one of our potatoes!

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.516
Are you the one who ruined my family's field?!

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.356
S-Spare me! This is your first time in the area, right? I know it well!

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.856
If you'll let me, I'll get you to your destination safely!

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.606
That is a whole different matter!

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.406
Pan-sensei, here it comes!

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.100
Watch my driving technique!

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.206
Sorry, this is too much! Shinra, Ogun, do something!

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.166
Let's go, Ogun!

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.770
Just as I was getting bored, too!

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.520
Yoruba Spear!

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.136
Ogun, I'm gonna draw the earthworm away!

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.200
Yoruba Forge!

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.750
"Yoruba Forge"

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.306
Over here, you earthworm bastard!

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.976
This area is Giant Worm territory!

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.356
If don't move around carefully, you'll get two or three of them attacking!

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.696
For that matter, where are you guys headed?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.616
We're headed for a spatial rift.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.326
Rift? Oh, I know that area well.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.496
You know it?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.480
Do I know it? That's where I...

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.956
That's where you guys are headed?

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.466
I anticipated a harsh environment here, because of the Adolla Bursts,

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.336
but apparently, it's also a place where animals speak our language, too.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.580
That was an oasis for all of us.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.976
If they hadn't have come there,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.726
I wouldn't have had to steal these potatoes.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:57.186
If you guys are going there, then so am I. I want to take back the Oasis!

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.470
Monster earthworm, you'll have to face Shinra-Man!

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.230
Hey, over here, you earthworm bastard!

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.086
Hey, hey, hey!

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.650
Whoa!

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.176
We've gotten the earthworm pretty far away from the others, huh?

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.790
Our diversion is a success!

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.566
It looks like the earthworm is giving up.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.840
Nicely done. Get back here!

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.826
Now that we're here, we can relax.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.746
Who the hell are you?!

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.166
He's a dirty potato-thieving mole!

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.480
What do you have to say for yourself?

00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:00.006
I'm here from the Oasis further to the west.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:06.506
Unlike this wilderness, it has both plant life and water. A true paradise.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.426
An oasis in a wasteland like this?

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.886
I find that hard to believe.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:18.420
I had lots of friends there, but they were all driven out of the Oasis.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.986
Huh?

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.606
There are crows in this land, huh?

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.276
Ah, is that...?

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.486
Hey, Yata!

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.680
Hmm? You guys wait here.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.326
Hey, Scop, who are these guys?

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.706
That crow is one of my friends from the Oasis.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:44.086
You're soldiers from Xinqing Dao? We don't see you this far inland too often.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.886
I went to borrow some potatoes from there and got caught.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.216
What are you, dense?

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.886
Stay underground the rest of your life rather than get caught!

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.146
First a talking mole, now a talking crow.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.766
Hey, we're Fire Soldiers!

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.266
Fire Soldiers?

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.146
What are your kind doing all the way out here?

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.856
We're here on an investigation.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.066
We can sort this out later. We're camping here for the night.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.236
While we won't have any trouble making a fire,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.560
it will be a pain if we wait until it's dark.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.126
Hmm-hmm, toasted marshmallows!

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.336
You say you're going to the Oasis to investigate Adolla Bursts?

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.296
That's what we're doing, all right.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.346
Is the fact that you can speak in our language due to Adolla, too?

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:36.936
Huh? No idea. Most, like the guys behind us, can't speak.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.686
How about you tell us more about yourselves now?

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.936
You said you were driven out of the Oasis?

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.106
Yeah.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.906
One day, a mysterious group just showed up.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:54.036
Without a word, they started attacking those of us who lived at the Oasis.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.876
We've been chased out of the Oasis ever since.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.666
Which is why you ran out of food, and went to steal those potatoes.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.756
So that's what happened.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.836
My head had gone from vole-like to vociferous!

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.126
"Vole-like"

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.240
"Vociferous"

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.016
It sure gets dark without any city lights, huh?

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.410
Yeah.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.146
Hmm? Hey, look at that.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.806
What are those lights?

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.896
Yeah, you're right. It was too bright during the day to see them.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.430
Over here, too. They're all over the place.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.560
Awesome. This is so pretty. Like stars scattered across the ground.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.140
What are they, though?

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.296
I-Infernals?

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.006
Y-You mean, all of them?

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.636
You can see those? I can't see them at all with my night blindness.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.490
You have sharp eyes.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.976
Those are Infernals, just like you said.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.686
Some have been wandering around since the Great Cataclysm 250 years ago.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:08.396
Infernals don't die until they're put to rest. I'd heard that before, but...

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.316
We need to hurry and put them to rest.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.446
What, just us?

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.946
Forget it. There's too many of them.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.326
I've heard the stories. Over on your island across the sea,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.746
you kill your Infernals, right?

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.456
Kill... Well, yeah.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.126
Also the ground is unstable down there.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:31.216
If you're careless, it'll crumble beneath you, and you'll go face down into lava.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.870
Give it up.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.556
What's the deal with you guys, anyway?

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.226
Beats me. I don't know.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.016
We never thought twice about what we were

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.710
until you humans came along and considered us unusual.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.010
Those are all Infernals...

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.616
And it's not just those people, either.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.100
There are other Infernals still burning throughout the world.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.996
For their sake as well,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.216
we have to find out the truth about the Great Cataclysm and Adolla Bursts.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.450
I'm going to go get Tamaki. She can at least say a prayer for them.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.566
The Oasis is just up ahead.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.936
It's been an uneventful trip, thanks to my navigation, right?

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.696
Do you trust me a little more now?

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.196
Trust hell. There's too much about this area we just don't know about.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:42.036
We'll take any help we can get, moles and crows included.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.746
Once you climb up that rock, you can see the whole Oasis.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.836
Aw... We have to climb this?

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.876
Yeah, there's no way.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.046
I'm going on ahead to see what the situation is.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.716
I'll go on ahead, too, sir.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.120
Be careful.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.716
Okay, let's go.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.476
You're a human, and you can fly?

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.686
Hey, you with all the hair and the mask,

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:07.516
you don't have to worry about the gas here, thanks to the Oasis.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.040
Really?

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.356
You're right. Doesn't seem to be an issue, huh?

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.196
...I'll bet you that we could grow some great potatoes here.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.116
...Again with the potatoes? ...I'll bet you that we could grow some great potatoes here.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.576
The breeze is pretty gentle around here.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.866
Fly quietly, now.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.116
Got it.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.860
We'll look from behind here. Be sure to stay low.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.070
This area is the only one with plant life...

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.506
It is all thanks to the Tabernacle.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.846
The Tabernacle?

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.676
You can see it over there, right?

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.580
What are you talking about?

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.936
...What's that doing here?! ...You idiot! Stay low!

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.606
You know about the Tabernacle?

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:55.196
Do I know about it? That's the keystone of the Tokyo Empire...

00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:01.156
...Amaterasu, isn't it? What is it doing here?

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.576
There's no way I'd mistake that.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.326
Hey, you'll draw attention! Crouch down!

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:10.876
That's something Vulcan's ancestors were supposed to have built.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.796
Shinra-kun is right.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.796
It's a little bit smaller, but that's Amaterasu.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.716
Is it really Amaterasu?

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.006
Even if it isn't,

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.766
the fact that something identical to it exists here is strange enough itself.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.886
We'll need to get down there and start investigating.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:30.170
The Tabernacle is at the center of the Oasis. I'll show you the way. Follow me.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.396
There are man-made items here and there, huh?

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.696
Yeah. Over there, too.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.326
There are a lot of things here from the time before the Great Cataclysm.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.996
These trees look perfectly healthy.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.746
The Tabernacle is up ahead to the northwest.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.836
Hey, if the Tabernacle is the same as Amaterasu,

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.666
it means that the Tabernacle's energy source is an Adolla Burst, right?

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.086
Is the Adolla Burst the reason why all this nature has returned here?

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:04.676
Weren't Vulcan's ancestors the ones who built Amaterasu in the first place?

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.806
History says that the Holy Sol Temple and Vulcan-kun's ancestors built it,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.686
but depending on whether Tokyo's Amaterasu or this Tabernacle

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:14.816
was the first one built, that could change.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.896
So there's a chance the one in Tokyo came second.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.196
Either way,

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.406
if this much of nature has been reborn through the power of an Adolla Burst,

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.746
it means that they will be useful in reviving the world, right?

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.956
Adolla Bursts really are unsullied, sacred flames.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.900
Or, on the other hand, they could be the cause of the world's destruction.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.400
We're getting close to the center of the Oasis.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.796
Hold up!

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:48.176
Look! We've arrived at a pillar. These pillars surround the Tabernacle.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.306
Then, we're almost there!

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:50.686
"Tabernacle" "Pillar" "Pillar"

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.396
But the area ahead is also the bandits' territory.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.436
Since our objective here is to investigate,

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.186
we'd like to avoid fighting if we can.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.816
You can't possibly fight against this bunch!

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.696
He's right.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.850
There's no reasoning with them.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.036
Lieutenant Pan, we could be closing in

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.746
on the very core of the mystery behind human combustion.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:17.456
Even if Scop is right, and we can't negotiate with this group,

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.166
we need to investigate, even if it means by force.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.636
Yeah! Yeah! You go, hero!

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.546
That's outside the scope of our mission.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:28.330
We can't just rush in and start fighting outside parties.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.516
I won't let anyone stand in the way of investigating the Great Cataclysm.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.596
Are you starting again?

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.976
We can't just turn around after coming this far!

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.476
I agree with Kusakabe, sir.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.816
Of course we aren't going to. But we are Fire Soldiers, not the military.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.946
Combat will always be our last option.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.116
We'll settle this by peaceful negotiation if we can.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:53.576
Just a minute! I led you all the way here, right? Take our Oasis back for us!

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.786
Not until we speak with them and see how they respond.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:55.916
"Aaah"

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.956
I already told you, there's no reasoning with them!

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.166
I'm begging you, help us!

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.320
Ee-yow!

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.466
Infernal dogs?

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.006
What do you mean, "Infernal dogs"? Those are Hell Hounds!

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.596
Fine, whichever! Run!

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.226
I told you, there's no reasoning with them!

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.056
No, not if they're dogs!

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.356
Get up in the trees!

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.726
Wah! I'm scared! Help me! Someone help me!

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:25.340
Ashes thou wert and art. May thy soul return to the great flame of fire.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.010
Látom.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.366
Freeing dogs from the flames is the job of Fire Soldiers,

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.956
the same as it is for people, right?

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.836
Tamaki...

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.046
If they were dogs, you should have said so from the start.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.190
Like there's any humans around here.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.386
My friends were killed by those dogs.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:55.516
Sure, we fought back! It's just... It's just what?

00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:00.920
Their boss is even worse, and there was nothing we could do about that one!

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.970
Protect the forest.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.050
Is that... an Adolla Link?

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.826
Protect... Where is it coming from?

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.980
...the forest.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.560
Protect the forest.

The Tabernacle lies in the center of the forest.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.486
It is a cherished location that was once taken from Scop-san and the others.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.526
Why was something so cherished taken away from them?

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.026
They came from beyond the spatial rift

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.536
