00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.230
There's a fire in the Arakawa Shopping District's bazaar.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.360
The source of the fire is a single Infernal.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.320
There's one casualty as well-- an employee at a fruit market.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.240
Understood.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.620
One casualty already?

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.830
Sister, please get ready.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.910
Yes, sir.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.080
Spider Net on!

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.750
The road has been closed off.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.290
We're okay over here, too!

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.220
Here it comes!

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.850
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.810
The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.770
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.820
May thy soul return to the great flame of fire.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.950
Launching Special Extinguishing Grenade!

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.160
Látom!

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080
We have finished putting her to rest.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.710
Sister! Is the Infernal-- Is my wife...?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.340
You are a member of the family?

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.510
My wife received the Holy Sol Temple's salvation...

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.720
...and has obtained the mercy of Sol, hasn't she?!

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.110
Yes. Your wife has passed on peacefully into the presence of the Lord.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.370
It means that the Holy Sol Temple's scriptures

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.330
would be presenting teachings that are incorrect.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.870
It's possible the Evangelist and the Holy Sol Temple are connected?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.340
I mustn't dwell on such worldly thoughts.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.970
"Episode 18: The Holy Woman's Anguish"

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.560
Let's see... Those flechettes, too?

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.480
Yes, sir. That's all of it.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.940
We've had a lot of callouts recently,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.240
so our unbaptized equipment is starting to pile up.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.160
But the sister can't carry all of this by herself.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.200
Huh? You want me to accompany the sister to the Central Church

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.450
to baptize our equipment?

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.790
Yeah, otherwise known as the Baptism Church. You've never been, have you?

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.630
No, sir.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.460
The equipment we need baptized is in there.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.130
All right, sir.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.420
Excuse me. I'm ready to go at any time.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.090
I'm looking forward to going with you today.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.970
Right! Let's go get 'er done! Yay!

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.430
"Yay!!"

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.850
How adorable is that?

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.310
Church date with the sister... Church date with the sister...

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.150
That's not too heavy, is it?

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.650
Piece of cake!

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.530
It must be a real chore doing this alone all the time.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.280
Normally, there isn't this much to carry.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.410
"Power cobra"
I need to work out so I don't get outdone by the rest of you.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.960
Th-The sister's milky-skinned, supple upper arm...!

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.170
No! It's wrong to look at the sister like that!

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.420
"Impermissible power cobra"
That is an off-limits upper arm!

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.720
"Tokyo Empire, Chuo-ku, Central Church" "known as the 'Baptism Church'"

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.140
This is the Baptism Church?

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.770
This water--is this where the equipment is baptized?

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.230
It will take some time before I'm finished, so please, feel free to look around.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.570
Right. Okay, I'll see you later.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.410
It doesn't look like there's going to be time for a nice stroll with the sister.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.460
Of course not. This is work.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.920
Even a church as pretty as this one

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.630
has the specter of the Evangelist overshadowing its origins.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.760
The sister is conducting herself as cheerfully as ever,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.890
but her smile seems a bit awkward.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.770
If she's concerned about something, I'd be happy to be of help to her.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.690
Hallowed Lord, who shineth in the heavens,

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.980
may the blessings of baptism be upon those that reach thy presence.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.900
The Evangelist is the one who founded the Holy Sol Temple.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.660
Who exactly am I offering up my faith to?

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.540
Sister Iris, your worldly thoughts are quite evident.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.450
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.080
I have to say, it's pretty here.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.840
Oh, if it isn't Kusakabe-kun, from the 8th.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.590
Long time no see, Lieutenant Huo Yan!

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.590
You don't see that very often here.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.100
I'm here having some pacification equipment baptized.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.230
It's admirable that you are so earnest about coming for the baptisms.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.940
What do you mean by that, sir?

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.820
You must have heard things about the Holy Sol Temple and the Evangelist.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.940
Whatever is being said, some units have been neglecting baptisms lately.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.030
Huh?

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.830
Even Karim seems to be growing disenchanted with the Holy Sol Temple.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.620
Could that be bothering the sister, too?

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.120
Lieutenant Huo Yan, what do you think?

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.090
When I heard the Holy Sol Temple may have been created by the Evangelist,

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.920
it came as a shock. However,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.890
the Holy Sol Temple reveres the Sun and its fire, not the Evangelist.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.560
As long as we have the Sun that I've venerated for so long,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.560
my faith will not be shaken.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.520
On the other hand, I have become aware of something frightening.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.980
If the Evangelist is nothing more than a sham,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.070
she has been having others worship her as a god,

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.900
while enriching herself this whole time.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.200
That's true.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.910
But the truth of the matter is, the Evangelist lurks in the shadows.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.540
As such, it lends veracity to the idea that the Evangelist's people

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.080
are plotting to destroy the world.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.500
You're saying that our faith is dangerous?

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.930
People need faith.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.350
We need something to believe in.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.520
Lieutenant Huo Yan, was it because of your faith

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.480
that you were able to protect Lieutenant Karim without hesitation?

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.910
I suppose so. Just as I have faith in the Holy Sol Temple,

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.160
I also believe in Karim.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.910
It's a hard thing to lose something you believe in.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.420
If you have the power to believe, you can save your friends.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.840
The power to believe...

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.300
--You're going to, Benimaru.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.970
--No matter what anyone else says, Asakusa is your town, Waka. --You're going to, Benimaru.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.260
--No matter what anyone else says, Asakusa is your town, Waka.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.140
They don't want to hear just anyone's words;

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.760
--they want to hear the words of Beni.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.390
--You men know what I mean, right? --they want to hear the words of Beni.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.520
If it means supporting Waka,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.020
I'll offer my two-bit life as many times as I need to.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.020
It's because the 7th has such unfaltering hearts

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.190
that they've become as strong as they are.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.740
But if we lose the things we believe in...

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.950
I apologize for keeping you waiting.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.200
I wasn't praying wholeheartedly and got yelled at.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.540
Not at all. You're fine.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.040
Someone as faithful as the sister...

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.290
Well, should we head back?

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.630
O-Oh, um...

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.430
There's someplace I'd like to stop by on the way, if we could.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.850
What is this?

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:02.060
The National Holy Sol Cemetery. It's where all the clergy get buried.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.430
Oh, yeah?

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.940
Whenever I come for baptisms, I always stop by here.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:12.820
I visit the graves of the sisters from the convent where I grew up.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.530
Amazing!

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.410
Look at all the sunflowers!

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.160
Sunflowers face the sun to bloom.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.040
That's why they plant them near graves--

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.960
so the dead know the way to the Sun.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.300
This way. Will you pray with me?

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.760
Of course!

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.890
"Rest in Peace"

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.180
That's quite a dazzling display.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.060
That's Hibana nee-san's doing. How are they supposed to rest like this?

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.270
Captain Hibana did?

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.270
These flowers are tidy. It looks like she just came by recently.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.240
You might not guess it, but she did love everyone from the convent.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.030
She comes to visit regularly.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.280
She does overdo it a bit, though.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.870
"Rest in Peace"

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:10.920
How is everyone? Sister Clematis, you shouldn't eat too much.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.760
Sister Sakura, be sure not to stay up too late.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.340
Next time, I'll come by before Nee-san jazzes everything up, okay?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.560
Say, Sister... Yes?

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.140
Maybe it's just my imagination...

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.440
...but if there's anything troubling you, perhaps I can help?

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.070
Is it the matter with the Evangelist?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.700
Is it that obvious? I guess I'm not very practiced.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.410
You're always pushing Vulcan's buttons and stuff--

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.540
going straight after whatever you desire.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.910
You're not difficult to read, is all.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:53.670
Oh, but I mean, your forthrightness is a good thing. It lightens everyone's mood.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.220
Shinra-san, what do you think about the Holy Sol Temple?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.310
What do you think about those of us who believe in it?

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.680
Huh? What do I--

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.850
What was that?!

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.480
Oh, Father...!

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.900
Are you hurt?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.990
The priest just suddenly...!

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.400
An Infernal!

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.950
Why? He is always praying! Why would he...?

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.290
I'll put him to rest!

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.870
Please keep back!

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.050
Sister! The prayer!

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.510
R-Right.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:45.760
The flame is the soul's breath. The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.180
Ashes thou wert and art. May thy soul...

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.860
...return to the great flame of fire!

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.780
Látom.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.920
Why? Oh, Father!

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.250
He prayed to God every day.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.050
Just what good are our prayers?

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:25.010
Sister... Does God not have any mercy?

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.220
Látom.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.360
It is fortunate that there was a Fire Soldier here.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.310
Oh, no...

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:43.740
The father was such a good man. What does God take our prayers for?

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.660
About what we were discussing before...

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.540
If the Evangelist was the one who created the Holy Sol Temple,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:59.750
doesn't that mean that the God we worship is the Evangelist?

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.380
The Evangelist...?

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.800
An inhuman being beyond human understanding.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.680
When I experienced that Adolla Link,

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.470
I felt the impression that she was just such an otherworldly being.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:17.060
That might just be close to who we picture as "God" in our minds.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.610
But this God wants people to destroy the world,

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.070
and wishes death and suffering upon us.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:27.870
If we clergy members believe in her teachings...

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.660
...then we are also leading people to their deaths.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.330
That's not true!

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.250
I'm the one who killed him.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.420
No! Shinra-san, you gave him rest from the torment of the flames!

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.220
Yes. There was no choice but to put him to rest.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:50.050
I realize that, but my feet are still tingling, even now,

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.220
and my heart is fluttering.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.350
Once, Captain Obi said to me

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.270
that the most terrifying thing about this job is getting accustomed to it.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.400
I thought I wanted to get a little used to this, but I couldn't.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.450
Still,

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:11.240
that's precisely the reason why we Fire Soldiers need sisters.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.200
I ran into Lieutenant Huo Yan earlier.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.000
He said that the Sun he prays to is unmistakably there,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.130
and that his faith has nothing to do with the Evangelist.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.210
I suppose that's true.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.680
So you please keep looking forward, too, Sister.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.470
It's because you see the Sun--

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:38.890
see its light that the rest of us can keep fighting.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.480
To those of us at the 8th, you are kind of like our own sunflower.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.570
I'm... the 8th's... ...sunflower?

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.620
But irises aren't sunflowers.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.200
Right, sorry!

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.800
Thank you very much. You've made me... very happy.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.340
But please don't overdo it, okay?

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.430
Sure.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.140
I'm fine.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:24.060
Sister Iris, that was a very good prayer.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.980
Thank you very much.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.900
Okay... Do you want me to carry one?

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.530
Oh, no. The heavy lifting is our job, after all.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.910
If I had to, I could even carry you, as well!

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.370
Muscles! Muscles!

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.910
Huh? That would be too much!

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.750
I could totally do it! C'mon, c'mon!

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.500
I-I'm on.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.130
Oh, I can do it.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.170
Wah! Are you all right?!

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.430
Compared to all the captain's gear, this is nothing!

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.680
Shinra-san...

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.310
...the next time I have something on my mind, I'll come to you with it first.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.190
Right. I'll be glad to.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.530
I promise.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.490
What's this? His training is complete?

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.710
At last, he has completed his training.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.170
The 8th is finished for sure this time.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.340
The Fire Blast departs.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.460
Or rather...

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.800
...off he goes.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.970
"Episode 18: The Man, Assault"

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.730
In my clash with the 8th in the Nether,

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.820
I was to eliminate them all as the Slaughterer.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.320
However, I ran into an unexpected assassin there...

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.030
Tamaki Kotatsu. Despite her innocent appearance,

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.700
her shamelessness is unparalleled.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.420
She makes my skin crawl. If I'm going to bring down the 8th,

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.840
I'll have to take her out first.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.300
That's why I've been training. Day in and day out, sunrise to sunset, I trained.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.810
All to resist that damnably audacious woman!

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.640
I read pornographic magazines.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.440
I also took in lewd books, and even viewed salacious videos.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.150
I looked at everything!

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.110
I have overcome the female form.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.530
Just you wait, Tamaki Kotatsu.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.620
Away!

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.660
"Letter of challenge"

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.750
What's this?

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.790
"I will expect you at the picturesque vacant lot in 2-chome."

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.470
Is this a new style of love letter?!

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.920
"Vacant lot"

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:59.220
It's you... Assault, the Bloody Fire Blast!

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.140
You have guts, coming here alone, Tamaki Kotatsu.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.020
Why are you here?!

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.560
There's no reason to explain to someone whose death is imminent. Die!

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.200
The wrinkle in her underwear-- It's so sensuous!

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.990
Damn it! I never realized it was this bad!

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.910
Off I go...

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.990
It's different when it comes to the real thing.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:26.790
Nya!

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.880
What? Assault failed?

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.670
It seems that this target is exceptionally powerful.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.010
So where is Assault right now?

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.850
Apparently embarking on new training.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.560
I was a fool for thinking I knew what I was dealing with from paper and video.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.980
The real thing... The real thing is so much different.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.940
In which case... off I go!

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.200
"Club Chupa Cabaret"

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.150
Away!

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.490
Welcome, sir.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.240
--Do you have someone specific in mind? --One bottle coming up.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.160
You sure your breasts haven't gotten even bigger?

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.410
Ha-ha-ha, oh please!

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.040
Scythe-san, what's wrong? Are you crying again?

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.960
My daughter simply refuses to speak to me.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.720
Something about this place is giving me goosebumps all over.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.970
I really do love Makami, though. I'm a good father, right?

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.100
How do you do?

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.810
I'm Saki. It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.850
This is dynamite.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:35.150
Eh? What's the big idea, wearing a tuxedo? Did you sneak out of a wedding?

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.990
Mister, I can tell, there's something different about you.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.570
Th-There is?

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.030
You're not like ordinary men. I can tell.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.830
I'm really not like other men.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.580
There's no reason why I can't beat Tamaki Kotatsu.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.840
I'm surprisingly good at talking to women, huh?

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.920
Perhaps I actually have a gift when it comes to dealing with women.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.220
Which means it's on, Tamaki Kotatsu.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.300
Away!

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.430
No!

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.220
How come?!

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.440
D-Don't look at me.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.900
Wh-What is this?! This innocent bashfulness?!

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.070
It's different when it comes to amateurs!

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.370
She's good. She's too good.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:33.670
I've never encountered a foe this formidable before.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.210
Which is all the more reason why I have to get past this.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.710
I am the Assassin of the Abyss.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:43.510
I am Assault, the Bloody Fire Blast, after all.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:53.020
"Edogawa-ku Waterproofing Day"

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.350
After my third defeat,

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.810
I went someplace where strong gusts tended to cause wardrobe malfunctions,

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.100
and waited for them to happen.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.400
My finely-honed visual acuity would not let anything go unnoticed.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.360
--Gah! Knock it off, you pervy wind! Sicko! Deviant!

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.360
--Amateur panties! Now to burn their bashfulness into my retinas! --Gah! Knock it off, you pervy wind! Sicko! Deviant!

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.330
My training is complete. There is no factor that can defeat me now.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.370
You have at last conquered it?

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.460
Yes.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:25.470
He stopped my arrow with a single finger. His skills are absolutely sharp.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.430
Assault, off you go, right?

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.520
"Off I go"

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.900
Off I go... Assault...

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.070
Enough, already!

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.200
What the hell is your problem?!

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.410
This will be the last time.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.080
Glimpse.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:56.040
I've grown, as well. I can withstand that much.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.500
Try as hard as you want, it's still no use!

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:03.710
Yes, you're right. It's no use, just like you say.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:08.340
I know it, as well. I can see how this plays out.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.140
No matter how often I try, there is no chance...

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.310
...of me winning this fight.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.440
It's different when it comes to an opponent I like.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:19.730
Away!

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.190
"The Man"

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.650
"Imperfect"

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.990
"To be continued"

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.710
"Next time"

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.420
A communique arrives at the 8th from the Imperial Armed Forces.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.510
Written within it is an invitation to a new war.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.890
No, I don't want this!

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.770
I'm going back to the Armed Forces?

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:28.530
"Episode 19: The Oze Family"

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:24.230
Next time on Fire Force, Season 2, episode 19, "The Oze Family."
