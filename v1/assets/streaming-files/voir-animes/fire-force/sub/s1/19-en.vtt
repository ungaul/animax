WEBVTT

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.550
As the world was being covered in ash, one man appeared.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.890
He would be later be called Raffles I.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.680
Raffles took his disciples and left on a journey in search of light.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.770
At the end of his journey, he found an "unsullied flame,"

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.780
and brought forth the light that would be mankind's salvation.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.690
Any time now, there will be a company

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.980
that finds out about us being in the Nether.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.400
You're right. That actually works in our favor.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.610
Notify Yona at the gate to be on guard, as well.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.870
We will make ready and scout around.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.370
No need to scout. The man who is coming...

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.450
...is the one with the Adolla Link.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Wh-Whoa!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.340
Shinra, clean up in here before you read your book.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.470
Hmm... later.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.550
Are you sure? If you're a bad boy, you'll be taken to the Nether.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.190
I'm not afraid of the Nether.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.390
If you ever get taken to the Nether, Sho,

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.430
your big brother will definitely come to rescue you, okay?

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.940
Th-- The Nether... you say?

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.440
After Licht finished examining what's left of Vulcan's workshop,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.280
he discovered that the Evangelist's men are hiding in the Nether.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.990
The Holy Sol Temple teaches that the Nether

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.750
is an unclean place where the great Sol's light doesn't reach.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.420
Like the sister said, the Nether, or the area beneath the Tokyo Empire,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.420
is considered a forbidden land.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.750
Those who are using it as their base

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.010
could be heretics who oppose the Holy Sol teachings.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.850
As for the Nether, Tokyo once had subway trains that ran beneath it.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.810
Most of them crumbled and were buried during the Day of the Cataclysm,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.440
but I have determined that there are some places underground

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.690
where the caverns still remain.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.820
From the items that Dr. Giovanni left behind,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.360
and the regions where man-made Infernals have appeared,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.410
I've narrowed the area down.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.240
"Yotsuya"

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.280
Tomorrow, we're heading to the base

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.500
of the people who are creating man-made Infernals.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.500
That's where the mysteries behind human combustion are sure to be.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.670
We're not laying anyone to rest. This is a fight with our lives at stake.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.640
We're bringing your brother back.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.010
Yes, sir!

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.430
Company, let's get ready for tomorrow. Dismissed!

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.520
Tamaki, do you have a moment?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.600
Yes, sir.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.950
High-ho... Silver... High-ho...

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.420
It's hot... Where am I...?

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.800
Sister...?

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.900
An earthquake.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.190
It doesn't feel like a big one.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.900
There sure have been quite a few lately.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.760
"Special Fire Force Company 8" "Engineer" "Vulcan"

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.800
This is our first call-out.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.970
Gives you the jitters, huh?

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.430
You look out of place in that, Licht.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.440
I've got my lab coat on for an inner layer.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.730
Is there some reason for that?

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.280
We're finally starting to look like a company.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.950
You're right.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.960
The Nether is a place

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.470
you need to obtain special permission from the church to go into.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.180
Ordinarily, going in there would be impossible.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.020
Only the 8th has permission to go into the Nether to investigate.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.230
The Holy Sol Temple has not permitted people to go into the Nether en masse.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.570
The Nether is an unclean place,

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.030
which is connected to Hell, and where inhuman creatures live.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.030
It's super-scary there.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.580
"Episode 19: Into the Nether"

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.880
I can't believe trains used to run under the ground.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.050
This is the entrance to the Nether?

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.260
You freaking out?

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.930
I'm not afraid of the Nether.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.940
You must be joking.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.980
We're really going in?

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.820
My mama is going to be mad at me for going near this place.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.990
Vulcan-kun, you seem okay with this.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.570
Yeah. I don't make a habit of it, but I have been in here a few times,

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.080
inspecting the water treatment facilities.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.750
I don't make a habit of it, though.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.210
Are we really going in?

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.080
Stop making such a fuss.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.380
All right, I will now offer a prayer.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.840
If you please.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.850
Ever do we worship the rising Sun.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.600
Please grant thy light to the souls of the innocent.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.980
Látom.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.270
Huh?

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.150
Sister, please step back.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.030
It opened on its own... It's a magic door!

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.990
That's impossible.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.490
Are we being invited in?

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.700
Oh, it opened, it opened! It looks like the electricity is running.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.040
That was you?! Don't scare us like that!

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.750
Wah, the dark Nether... Not the Nether! I'm scared!

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.800
So, what's inside? Let me see.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.770
Wah! Whoa, I went in!

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.560
Captain, you're too spooked.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.020
It's dark.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.520
Well, it's the Nether.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.320
Wow! Is this for real? This is the Nether? Whoa...

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.530
Maki, some light.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.450
Oh, let's see... Yes, sir.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.870
Sputter, Flare...

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.670
A regular light would have been fine.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.710
Don't forget that what we're heading into is Hell.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:59.010
The Evangelist's base and the mysteries of human combustion are inside.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.600
Stay sharp and keep moving.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.140
--Yes, sir. --Yes, sir.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.600
Yona, let's stir things up.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.810
Artistically, and with creativity.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.240
Everyone, stay close!

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.200
When did--?!

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.580
Where did everyone go?!

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.460
Shinra-kun, I'm being pulled by something!

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.630
Shinra-kun, help me!

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.130
Inspector Licht!

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.550
Wait, Shinra! Don't get separated!

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.890
Iris, give me your hand!

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.640
Right!

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.060
--Make sure you don't let go! --Make sure you don't let go!

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.850
--Huh? --Huh?

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.980
This way! The fog is thinner this way! Hurry!

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.940
--Huh? --Huh?

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.240
--Huh?! --Huh?!

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.450
--Who are you?! --This way! This way!

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.040
No! Watch what you're doing!

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.550
Damn it, they got us. There are two life readings.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.640
It looks like there are just two of us here.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.060
You're the real captain, right?

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:36.650
And with those funny animal goggles, you're the real Vulcan.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:41.530
Sorry. I made these life-sensing goggles to counter Mirage.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.160
Who would have thought they'd use this much fog

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.490
and imposters against us at the same time?

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.660
I'm supposed to be a sloth.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.080
Oh.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:59.550
Thanks to Mirage and Yona's teamwork, we succeeded in dividing the enemy up.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.300
Send in Assault the Slaughterer.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.690
I'm going, too.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.570
Then again, Assault, the Bloody Fire Blast,

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.740
might just wipe out the entire 8th all alone.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.930
Iris! I'm the real one!

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.470
I'm the real one!

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.060
U-Um... hmm...

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.560
How are you having trouble with this? Any way you look at her, she's the fake!

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.730
That's not true! She's the fake! This is outrageous! Hmph!

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.860
I was the one who was holding your left hand, remember?

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.650
And I have flame ears. See?

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.610
Yes, you're right about that.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:11.120
She's trying to do something I can't do to trick you! How cruel!

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.710
How mean! I could cry!

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.250
This could be a cleverly-set trap.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.800
Aw, jeez! Iris, there's no convincing you!

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.470
Also, she has the voice of an old man!

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.220
Oh...

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.690
You're the real Tamaki-san!

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.400
Yes, I'm Tamaki...

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.620
--I'm gonna take my frustration toward Iris out on you, pops! --Slink, slink, slink...

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.450
--Huh? Pops? --Slink, slink, slink...

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.330
Ah! Hey! Hold it! Hey!

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.590
You're first, are you? There are many others after you today.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.680
Assault. That's the name of the one who will kill you.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.020
"Knights of the Ashen Flame" "Slaughterer" "Assault"

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.560
I won't hold back.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.570
You're kidding me. All alone, here, in the Nether?

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.470
Oh, it's just a woman.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:56.390
You look frightened. Afraid of the dark?

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.810
We're about to show you an even greater terror.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:09.150
Thank goodness! I was anxious in here by myself. I thought you were ghosts.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.570
What's up with this woman? Has being in the dark made her crazy?

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.740
Kill her.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.200
Screw with us, will you?!

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.080
I'm not screwing with you.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.170
I can handle you as long as you're a person.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.590
Prepare to engage!

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.760
Set elevation angle to 90!

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.390
Pressure circuits check!

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.760
Power unit disengaged!

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.600
Thermal power charging!

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.600
Maintain formation!

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.560
You're Flail.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:49.320
I understand you're the one who roughed up my dear colleagues.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.570
Twin Hover Units Tekkyo, activate!

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:02.460
You look like you work out some, but what can you do by yourself?

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.040
We are combat pros.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.250
Oh, yeah? You don't look it.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.800
Don't you mock us!

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.050
A second generation, huh?

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.090
Fire! Fire!

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.720
That level of flame won't do any good, no matter how much you shoot.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.540
Why, you... little pest!

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.560
Ho...

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.400
In the name of the Evangelist, remission of death to the fool!

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.160
This fireball is my ability.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.990
I can control it at will.

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.250
Meteor Strike!

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.630
Let the flames crush you--

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.940
I don't care how brawny a woman you are, you're still a woman!

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.570
That didn't hurt!

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:59.820
Who... ...are you calling a gorilla cyclops?!

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.750
I have to hurry and meet up with the others.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.920
Iris, stand back.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.920
Right.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.510
He's a third generation, all right.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.690
Ho... Your resistance to flames is pretty high, at least.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.490
Are you all right?

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.160
Stay back!

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.040
I have other things to do today.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.500
Besides, enemies of the Evangelist or not,

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.960
I am not interested in beating up women and children.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.960
I will kill you all at once.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.060
Are you sure you want to go? You're supposed to be with the 1st.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.930
I don't want to force you to do anything.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:11.730
I may be on suspension, but right now, I'm a member of the 8th.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.070
I will go on your missions.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.330
Hey, I heard you're going to the Nether, too, huh?

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:29.250
If you ever get in trouble again, call for me anytime.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:34.750
I am a Fire Soldier! My job is to protect, not to be protected!

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.260
Come to think of it, you are a Fire Soldier.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.310
I wear the same coveralls, don't I?!

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.020
I can do this...

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.360
I'll protect you, Iris.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.700
Assault, Assassin of the Abyss, solemnly gets going.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:17.000
You do not run when I confront you. I applaud your courage.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:22.340
"Crimson Bullet." This is over now. Farewell!

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:29.640
Give me more credit than that!

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.850
She avoided it?!

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.690
Off I go...

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.450
Get off!

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.490
I can't see!

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:54.370
--She... got me... --Feels breezy...

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.630
Látom.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.050
I won't be done in so easily--

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.910
Látom.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.120
How about that? Did you see that, Kusakabe?

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.950
I can protect others by myself!

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.330
Are you sure you'd be okay with Shinra-san seeing that?

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.210
Oh, no... but all's well that ends well.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.050
You're someone I can turn to.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:59.440
It's dark, now. Don't get separated from me.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.520
Right!

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.030
"To be continued"

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.500
"Next time"

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.000
"Episode 20: Wearing His Pride"
