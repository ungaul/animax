"Inquiry Report"

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.350
These are the incident records that may be connected

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.690
to the White-Clad that we discovered the other day.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.150
The 8th's first fire. This is the research report from right after

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.490
the sister and Maki joined up.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.370
Come to think of it, how is it that the 8th came to be?

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.790
I haven't heard about what happened before I joined.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.590
Well, let's see. It has to do with the matter of the heart of the 8th.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.920
Lieutenant, tell them.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.840
Huh?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.680
You're the better talker. That's an order.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.520
"Solar Year 195"

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.150
"Tokyo Imperial Armed Forces"

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.940
"Yokota Base"

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.840
The darkness is illuminated

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.470
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.180
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.600
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.260
The end is illuminated

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.850
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.600
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.980
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.820
Flames rise to show us the way

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.490
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.960
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.210
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.930
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.760
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.810
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.360
Playthings that make sounds

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.070
and magic that chases pain away

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.150
are all precious treasures to me

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.780
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.710
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.550
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.050
I hear there has been another increase in Infernals lately.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.180
Maybe there's something better we could be doing

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.390
besides patrolling and investigating criminals.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.560
Infernals fall under the Special Fire Force's jurisdiction.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.400
Don't get any funny ideas.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.900
Sergeant Hinawa!

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.230
I'll see you tomorrow, sir.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.570
I don't recognize her.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.200
Could she be...?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.830
General Oze's daughter, Private Maki Oze.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.790
She's so thin.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.250
Is she all right?

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.670
She gives twice the effort of the others.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.460
She also trains even harder than she's told to.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.260
She'll build up her strength before you know it.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.680
Pretty impressive for being a general's daughter.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.760
She's still daddy's little girl, though, and only got in because of him.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.020
She's too kind... and desperately not cut out to be a soldier.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.810
All of the work she's putting in now will be for nothing.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.270
You're as harsh as ever, aren't you?

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.980
If she's trying that hard, you should be behind her.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.650
Wasted effort doesn't get to be called effort.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.400
She's no different from a goldbricker.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.410
I'm surprised you'd say something like that about such a cute girl.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.660
That's because you're too kind, Tojo.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.250
Something the matter with that gun?

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.380
I'm following the Special Fire Force and took it to be baptized at the church.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.300
Speaking of wastes.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.050
Waste? Between a gun that was baptized and one that wasn't,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.100
you'd rather be shot by the baptized gun, right?

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.270
How about it, Hinawa?

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.480
If you go to the church and have your gun baptized, too, just to try it,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.360
your point of view might change a little.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.070
I don't believe in Sol. It's not like the effects of shooting a gun change

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.660
just because it's been baptized.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.660
I've known you for a long time, and that's what I thought you'd say.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.130
How come someone as kind as you sticks with me, anyway?

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.960
Hinawa, you're not as cold a fish as you think you are.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.970
I mean, you are bussing my tray with yours.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.620
Tojo?!

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.620
Hinawa! Shoot!

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.170
Shoot me! While I'm still conscious!

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.090
Hurry up and shoot!

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.010
Shoot!

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.940
You'd rather be shot by the baptized gun, right?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.070
Wait--

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.090
Why couldn't I shoot him? I failed to shoot him...

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.060
Lieutenant Tojo's gun.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.140
I finished changing the owner's name to yours, as you requested.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.900
Thank you very much.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.170
The Blue Stripes have arrived!

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.550
We'll direct the civilians and check the spread of the fire

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.510
until they finish putting them to rest.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.600
Reporting in! I'm in charge of the Fire Fighters here, Akitaru Obi.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.060
We heard there were two Infernals.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.310
Yes. There are two, but they are currently in different locations.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.940
One is belligerent, and is currently running around inside our cordon.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.320
The other one is more docile, and staying inside this store.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.360
One of the two of them...

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.950
...isn't going to earn many points, huh?

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.160
Points?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.870
The situation is clear. You Fire Fighters pull back.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.210
We'll start with the live one. Leave the one with fewer points alone.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.510
Excuse me, Mr. Fireman, my husband is patiently enduring those flames.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.100
Please put him out of his misery quickly.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.690
There is an order of precedence we follow at a scene.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.900
You let us handle the arrangements of putting him to rest.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.070
Let's go!

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.070
P-Please, wait!

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.450
Excuse me.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.290
Wouldn't that just mean sending only two men in pursuit,

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.750
dividing your forces in two, and putting them both to rest?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:09.210
We are pros. There is such a thing as on-site judgment.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.840
You mean points?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.340
That's right.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.890
By assigning rankings to Infernals, and awarding points based on results,

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.890
I can maintain my men's morale.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.020
Maintain their morale?

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.520
Morale doesn't mean a damn when putting a person to rest, does it?

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.440
Don't second-guess our job, amateur.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.240
You Fire Fighters just get ready with the water.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.120
Nobuo-san, hang in there. Just hang in there.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.790
I'm sorry I can't do anything for you.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.620
Ma'am, if you like, I could take it upon myself

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.880
to put your husband to rest.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.500
Please, allow me.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.970
"Tokyo Fire Defense Agency"

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.430
What are you planning to do?

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.560
Who are you?

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.320
Sergeant Takehisa Hinawa, Tokyo Imperial Armed Forces.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.860
"Episode 11: Formation of Special Fire Force Company 8"

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.990
Beyond here is Blue Stripes territory.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.950
If a soldier like you or a Fire Fighter like me crosses this tape,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.330
we will be severely punished.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.840
Compared to the suffering of the Infernal inside,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.130
accepting punishment is no skin off my nose.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.340
You think so, too, don't you?

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.350
Sergeant Hinawa, do you have any experience fighting Infernals?

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:47.980
I turned my gun on a friend who became an Infernal the other day...

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.190
...but I couldn't shoot him.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.160
I am not a pious follower of Sol.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.080
Nonetheless, I could not shoot him with an unbaptized gun.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.500
Infernal sighted.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.340
Sergeant Hinawa, it's not about whether or not I believe in God,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:24.220
but how much I can do for the sake of a dying Infernal that I believe is important.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.350
Baptisms and prayers are a part of that belief.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.570
And they're also salvation to those who put Infernals to rest.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.450
I'll do it.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:51.380
The flame is the soul's breath. The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.300
Ashes thou wert and art. May thy soul...

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.430
Sergeant Hinawa, you are a kind man.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.400
You have courage.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.400
You're the one who has courage.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.530
If you hadn't taken action, I likely wouldn't have done anything.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:30.210
Making up your mind to move forward on your own isn't that difficult.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.420
It's easy to believe in yourself, after all.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.800
But trusting in someone else, taking action, and sacrificing yourself

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.550
are things that require a tremendous amount of courage.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.100
Today, Sergeant Hinawa, that courage... was yours.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.970
If so, then you're the king.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.730
That settles it!

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.280
I'm going to establish a Special Fire Force company.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.910
I want to be a Special Fire Soldier, and pursue the mystery of Infernals.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.370
How can I sit back and do nothing while the world burns down around me?

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.540
I'm going to need men like you in my company,

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.170
who cherish life above anything else.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.310
When that time arrives, by all means, reach out to me.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.980
"Solar Year 197"

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.230
This is the fire cathedral that will serve as our base.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.530
It's as run-down as you'd expect of the dwelling of a bunch of outcasts.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.160
So, are we the only two crewmen?

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.070
Oh, well...

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.370
Gathering crewmen I can trust is quite a difficult task.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.250
As it happens, I have a line on someone.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.420
A subordinate from my soldier days.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.630
Someone who works harder than anyone,

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.460
but who wasn't much use as a soldier.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.010
Who is more compassionate, and thinks of others before herself,

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.010
which makes her a good fit for your 8th.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.600
Huh?

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.680
Oh, yeah?

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.390
Way to go, Maki-san.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:22.480
Huh? I thought I was only brought in to be a meat shield because of my ability.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.570
Lieutenant, you said that?

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:33.450
I'm so happy... Lieutenant, nicely done.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.870
The heart of the 8th remains unchanged since its founding--

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.540
respect and prayers for the Infernals we put to rest,

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.710
deliverance from the flames for those who are alive,

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.180
and cherishing human lives.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.520
"Inquiry Report"

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.440
This is kind of turning into a long story,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.980
but this was the 8th's first fire scene.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.780
It was a hot day.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.070
It was our first call out, and we were all nervous.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:15.160
The victim who had Infernalized was dressed all in white.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.790
We put them to rest without incident,

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.130
but there were a lot of suspicious factors about that fire.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.710
An unfamiliar red cross...

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.260
No next of kin. The company where they worked

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.300
hurriedly came to collect their personal effects.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.010
Looking into it, that business still exists.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.970
It's located in Asakusa.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.560
That's the 7th's jurisdiction.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.560
--Come on by, come on by! We have Hoppy, cheap!

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.900
--Yo, Beni-chan! --Come on by, come on by! We have Hoppy, cheap!

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.280
--We have monjayaki, monja, and beer, too!

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.400
--Hello there, Waka, sir. --We have monjayaki, monja, and beer, too!

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.740
Benimaru-chan!

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.950
I made some daifuku. Take some with you.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.620
Huh? Don't I always say I don't like sweets, you old biddy?

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.920
She makes too much.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.970
Yo, Beni-chan! Haven't seen you in three days. You doing all right?

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.310
Come have a drink with me tonight!

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.520
Buzz off.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.740
Daifuku from the old biddy. Anyone who wants one, help yourself.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.660
I love that die-hard old hag's daifuku!

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.660
An old lady who can't make daifuku would be better off dead!

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.420
Hinata, Hikage... Now, look...

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.300
What is it, Waka? We aren't listening to any complaints.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.970
They're just parroting you, Waka.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.310
"Lieutenant" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Sagamiya Konro"

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.560
I'm not listening to any complaints.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.640
You see? Right there.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.190
These daifuku are delicious! The last glimmer of a die-hard old biddy.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.400
The light of a dying old hag is tasty!

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.990
I never said anything like that.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:16.910
By the way, Waka, we just got word from the folks at the 8th.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:21.540
They say they want to search our jurisdiction over that Evangelist matter.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.790
Too much trouble. Ignore them.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.210
Begging your pardon, but we're already here.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.710
Huh?

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.720
"Episode 11: The Mightiest Hikeshi"

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.640
What do you think you're doing barging your way in here?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.770
I heard that Captain Shinmon Benimaru hated the bother of formalities,

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.270
and we decided to just come over directly.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.150
So you've come here unannounced. Fine.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.320
And I don't care a bit about this Evangelist investigation,

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.500
but I can't have anyone coming in to disrupt my turf.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.420
The Evangelist is artificially producing Infernals.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.710
There's a possibility that the people of this area will be the next target.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.720
That's what the empire says, right?

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.720
It's not like I've ever actually seen one of them turn a person

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.310
into an Infernal, myself.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.810
I'm not so naive that I believe that.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.770
Well, I have seen it myself!

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:35.320
It doesn't matter to me what some imperial dog saw.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.780
I don't need to hear any tales from a credulous pup.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:44.330
And I don't need to hear that from some incredulous do-nothing.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.500
Captain of the 7th, sir, you're the mightiest Fire Soldier, aren't you?

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.800
So powerful that you forced the empire to acknowledge your town's hikeshi force?

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.260
Well now it's my turn to kick your ass and make you acknowledge me!

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.850
"Fires and fistfights are the flowers of Edo," huh?

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.860
Fire! Fire! Fire!

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.110
An Infernal?

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.820
You had to go and jinx us, Waka.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.950
Damn it.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.000
Beat it on out of here before I get back.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.630
That must be it.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:36.510
Who is it?

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.590
The ever-ostentatious Kantaro.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.640
He just barely invited me to have a drink with him.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.310
Kantaro over on Block 3 has turned Infernal!

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:56.490
Seiya! Soiya! Seiya! Soiya! Seiya! Soiya! Seiya!

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.240
What's he planning to do?

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.070
The festival is beginning!

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.040
Those homes!

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.430
He flew away.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.430
What kind of ability does their captain have?

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.640
There you are, you old coot!

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.020
--Waka! --Waka!

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.040
Another block!

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.580
We can rebuild houses as much as we need to.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:56.250
But now that Kantaro has become an Infernal, his life is over.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.470
What's going on? Is he starting fires and controlling the flames?

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.560
There may be a trick to those matoi he's using.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.560
Waka can use both third-generation pyrokinetic

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.480
and second-generation flame manipulation abilities.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.230
Creating fires and controlling them are a piece of cake for him.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.400
He's a compound Fire Soldier, unlike any other.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.910
"Compound Fire Soldier" "Shinmon Benimaru"

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.960
Look at this, Kantaro! The whole block is a mess!

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.290
You're much too old to be running around like this, you old coot!

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:46.100
This is just like you--always so ostentatious. Aren't you?

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.310
Way to hang in there.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:17.210
Thank you for letting me see Kantaro through to the end.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.750
Did Benimaru-chan's way of putting someone to rest

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.930
strike an 8th Fire Soldier like yourself as being too rough?

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.720
Just as the Holy Sol religion offers its prayers,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.060
we have our destroyed block offerings.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:35.810
Everyone in our world is terrified by the flames of Infernalization,

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.730
and are looking for a place to die.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.610
As far as the people here go, if we have to die anyway,

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:46.700
we want to have Benimaru-chan be the one putting us to rest.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:51.910
Shinmon Benimaru, the demolishing king of Asakusa.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.020
Too sweet.

"To be continued"

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:25.900
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.950
and curse the unwavering present,

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.080
but words that simply hang in the air

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.830
are not enough to save you

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.140
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.310
between sights we never reach

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.520
and pain that brings no warmth

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.650
to make it to a faraway place

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.900
Given the hope that you speak of

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.110
or the ideals that you dream of

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:13.870
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.120
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.080
and curse the unwavering present,

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.290
but words that simply hang in the air

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:29.880
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.930
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.140
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.270
I hope we can still walk together again

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.520
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.230
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.530
