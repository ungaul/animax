WEBVTT

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.760
A long time ago, mankind was touched by the planet's anger,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.680
and the world was engulfed in flames.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.390
It was the Day of the Cataclysm.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.020
The flames burned ferociously,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.560
with an intensity threatening to incinerate the places mankind lived,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.190
the languages they spoke, and the culture they had built up.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.450
This is a run-down kind of run-down.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.290
Lieutenant Karim, long time no see.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.580
What brings you here?

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.250
Tamaki, I'm pleased to see you in good health.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.880
We're here to compare notes, both now and moving forward.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.760
We figured we should start working together.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.890
Am I really going to have to fight the White-Clad... and Sho?

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.850
Hey, stop spacing off over there.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.890
--Wah! Put me down, you idiot! --Um... How did...?!

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.480
No touching me there!

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.570
Maybe you aren't my beloved steed Silver, the partner I've been looking for,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.910
but even now, you're still my partner. Isn't that right, Sil-burro?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.790
Please stop hanging weird stuff on the walls.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.830
This is my Pegasus, who via Vulcan descended to earth

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.130
and made possible my miraculous recovery.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.840
It's a donkey.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.710
Are you okay with this, Lieutenant?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.880
"Moosifer"
Arthur, get back to work.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.880
That hat came from Vulcan, didn't it, sir?

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.680
I saw it here this morning.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.850
Don't those horns get in the way?

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.730
They don't impede my work.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.440
Lieutenant, you're much too cavalier about fashion.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.690
Would you like me to buy you something sometime?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.980
I wouldn't trust you to buy anything that didn't come out of a fairy tale.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.990
Huh? It would be better than those horns, sir.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.570
Come on, enough idle chatter.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.330
That looks like impedance.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.000
"Moosifer"

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.060
Nee-chan, sorry to trouble you.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.680
Roger wilco, sir.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680
Hmm?

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.940
Hey, Obi!

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.320
I know you're not using Iris as your tea girl, right?

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.690
Nee-san, I offered to do this.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.110
But never mind that...

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.570
What are you sitting up there for?

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.620
I don't appreciate being made to sit on the same level as 1st gravel.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.040
Would you prefer I sit on the floor, instead?

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.420
Ah, yes, please do so.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.840
What's the matter? Get sitting, already.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.640
Crap. I only meant it as a little joke.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.930
All right, let's jump in and get this meeting started.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.230
Let's share the information that each of us has obtained so far,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.900
and figure out any leads and plans we have for the Evangelist going forward.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.030
We just barely started believing the White-Clad even existed not long ago.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.410
I'm here on behalf of Beni, but we don't have much information yet.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.120
There are cases of human combustion being carried out by the White-Clad

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.250
along with all the other cases that are taking place now.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.210
The reason Rekka Hoshimiya was using bugs to create man-made Infernals

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.800
was to find those that he said were "compatible" to the flames.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.590
Perhaps they aren't just making Infernals,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.140
but instead are trying to find some special ability.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.480
Dr. Giovanni was apparently after the "key" to Amaterasu.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.360
Do they have some kind of designs on Amaterasu?

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:27.240
"Company 3 captain imposter arrested on assault charge"

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.610
The attack on Vulcan is being reported as being committed

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.740
by an imposter wearing a mask like Dr. Giovanni's.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.370
But this one's the imposter.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.000
Haijima was probably afraid of their own Company 3 being scandalized,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.250
and arranged for a fall guy.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.420
Vulcan, who has actually seen Giovanni's face,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.710
said for a fact the man at the press conference wasn't him.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.260
The 3rd has apparently had a number of people leaving it.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.840
Probably spies that were embedded there.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.220
They're likely back with the Evangelist by now.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.770
I'm not sure if all of Haijima is against us,

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.060
but the 3rd, under Haijima's control, is working beyond the empire's oversight.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.650
The White-Clad's actions are only going to get even more radical.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.610
If we don't know the full scope of the enemy,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.110
we should find their base and hit them.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.450
My man Licht has already started looking into their base.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.750
You, a member of the Special Fire Force, huh?

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.130
There's nothing so unusual about that, right? We're champions of justice.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.510
You can tell where the base is from just that?

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.980
From just this? No.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.100
Can you trust Licht?

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.820
So far, he's done well by us.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.990
The 8th's objective is to pinpoint where the Evangelist is, and move in.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.990
Do you have a plan for moving in, you musclebound 8th gorilla?

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.080
Can the 8th's rookies fight?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.920
Even if you do find out where they are, you can't beat them.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.760
Are they really that bad?

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.930
You have no idea.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.930
The ability their commander, Sho, has

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.270
probably comes from a Link with the Evangelist.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.230
An Adolla Link...

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.980
What do you think the 8th needs?

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.400
The 8th's rookies are outstanding.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.570
I can vouch for the strength and quality of their abilities.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.610
However, they do lack experience.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.780
Especially when it comes to hand-to-hand combat.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.490
When they sparred at the 1st earlier,

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.330
they struck me as being hasty and inexperienced.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.830
Their abilities may be competent and effective,

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.000
but they're lacking in actual combat.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.090
Combat, huh? We have someone who does nothing but combat.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.260
Want us to look after them?

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.100
Can you use that genius brain of yours

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.180
to come up with a plan to improve the Devil's flames?

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.310
I'll give it some thought.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.610
But you catching up to Commander Sho will depend on him.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.610
Yeah, what's up, Konro?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.910
Huh? Why do I have to look after them?!

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.290
What? I owe them? Yeah, I do owe them.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.920
"Episode 18: The Secrets of Pyrokinesis"

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.010
Excuse me! It's Shinra, from the 8th!

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.640
C-Captain Shinmon...?

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.810
If this was combat, you'd be dead.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.190
Okay, step right up!

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:53.700
You're here to have me train you, right? Don't let your guard down.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.610
Dimwit.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.070
I told you, don't let your guard down.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.620
Dimwit.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.080
Ha!

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.460
Iron-madillo, the Magnetic Extinguishing Ball.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.920
How is it used?

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.760
Oh, just watch.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:21.810
It hits the flames with powerful magnetism, extinguishing them in an instant.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.600
That's amazing. That will be handy for someone like me, who's unpowered.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.480
Shinra and Arthur are off getting special training in Asakusa, right?

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.190
I don't want to be outdone, so I'm inventing some clever stuff.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.540
You aren't relaxing, are you? There are no rules in combat.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.420
You never know when something might happen.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.800
Is it exhausting?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.340
Y-Yes, sir.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.890
That's because your life isn't at stake.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.720
It's the tension itself you're feeling that gets you worked up.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.060
On the battlefield, feel life, instead.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.690
Your own life, your friends' lives, the other side's lives.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.280
When you're aware of all those lives, the tension won't get you so worked up.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.030
You're saying to treasure life, then.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.740
When you're feeling life, it becomes harder to leave yourself vulnerable.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.500
Now, on with the training. Come at me like I'm out for your lives.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.960
Oh, they're going at it.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.470
--They're going at it! --They're going at it!

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.560
That's enough.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560
Already?

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.310
Your aptitude is okay, but you're not about to hit me.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.270
Your attacks have no element of surprise. You're lacking something.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.070
Lacking something?

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.740
Do you know what that is?

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.320
A finishing move.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.780
A finishing move--

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.500
I told you not to let you guard down!

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.670
Devise a finishing move that capitalizes on your speed advantage.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.500
Leave it to you, Captain Shinmon. You're the best at noticing these things.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.460
Huh?

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.220
Oh, hello there.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:24.850
I'm Company 8's gate-crashing forensic science team, Viktor Licht.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.560
I've thought up a way to power-up Shinra.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.400
Captain Shinmon, can I ask you for your assistance?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.020
What do you mean?

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.690
Put simply, jet propulsion.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:43.200
Converging flames into one direction will increase propulsive force.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.870
By compressing the emitted flame, burst firepower can be increased.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.170
In other words, focus one's flame tighter, right?

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.580
Yes indeed.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.500
Is this much firepower enough?

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.050
Yes indeed!

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.390
Awesome!

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.940
Right now, Shinra-kun, your flames wastefully spread out in many directions.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.150
By simply consolidating them, your thrust will increase that much.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.320
If you can condense your flames in one direction, like Captain Shinmon did,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.330
you should be able to produce more speed than you currently do.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.960
If I can do that, I'll have my finishing move.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.260
Shinra, keep practicing nothing but your finishing move.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.180
Sir!

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.930
Arthur, your ability is your finishing move.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.770
Spar with me and let's train your fundamentals.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.140
Come at me like you mean to kill me.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.100
Hmph.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.190
Well now, let's see how this goes.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.900
Buddy, you don't seem like the others from the 8th.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.200
So it's true that you came from Haijima, then.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.370
My noggin is too sharp to be at the 8th, is that it?

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.370
If you try anything funny with the 8th, I'll toss you into the ocean.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.170
Of course I'm not going to. Good grief.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.350
I use my toes to fine-tune my attitude control,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.360
so if I don't move them just right, I lose my balance.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.450
On the other hand, there's no point in me pulling faces.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.330
Thinking about something I haven't done is a waste of time.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.330
I just need to keep trying.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.920
He's clever. Just about all problems can be settled by saying,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.500
"Whatever, just do it," or "Time to give up."

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.260
That's pretty simplistic for a clever scientist like yourself.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.760
You first have to stand at the starting line

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.350
before you even realize what the real problem you should be thinking about is.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:18.270
Not knowing what the problem is before trying it is what makes a problem hard.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.650
In that regard, you're a lot like us tough punks.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.490
How does Captain Shinmon control his flames so skillfully?

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.910
There must be some hint in there somewhere.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.980
How many times must I tell you that Fire Soldiers do not play with fire,

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.980
First Class Fire Soldier Maki Oze?

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.310
It's not like that, sir!

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.030
Sputter and Flare have an important mission this time!

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.610
Has being caught up in fairy tales finally driven you crazy?

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.740
It's okay, Lieutenant.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.830
I've created some new equipment for Maki-san that uses Sputter and Flare.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.120
Hmm?

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.250
The Twin Hover Units, "Tekkyo."

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.540
"Twin Hover Units Tekkyo"

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.300
They're powered by Sputter and Flare.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.840
They're weapons controlled by Maki-san's second-generation abilities.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.510
What do they do?

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.140
They're flying hammers, I guess you'd call them.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.520
They can launch physical attacks against enemies with powers,

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.270
who are resistant to flames.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.230
What do you think?

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.820
The flight test went perfectly.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.950
Then the Sput-Flare-Witch is finished.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.240
It's not "Sput-Flare-Witch," it's "Tekkyo."

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.960
A long time ago, mankind was touched by the planet's anger,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.750
and the world was engulfed in flames.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.130
It was the Day of the Cataclysm.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.710
The flames burned ferociously,

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.760
with an intensity threatening to incinerate the places mankind lived,

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:15.050
"Pass or else"
the languages they spoke, and the culture they had built up.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:22.190
Pinch... Pinch... Take the big blast of flames and squeeze...

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:27.360
Squeeze... Squeeze...!

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.400
You haven't changed a thing!

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.450
Nothing but your silly face, you idiot!

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.780
Huh? Was I really making a face?

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.990
A disgraceful one.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.160
A gross, ugly sourpuss.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.450
This way doesn't work, either.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.460
Captain Obi does this one a lot.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.290
Rock &amp; Roll!

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.180
What was that? Did his feet just rip a huge fart?

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.850
Don't divert your attention!

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.020
When you exploit an opening, be quiet about it.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.860
Still, that wasn't bad.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.110
Arthur... Shinra, try that one more time.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.450
When you put your force behind your flames, sir,

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.870
you always do this with your hands,

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.200
so I've been trying to do the same with different forms.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.040
That was one that Captain Obi often does...

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.960
Wah!

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.720
Huh?

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.220
It's hard to see what you're doing. Take off your gloves.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.300
Yes, sir.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.430
In old proto-national martial arts, there are what are called tenokata.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:48.230
The thing I do with my index and middle fingers is one of them.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.360
I use this form to control my flames.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.610
"Tiger Claw" "Pickaxe Fist" "Mantis Hand"

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.650
There are a number of different tenokata, each with different effects.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.450
"Bear Paw" "Crescent Moon Hand"

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.910
"Tiger Crush"
One of them is called Tora Hishigi, a form which increases foot power.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.120
Place your index finger over the base of your thumb,

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.500
and place your thumb under the base of your pinky finger.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.590
Making the form with your fingers

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.210
concentrates the flow of ki in your body to one spot.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.180
This also affects your flames.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.180
Control my ki with my fingers...?

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.470
You can figure the rest out from there.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.350
Thank you very much, sir!

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:30.310
How long are you going to lie there? Let's keep going.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.480
Huh? Oh.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.360
Turn my index finger and thumb inward...

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.200
...and direct the flow of my ki into my feet.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.420
Whoa!

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.170
That sensation--it was like my flames were being compressed,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.920
and my body was about to be blasted upward!

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.260
Tora Hishigi is awesome!

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:07.270
The flow of my body's ki... I'm starting to get a handle on my flames!

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.560
This time, I'm going to shoot right up!

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.900
I feel the heat in my feet...

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.910
My tenokata... ...links to my feet...

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:29.910
I can get there faster... I can get to Sho faster...

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.250
Faster!

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.680
That's fast.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.640
I guess this is why Joker sees so much promise in him.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.600
Not bad at all.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.270
--Damn it... --I'll give you credit for attacking quietly.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.110
Shinra! Use that to come after me now!

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.700
Waka was dreading this at first, but I'm glad he's having fun now.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.030
You mean that? He looks awfully unhappy to me.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.500
Someone who's worth training has stopped by.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.460
I'm sure Waka must be ecstatic.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.210
A knight... does not lose...

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:24.760
It looks like he's getting worn out. Why don't we call it a day?

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.430
You took a pretty good beating. Are you okay?

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.850
Yeah. I'm a knight after all.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.900
Shinra, have you come up with a name for your finishing move yet?

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.440
Oh, right! My finishing move!

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.190
--Don't drop your guard-- --Whoa!

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.610
So, what do you call your move?

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:44.570
Kicker-Man Kick!

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:45.740
Overruled.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.760
Well, how are they doing?

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.640
They're still just a couple of kids.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.400
Too shaky for their own good.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.580
Your proto-national sword training is starting to take shape.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.290
This single-edged blade moves differently than your omnidirectional one,

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.170
but you'll have more avenues of attack.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.090
There's no harm in learning it.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:54.890
Good, that was well done. If I hadn't known about it, you would have hit me.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.560
Use it well.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.150
Yes, sir!

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:02.730
I heard about your brother. He's the only family you have.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.400
Make sure to keep him safe.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.990
Thank you very much, sir!

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.820
Just sit tight.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.040
"To be continued"

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.510
"Next time"

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.010
"Episode 19: Into the Nether"
