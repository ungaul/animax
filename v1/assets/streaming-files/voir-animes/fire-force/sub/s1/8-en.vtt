00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.630
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.300
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.910
Yes. The evangelism is proceeding smoothly.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.990
There may be some slight obstacles, but it will not be a problem.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.870
Infernalization will move forward without a hitch.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.960
Very well then, Evangelist...

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.000
Látom.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.430
The core remains of sample "Infernal A"

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.060
showed different characteristics compared to those of "Infernal B."

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.810
After analyzing them, soot and DNA from a creature other than the victim

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.860
were identified in the core.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.030
You concluded that it was insect genetic data.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.490
Those are conclusive experimental results, arrived at through my research.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.740
I've investigated many Infernals,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.660
and the samples that I believe were artificially created

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.830
all had the same thing in common.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.460
All of the samples had traces of some kind of creature

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.590
entering the core from the outside.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.180
Insects.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.010
"Episode 8: Infernal Insects"

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.890
The darkness is illuminated

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.520
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.230
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.650
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.360
The end is illuminated

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.910
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.660
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.040
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.920
Flames rise to show us the way

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.590
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.010
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.270
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.980
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.820
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.870
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.410
Playthings that make sounds

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.120
and magic that chases pain away

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.210
are all precious treasures to me

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.840
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.760
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.600
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.490
It's been five days since we joined the 1st.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.200
Our investigation is to last a month.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.830
We have to find leads on artificial Infernals within that month.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.460
Whoa, Lieutenant, what are you doing?

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.140
Are you all right? Any problems? Is Arthur doing all right?

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.560
I told you, we're fine, sir! Please don't come by every morning.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.350
My, if it isn't the lieutenant from the 8th.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.150
Hard at work again today, I see.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.820
Hello.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.280
He certainly is concerned about his men, isn't he?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.690
He really is.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.780
Jeez, this is getting embarrassing! Please leave!

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.490
Hmm? What's come over you all of a sudden?

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.500
You should check in with the captain more often. He's concerned.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.290
Yes, all right.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.580
Shoo! Shoo!

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.090
Yikes, Captain Hibana is here, too.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.090
They have us, here from other companies, prowling around,

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.140
and they aren't acting like they're on guard.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.520
At the 5th, with all of Haijima's trade secrets,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.940
you'd never see everyone behaving this openly.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.560
According to my investigation, artificial Infernals appear primarily

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.520
in security zones, where only Fire Soldiers can enter,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.990
and in fire sites that have been closed off.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.950
Much as it disturbs me,

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.330
chances are high that a Special Fire Soldier is the culprit.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.750
But is the culprit here at the 1st...?

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.840
U-Um, why did all of you become Fire Soldiers?

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.140
Why, to be a hero, protecting everyone from human combustion and Infernals!

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.390
It's only natural that a knight would fight on behalf of the weak.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.980
Well, I'm a third generation, and as a Fire Soldier, I'd be in with the ladies.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.150
You're all so great.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.740
I can't really use my pyrokinesis very well.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.990
Nor do I have any grand objective like the rest of you.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.250
Forget about the objective.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.580
As long as we end up helping others, that's enough, isn't it?

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.380
Yeah, I guess so. Thanks, Shinra-kun.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.760
How long are you going to sit around eating?! Time for morning assembly!

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.100
Everyone, hurry back to your appointed stations and--

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.390
--Sorry. I was reaching for the mayonnaise, and you... --What the hell are you doing, sicko?!

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.230
Whoa, hey!

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.690
You jerk! You stay away from me-ow!

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.900
Could you knock off your lucky lechery?

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.200
Is that morning assembly?

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.240
That's the alarm! An Infernal has appeared!

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.330
Juggernaut, report to Lieutenant Hoshimiya!

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.870
Kishiri, Lieutenant Li!

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.710
You two from the 8th, report to Lieutenant Flam!

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.690
There are five victims who Infernalized.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.350
This appears to be another multiple incident.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.860
Nozaka Squad, make sure the civilians are all evacuated.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.110
Matsuda Squad, you'll gather information and report it to everyone.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.070
The rest of us will look for the Infernals.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.870
Let's put them to rest quickly!

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.120
--Yes, sir! --Yes, sir!

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.370
Awesome. This is one swift, take-charge company.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.630
You two from the 8th, stand by here with Matsuda Squad.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.960
But we can help, too!

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.090
Our leadership structure would be thrown off by newcomers.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.130
Keep on keeping yourselves here.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.660
Are you all right, sir?

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.080
What happened?

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.590
There they are!

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.430
After them!

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.390
What about the Infernal?

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.100
Right now, we'll just have to let the 1st handle him.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.810
You'll pay for this.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.610
Fire Soldiers are supposed to protect citizens!

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.400
Don't think that you can escape my feet!

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.910
Shinra!

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.080
What are you doing? I thought I ordered you to stand down.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.130
What have you been doing back here?

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.210
I will--

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.340
--We don't get to Shinjuku very much, so we got lost. --What the hell are you doing...?

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.770
Lieutenant Rekka, laying to rest has been completed.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.230
Tamaki, good work.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.530
All right, we're heading back.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.530
Hey, why did you stop me?

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.880
Aren't those lieutenants our artificial Infernal suspects?

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.850
We still don't know who the enemy is, and who our allies are.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.890
We could have been eliminated right there on the spot.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.060
Then what are you planning to do? You saw what happened.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.110
Yeah. I definitely saw it.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.740
He pressed a bottle containing an insect against that civilian's back.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.200
Immediately afterward... ...they Infernalized.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.790
This is the worst. How can a Fire Soldier be creating Infernals?

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.540
The person you saw wearing those robes

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.710
was only one of three lieutenants from the 1st.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.960
We'll have to start by investigating Karim and Rekka.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.880
You sure are enthusiastic. These guys are formidable foes.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.890
Of course I am. I don't care who they are, they have to pay.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.770
First thing we check is Karim's room.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.270
He's not there right now?

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.230
I told Juggernaut to come up with some excuse to keep him occupied.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.690
Have you told him about our mission?

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.860
No.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.200
He seems to have taken a liking to Tamaki,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.780
and when I told him I'd get her number for him,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.740
he was only too happy to cooperate.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.330
Never mind him, though, why are you dressed like that?

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.290
I made a job change, from knight to assassin.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.970
After carrying on about being a knight for so long, you just...?

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.430
I'm a knight.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.930
"Karim Flam"      "Out"

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.940
Hey!

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.570
Mini Excalibur. I made it from a sheet of plastic,

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.030
so it can only be used once.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.990
You dumbass! This will leave evidence that someone broke in!

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.030
That doesn't sound like you.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.490
What, did you lose your nerve after Burns beat you, you wuss?

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.660
Huh?

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.250
If solving the mystery of human combustion could be done cleanly,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.000
it would have been solved a long time ago.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.590
Hmph, say what you want, but you're not gonna solve it.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.820
That's it!

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.200
You can make an Infernal with one of these?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.540
That clinches it. Karim Flam is our culprit.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.460
I left that insect-like insect there on purpose.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:03.130
Your behavior in the back alley was abnormal, so I thought I'd test you.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.390
Looks like the 8th is here pursuing that insect-like insect, too.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.020
What are you talking about?

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.690
I'm out to get the owner of that insect, too.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.440
Oh, so you're on our side.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.400
How can we trust you?

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.700
You saw the culprit, right? The fact that you narrowed your suspicions on me

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.120
means they were wearing robes like this.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.040
Isn't that right?

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.120
There was one other man there at that moment wearing robes like mine.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.670
Rekka Hoshimiya.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.760
There was an incident two months ago

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.760
where a group of children collectively caught fire. It was far too unnatural.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.020
It was then that I found the insect.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.640
Children were burned?

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.530
I got a five-star from the gacha machine.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.690
Oh, yeah! No fair!

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.320
Hey, you two...

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.450
Fires sure are scary, huh?

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.160
You heard about that incident where children your age burned up, right?

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.120
There's a way to make sure the flames don't get you.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.290
Why don't you come with me?

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.440
What are you doing?

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.750
"No trespassing"

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.660
Okay, let's go!

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.040
Tamaki, thanks for rounding them up.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.090
I finally found a sacred prayer to protect against Infernalization.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:11.970
If we can save the children from the flame threat, I can die happy!

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.140
Lieutenant...

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:19.440
I want to save even more, but I'm much too wretched! Curses!

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.070
Um, Father, will they really not become Infernals?

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.070
Yes! But you haven't told anyone, because we don't want squabbling, right?

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:33.530
Yu-kun at my cram school burned up. I don't want that to happen.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.830
If I do what you say, I won't ever burn up, right?

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.330
Of course you won't.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.130
Everyone, now that I'm here, everything will be all right.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.550
You'll be mighty people, who can't be beaten by flames!

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:54.970
Tamaki, would you mind stepping outside? I'd like to focus on the prayer.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.180
Huh?

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.730
Thanks for all the help you've been.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.480
I'd like to see the prayer, too, sir.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.980
I would do anything for you, Lieutenant Rekka.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.400
My stars!

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.400
Thank you, Tamaki!

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.990
You're really making too much of it, sir...

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:18.410
Tamaki! I'm so grateful!

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.630
All righty!

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.670
Now...

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:32.890
...to find someone suitable for the pilot light. You all have been chosen.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.470
W-We've changed our minds!

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.430
We can't have that. You would destroy your own child's future?

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.350
What a poor mother you are.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.480
Mom...

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.700
Return to the great flame of fire.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.010
You're going to go look for Rekka, right? We're coming with you.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:13.430
This is the 1st's problem. You two keep out of it.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.800
We are currently assigned to Karim Squad, sir.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.930
Then your squad's lieutenant is ordering you to stay out of this.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:25.730
We have no intention of following that order. We're not even formal members.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.570
Hmph, so you're like men who are my men, but aren't my men, then?

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.280
How freeing for you.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.370
Feel free to feel free, then.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:51.340
Well, that didn't work. I just wish there was someone here who was suitable.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.510
Stop crying! You won't ever get strong that way!

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.470
You can't be afraid of the flames! You want to get stronger!

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.810
Right? Isn't that what you want?

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.900
Lieutenant Rekka, what on earth...?

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.820
I was going to let you live to take the blame,

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.990
so I must not have squeezed hard enough.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.280
Huh? What do you mean, sir?

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:23.450
You are the only one who can accept my passion and fervor, Tamaki!

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.160
This isn't happening, right?

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:30.170
Lieutenant Rekka, are you the one who has been creating Infernals?

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.760
I respected you so much, sir!

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.840
You respect me, don't you?

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.270
Or do you let your feelings change as easily as that?!

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:49.360
I'm not giving up! No matter how many innocent children must be sacrificed,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.980
I won't give up! Not ever!

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.700
I will create Infernals for the Evangelist,

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.070
until the day when I find someone suitable for the pilot light!

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.580
You were a hot-blooded guy who was awkward

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:10.580
but never let it get you down. I always found that to be cool about you.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:16.010
But you were just a hot-blooded son of a bitch, weren't you?!

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.090
My stars!

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.850
Lie there and be quiet.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.440
Now, for the pilot light... --No! Stop! No!

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.320
--Tak-kun! --No! Stop! No!

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.860
Here you go, Tak-kun. It's all right.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.410
Tak-kun!

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.760
Must be my imagination...

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:03.010
Hang in there! I know you can accept the flames!

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.310
Stop...!

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.220
Hang in there, Tak-kun! Fight!

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.810
Fight, Tak-kun!

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.580
He isn't becoming an Infernal?

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.660
He's compatible.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.540
I did it! I finally found someone compatible for the pilot light!

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.880
There are still four of you children left.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.340
You haven't been spared yet,

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.010
so take on the pilot light and earn victory for tomorrow!

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:52.900
Charge it up, charge it up, fight! Don't let it beat you! Fire!

00:19:52.900 --> 00:20:01.400
Please... stop, already... Somebody... I'm begging you...

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.200
Somebody help!

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.580
What are you doing, Tamaki?

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.260
I thought you were an outstanding, obedient subordinate!

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.100
What are you doing, Tamaki?!

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.890
There are children watching! You shouldn't be like this!

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.440
The children are trying so hard!

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.570
You were supposed to take the fall for this crime!

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.570
What's become of you, Tamaki?!

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.860
I used to like you.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.030
I figured you were the only one who could do it!

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.410
I'm going to have to change the plan and kill you.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.790
The hot-blooded, gentle lieutenant...

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.960
I'll make it look like you burned yourself to death!

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.840
Curses! I had faith that you could do this! This is hard on me, too!

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.600
My fist is weeping over this!

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.770
I will stand by and see your end through!

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.850
You're going to die in my place, Tamaki!

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:16.980
--Stop, Lieutenant Rekka...

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.730
--I looked up to you. --Stop, Lieutenant Rekka...

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.440
Help me...

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.310
Are you okay, Tamaki?

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.000
"To be continued"

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.880
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.930
and curse the unwavering present,

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.050
but words that simply hang in the air

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.810
are not enough to save you

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.120
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.290
between sights we never reach

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.500
and pain that brings no warmth

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.630
to make it to a faraway place

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.880
Given the hope that you speak of

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.090
or the ideals that you dream of

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:13.850
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.100
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.060
and curse the unwavering present,

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.270
but words that simply hang in the air

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:29.860
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.910
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.120
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.250
I hope we can still walk together again

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.460
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.170
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:53.470
"Next time"

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.970
