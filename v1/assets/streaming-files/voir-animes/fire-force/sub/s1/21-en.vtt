00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.160
Lisa...

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.800
There's no way you two, who are unpowered, can beat us.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.760
Lisa-san! Don't do this!

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.390
Here in this world, where human combustion is rampant,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.980
you who are unpowered and unable to cope with it have no choice but to die.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.770
However, Lisa's power has been kindled within her.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.070
Thanks to her compatibility with the bugs.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.410
My parents died in a fire caused by an Infernal.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.530
Ever since then, I feared the flames,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.370
but thanks to the bugs, my eyes were opened, and the fear disappeared.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.540
Lisa, you're being fooled!

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.290
Just like you before, I don't have any powers.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.880
As a Fire Soldier, carrying out my duties, I, too, experience the terror of the flames.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.970
Dr. Giovanni is only preying on your vulnerability to take advantage of you!

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.850
You can say that to her with your ax in hand?

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.900
I'm directing that at you!

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.780
Stop this, Lisa-san! There's no reason to protect him!

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.400
These tentacles that envelop me react to magnetism,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.410
and automatically defend me.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.450
The flames that I once feared are now something that protect me.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.870
What kind of bug did this to you, Lisa?!

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.380
Would you like to know?

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.710
I'm not telling you!

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.880
You're both going to die in ignorance!

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.390
You are one aggravating old coot!

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.770
Did you think you could put out my flames with a fire extinguisher?!

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.480
That won't work, Captain!

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.860
Yeah, we'll see!

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.070
Are you just messing with me now?

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.320
No, I'm not messing with you.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.240
I'm trying my hardest to rescue you from the flames holding you captive!

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.200
I am not captive!

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.620
Then tell me, why do you look so anxious?

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.170
I am not anxious!

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.130
Putting out fires is our job.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.890
You brought something as useless as a fire extinguisher to the battlefield?

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.020
What a foolish man you are.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.810
You used to be a Fire Soldier, right? You know how dangerous a scene can be.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.030
The motto of a Fire Soldier is to protect lives and property!

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.700
Rescue equipment is never useless!

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.370
Kill them.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.080
Y-Yes, sir.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.790
Your compassion is going to cost you your life.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.750
Your desire to save lives is pointless if you lose your own life.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.720
The last thing I'd do is treat my life carelessly.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.970
I've been setting things up to save you, Lisa-san. Sorry to keep you.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.060
Obi!

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.810
You pretended to get beaten up by her

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.150
so you could put extinguisher grenades on each of her tentacles?!

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.240
I'm falling...!

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.370
I don't have anything left... Dad... Mom...

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.220
Vulcan!

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.070
I don't think you get it, Feeler!

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.540
Feeler!

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.580
Who was it that saved you from the flame terror?

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.000
I'm the one who allowed you to stay together with Vulcan.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.510
I know you haven't forgotten how indebted you are to me.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.220
Come back.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.510
Lisa!

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.350
It's no use.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.890
Dr. Giovanni is the one who gave to me when I lost everything.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.600
I can't turn against him.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.030
Just leave me alone, okay?

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.320
Giovanni!

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.870
Don't move. I will burn through her neck with this heating wire.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.290
Stop!

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:46.380
Vulcan, if you want to save this girl, you will do as I say.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.680
Take that gun and shoot Obi with it.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.930
Just how rotten are you?!

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.470
Rejoice, Feeler.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.730
Right now, your life is being put to use to serve the Evangelist.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.110
Isn't that what you want?

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.780
Vulcan, do as he says.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.830
I'm sorry.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.960
Hold your head up.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.170
Now, shoot him. You're out of time.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.340
You can make a big production, but it comes down to you shooting him or not.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.420
If you shoot him, Feeler lives;

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.010
if you don't, Lisa dies.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.140
That's all there is to it.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.600
I swear I'm gonna kill you!

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.470
You are?

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.940
Then you can watch as this heating wire sends the girl's head flying.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.070
Shoot me, Vulcan! Shoot me and save Lisa-san!

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.570
I can't!

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.490
Then Lisa is finished.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.160
Shoot me, Vulcan! Lisa-san will be killed!

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.250
Yeah, but...

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.750
Damn it!

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.730
You'd shoot your superior to protect your girl, Vulcan?

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.940
Lisa... Captain...

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.490
Damn that's terrifying, even knowing it's coming!

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.830
Turnout coats aren't supposed to be bulletproof.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.750
You had something rigged up over your chest.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.720
Would you like to know? Hmm? Giovanni? Hmm?

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.140
--It's an anti-physical-attack vest! --I'm not telling!

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.690
Aww... I am the 8th's engineer!

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.270
There's no way I'm letting my captain go out unprotected!

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.690
And that's why you did something that rash.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.860
We trust each other at the 8th, which makes us a team.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.700
Trust is a ridiculous, inexplicable concept!

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.700
What kind of disordered hardware is that?!

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.170
If the old man saw those, he'd be disgusted.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.500
Penguin-met, equip!

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.130
I'm going to give your machinery a strength test!

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.980
You make some weak hardware, don't you?

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.320
Lisa!

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.950
Lisa... Nice! Way to go!

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.620
Pretty smooth work for an unpowered.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.500
You started out as a Fire Soldier!

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.040
How does someone who protects the people from the flames

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.460
end up giving rise to man-made Infernals?!

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.010
What is this Evangelist you speak of after to be doing such a thing?!

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.680
You said that the motto you Fire Soldiers have

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.980
is to protect lives and property, didn't you?

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.060
Don't you realize how trivial that is?

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.650
Take a broader look at the world.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:37.110
People are just a small portion of the energy in it.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:42.160
Let stunted humanity burn, and become a part of this world!

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.030
That's a load of crap!

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:50.460
Around 250 years ago, the planet faced the Day of the Cataclysm.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.590
The cause of it was the release of a massive Adolla Burst.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:03.510
Further, the source of the Adolla Burst is a place you already believe in.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.180
Long before the Solar calendar began,

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.980
before even the Great Cataclysm, since time immemorial,

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.980
mankind has lived in fear of it.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.650
Regardless of what causes human combustion, it's our job to stop it.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.160
There isn't a good reason to set people ablaze!

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.330
Spontaneous human combustion is in keeping with natural law.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.000
Do you intend to defy the natural order?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.080
Your own bugs are unnatural!

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.760
Do you think the Evangelist to be a common person such as yourselves?

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.970
Whoever or whatever the Evangelist may be,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:52.060
they're nothing more than an idol you heretics have propped up to worship!

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:58.190
Honestly. What a ridiculous notion. An idol we worship?

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.990
Then what does that make the great Sol of the Holy Sol Temple?

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.160
What is the meaning in offering prayers that you don't know will be answered

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.870
to a god that you don't know exists?

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.370
Say what you will, but the Holy Sol Temple doesn't burn people!

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.880
The Evangelist is no idol.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:22.880
An unpowered such as yourself could not comprehend the Evangelist.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:28.430
Though Shinra Kusakabe may be starting to get an inkling.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.980
"Episode 21: Those Connected"

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.660
Shinra-kun? Are you all right?

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.270
Where is... this place...?

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.950
Who... are you...?

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.080
Shinra!

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.390
Sho...

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.410
Shinra-kun!

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.210
Are you okay, Shinra-kun?

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.670
What... did I...?

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.340
"Devil's Footprints."

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.390
What's the matter? Do you see something?

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.360
He's there, up ahead-- Sho.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.360
Right about now,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:53.990
Shinra Kusakabe's Adolla Burst should be starting to Link with Commander Sho.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.710
Link? What is it he's connecting with?

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.000
What is an Adolla Burst?!

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.130
An Adolla Burst is a special flame that can affect all other heat.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.550
It's the next step beyond a pyrokinetic,

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.880
as well as the pilot light behind human combustion.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.100
Then what are those bugs?!

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.850
Why do you use them as pilot lights to trigger human combustion?!

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.980
The connection between bugs and flames?

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.270
It's often said that the biology of insects evolved down a different path

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.280
than the other creatures of the earth, right?

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.400
So then, where did bugs come from?

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.620
What if they come from the same place that Adolla Bursts originate?

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.200
"Like moths to a flame."

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.790
What if that behavior is them trying to return to their mother flames?

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.060
So, you came after all... Shinra Kusakabe.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.600
Yeah! I'm here, just like I promised!

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.770
Promised? Promised to whom?

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:08.150
To our mom, Sho.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:13.280
I don't have a mother. The only mother figure I have is the Evangelist.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.870
Just thinking that you and I might be brothers turns my stomach.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.790
I have no recollection of being born from that filthy belly.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.850
Don't speak ill of Mom.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.810
Two bearers of an Adolla Burst, right before my eyes!

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.810
Fantastic!

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.080
You're not in the mood for a friendly chat, then?

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.100
Are you able to see this, too?

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.850
What just happened? It was like he stopped time.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.440
How could he do that with pyrokinesis?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.710
Captain!

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.000
--Lieutenant Hinawa!

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.460
--Maki! --Lieutenant Hinawa!

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.840
Captain!

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.880
The lesson is over.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:23.220
My task was to get Commander Sho and Shinra Kusakabe together.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:28.180
Now that it has been accomplished, I have no need to buy any more time.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.730
All by the grace of the Evangelist.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.020
Hold it!

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:40.530
Adolla Bursts are the cause of human combustion?

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.870
What the hell is happening to the world?

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.620
You think you can just run away?!

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.960
I'll leave Lisa here. But you will not reverse her brainwashing.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.210
Please wait... Please don't leave me behind...

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:05.390
Lisa... Brainwashing... Religion... Faith...

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.640
They're like a curse to people.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.230
Bye, now.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:21.240
However quickly you may be able to move, you can never catch up to me.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.120
The universes in which we exist are different.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.580
Universes?

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.120
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.080
We live in different universes? Is that why you're telling me to give up?

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.050
I'm taking you with me, even if I have to drag you along!

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.030
What is that steam?

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.740
What, have you been bewitched by a fox?

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.370
Universes... time... freezing...

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:16.290
If he's engaging enough heat to expand the universe...

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.000
I-It can't be...!

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.260
Even if he is a third generation, can a person do such a thing?!

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.600
Shinra-kun, let's get out of here! He's too much for you! You can't win!

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.020
Commander Sho is...!

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.890
Huh? What exactly is Sho doing?

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:40.480
No matter how fast you are, it is meaningless against me.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.780
I can control my own universe.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.780
Your own universe? What the hell does that mean?

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.120
Another Adolla Link?

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.920
You will never understand it if I explain it in words.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:07.010
"To be continued"

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:15.100
Look at the imaginations in my head and I'll go back to myself

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:22.110
Forcing right decisions on me is like a devil that eats me up

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.910
He that used his claws on me

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.710
Uses the same claws to defend someone else

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.710
Weapons turn into both wounds and shields

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.170
Isn't that what life's about?

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.960
A secret known to none

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.510
For so long almost seems to disappear but never does

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.300
Been holding on to it

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.010
While spending a night in the fire

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.600
The more they're attracted, the more the ignorant laugh

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.390
What used to make up the universe until yesterday takes the helm

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.650
The entire range of emotions that breathes

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.780
Don't want to take away what I haven't even experienced

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:11.070
Look at the imaginations in my head and I'll go back to myself

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:17.500
Forcing right decisions on me is like a devil that eats me up

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.830
Don't get in my way anymore

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:29.880
I won't be killed by your ideals

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.600
"Next time"

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.530
