WEBVTT

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.820
Raffles and his disciples used the flame bestowed by the great Sol

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.540
and the technology cultivated by mankind to create "Amaterasu."

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.330
The sacred flame of Amaterasu benefits the lives of mankind,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.800
and ended up establishing the foundation of a state in the Far East.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.270
An underground railway station?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
My turnout coat melted instantly. That's pretty intense.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.370
Where are you? I didn't hear a sound.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.950
Somewhere in the darkness...

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.770
The man with the flame that exterminates mankind, the Adolla Burst,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.140
does not belong with you.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.090
Bringing him here saves us a lot of trouble. We will take the Adolla Burst.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.070
What do you intend to do with Shinra?! What is your objective?!

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.610
Die.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.700
Inspector Licht!

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.180
I've been completely isolated. The enemy could appear at any second.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.020
I'm On-His-Toes Man!

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.690
Stop!

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.120
Inspector Licht!

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.080
Stay right where you are.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.990
Save me, Shinra-kun!

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.530
Man with the Adolla Burst, if you value this man's life,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.450
you're going to come with us.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.620
Shinra-kun, the Rapid!

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.540
You know, the tiger hand sign!

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.500
You keep quiet!

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.090
That was some incredible speed.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.140
"Rapid," huh? That's better than "Kicker-Man Kick."

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.600
Mwa-ha-ha-ha! Did you see that "Rapid-Man Kick"?

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.260
Just "Rapid" by itself is fine, isn't it?

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.190
You'll have Captain Shinmon shoot you down again otherwise.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.780
Nah, it needs the "Man."

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.210
Shinrabansho [all of nature].

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.740
You can't spell it without the man that ties my brother and me together.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.330
Me!

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.460
"Shinra"             "Man"

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.130
My brother!

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.460
"Sho"
"Man"! Put it together, and...

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.630
"Shinrabansho"

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.170
Shinrabansho!

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.920
So I have to be "Uses-'Man' Man"!

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.350
Makes sense. That explanation should please the strict Captain Shinmon, too.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.070
Is that Lieutenant Hinawa? The others are fighting the White-Clad, too.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.210
We can't let ourselves be outdone by them.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.620
Looks like my position has been compromised.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.270
My enemy is in the darkness.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.920
The light she releases is too strong, and I can't pin her location down.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.970
I tried to use my Ricochet Control to pepper a wide area,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.550
but there's no sign that I hit her.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.810
There are many obstacles in the area. Should I attempt close combat instead?

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.100
Whatever I do, this location is compromised.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.810
I have to move.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.400
Don't slow down, just slip through here and approach the enemy.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.960
We'll wait for our opening to strike, too.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.490
With Arrow? I doubt we'll get the chance.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.250
I have my Ricochet Control.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.500
Since we're both using long-range weapons, the closer I get,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.130
the greater my advantage should be.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.080
Did you think you could escape my arrows in there?

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.010
Quite the opposite. You've lost your route of escape.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.180
Break.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.930
Damn it!

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.820
This is your hunting ground.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.710
I don't let the prey I target escape. I'm taking the Adolla Burst, too.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.250
You people don't know the importance of life.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.550
You are not getting Shinra.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.930
The world is continuously changing,

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.600
and even now, is about to change dramatically.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.100
That transition does not require human emotion.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.980
Those who invoke or assert the importance of their existence

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.570
are fools who can't conform themselves to the way of world.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.030
What Shinra Kusakabe thinks or wants

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.210
has no meaning whatsoever.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.290
The Evangelist requires his Adolla Burst.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.300
We will take it.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.530
Once a person affiliates with an organization,

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.850
their individual feelings are no longer as important.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.440
When that extends to a nation or the world, all the more so.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.810
In a world where people suddenly catch fire,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.290
and their lives are snuffed out just like that,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.390
rather than always being tripped up by the chaos, and getting bogged down in it,

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:44.650
fulfilling your role as an unconcerned, dispassionate cog in society

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.800
is what's best for the world.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.190
There are more than a few people, myself included, who think that way.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.700
That way is easier, after all. Having feelings is exhausting.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.970
So why do you fight us?

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.210
Shinra's feelings don't matter, you say?

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.780
Hand over one of my men, you say? Don't insult me.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.130
While I agree that feelings are exhausting...

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.890
...I can't help but feel steamed.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.270
"Episode 20: Wearing His Pride"

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.400
Devastating...

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.730
A devastating roar... A devastating shockwave...

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.840
What is that man shooting?

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.500
They're standard 7.62×51mm rounds,

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.480
accelerated to as fast as they can go.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.680
Even if I don't get a direct hit, the sonic boom created by their extreme speed

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.010
means you don't stand a chance.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.300
That force is so great that a single shot destroys the barrel.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.350
Almost like a cannon. Is Arrow going to be all right?

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.410
I was planning to find an opening to strike at him,

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.250
but that would be like stepping into a shootout between two tanks!

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.030
All my strength is gone... and my eyesight...

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.480
I feel like my eyelids are stuck to my eyeballs.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.750
My consciousness is drifting away from my body.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.740
In this subterranean darkness and dust cloud,

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.280
the smell of gunpowder is the only thing I can clearly make out.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.630
What's become of... the other shooter?

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.450
In a world where people suddenly catch fire,

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.790
and their lives are snuffed out just like that...

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.780
...becoming indifferent to your own life is a way to devote yourself to that world.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.880
Even if I die, it won't...

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.030
The 8th, though... we don't even have an entire company,

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.150
and they still made me its lieutenant.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.650
I dread thinking of Captain Obi taking it all on himself.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.820
If I'm dead, who's going to look after our men?

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.460
The reason you didn't kill me is because your first shot

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.830
didn't hit my left shoulder, which bears the 8th's emblem.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.810
I'll use her flames...

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.360
...to increase its velocity even more!

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.570
"Velocity Unbridled"

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.830
That consumed quite a lot. I don't think I can move for a while.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.680
I guess the young ones wouldn't go along with this kind of never-give-up spirit.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.280
You're the fog and shimmer guys...

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.940
So you finally show yourselves, you cowards.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.640
Hitting the enemy when they're at their weakest is Tactics 101.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.680
Arrow has fulfilled her role.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.240
How does it feel to be killed by the coward you just insulted?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.370
I doubt you have any strength left to fight back.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.470
I'll finish you off.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.240
What a pity. That was a shimmer. Die.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.680
That was powerful, for a last-ditch effort,

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.690
but pointless if you don't hit him.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.360
No,

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.360
I hit what I was aiming for.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.820
Hmph.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.780
Descending from the heavens, but born out of the earth,

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.210
I venture both above and below...

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.360
I am a knight.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.710
I saw Arthur looking down from the ceiling.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.520
I shot him down.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:24.610
The one who summoned me, the heavenly champion, down to earth...

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.490
...was you, Lieutenant?

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.830
I don't have to explain the situation to you, do I?

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:37.040
No. His face was exposed then, but he's the one from Vulcan's workshop.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.910
Mirage, if you would?

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.880
So it's you.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.280
I'll bring you down again with my shimmers.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.810
One-trick pony, are you?

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.810
My "one trick" is bringing an end to all of this.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.810
Die!

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:13.080
I didn't sense the weight of life in that attack.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.450
On the battlefield, feel life.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.960
Your own life, your friends' lives, the other side's lives.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.670
When you're aware of all those lives, the tension won't get you so worked up.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.180
Don't get tripped up by diversions or feints.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.800
Discern the attack that is coming to take your life!

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:37.140
Concentrate. If I feel the life around me, I won't get worked up.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.290
I am now multiclassing, with the samurai abilities I've acquired.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.730
A knight-samurai.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.240
"Knight-samurai!!!"

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:52.370
Hold on.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.110
Focus.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.210
Being a knight-samurai would make me a samurai, wouldn't it?

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.790
Which would mean... what, exactly?

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.760
I see now, I have it backward.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.720
A samurai-knight.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.220
"Samurai-knight!!!"

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.970
Your dynamic visual acuity is too sharp.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:20.940
That may be why you're easily fooled by what meets the eye and fine movement.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.670
There's more out there than just what you can see.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.450
He must be speculating that they're all feint shimmers probing his reactions,

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.470
and just pretending to be discriminating.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.160
In that case,

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.410
with this large a number attacking en masse,

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.080
he's sure to think that the real me is mixed in with them.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.310
However, they're all fakes!

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.550
An earnest attack trying to take your life has a distinct breathing pattern.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.700
Be able to detect that breath of life.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.100
Watch, here it is, dummy!

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.150
The breath of the attack trying to take my life... The breath of life...

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.150
I will never get closer to you until you take the shimmer bait

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.000
and leave yourself open.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.530
And when that opening happens,

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.160
I will strike at you from the shadows with my throwing knife.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.910
First...

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.370
The breath of life!

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.190
Iai-calibur!

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.700
Hey, you! Are you trying to kill me just because I breathed?!

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.980
Don't jump to the wrong conclusion. I am a knight-samurai.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.110
I-Impossible...

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.730
He was hiding in the mist to stab not me, but you, Lieutenant.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.250
The man is as sneaky as they come.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.040
Can you get up?

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.920
Well done.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.340
What about the other one?

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.630
He left his pal here and ran off.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.220
What was up with his face?

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:17.800
Is he even human?

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.680
It looked like a put-on face. What did he look like, if not human?

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.070
First, we meet up with the others.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.740
Great. Lead the way.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.660
Well, whatever.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:50.530
The way splits again. The Nether sucks. I don't get it.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.710
Which way do you think we should go?

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.970
There's something glowing down the left way.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.640
Huh? Something's coming this way!

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.410
E-Eyes?!

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.230
--Eep! --Demon!

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.780
Who are you calling a gorilla cyclops?!

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.030
--I never said that! --I never said that!

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.120
Huh? Maki-san?

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.840
Then, those demonic eyes are...

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.910
...Sputter and Flare?

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.130
Wah! Maki-san!

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.460
Oh, there, there.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.260
Two life signs suddenly appeared.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.390
Fifteen meters? That's close enough for visual contact.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.790
Are they on our side?

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.810
You will never see anyone on your side again.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.630
Lisa...

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.360
You've wrapped yourself up in the turnout coat that you despise.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.830
You only look like a fool, Vulcan.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.830
You look good in anything.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.630
What are you doing down underground,

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.720
now that you've joined the Fire Force you hate so much?

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.050
Silly question. To come and see you, Lisa, obviously.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.050
What's the matter, Feeler?

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.360
Who was it that took you in?

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.990
Who taught that ignorant, dirty little cat so attentively?

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:45.490
I'm the one who showed you how to manipulate flames, and manipulate men.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:51.120
All you did was use everything I taught you to get close to Vulcan.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.840
The only reason he took you in was because of my instruction.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.090
You are just an ignorant, dirty little cat, after all.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.340
Do you need another one of my lessons?

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.350
Get away from Lisa!

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.770
Feeler, Knight of the Ashen Flame. That is my true name.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.620
"Knights of the Ashen Flame" "Junior Knight" "Feeler"

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.950
That's right. Defend me.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:29.700
Yes, sir.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.410
It's not true, Lisa!

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.500
Shut up!

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:35.680
The Iron-madillo?

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.360
I don't know what you taught Lisa-san,

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.360
but it's only right for grown-ups to teach the youth!

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.350
You're damn condescending, old geezer!

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.060
Then you're the real ignorant one here, feckless captain of the 8th.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.150
Call me whatever you like.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.860
You don't even know what the flames of human combustion are.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.550
Our Evangelist knows all.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.040
Including why the spontaneous human combustion

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.870
that is attacking our world is occurring,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.840
what the bugs that trigger artificial human combustion really are,

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:20.880
the secret of the Adolla Burst that Shinra Kusakabe possesses,

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:25.970
why that flame is called the "Flame of Perdition,"

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.930
what happened in the world in the past...

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.980
...and what is happening to it right now.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.450
The Evangelist knows all of it.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.570
I'm not going to tell you a thing.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.700
Then you really are a lousy teacher.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.910
You are an intriguing man.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.010
"To be continued"

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.480
"Next time"

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.530
"Episode 21: Those Connected"
