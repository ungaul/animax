00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.320
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.150
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.180
Tamaya!

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.020
Kagiya!

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.140
It's almost like a festival, huh?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.310
It must be their own special way of mourning,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.270
because it's different from other proto-nationalist funerals.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.450
Scaffolders, get started on repairs!

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.280
--Right! --Right!

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.990
Anyone whose house was demolished for Kantaro's funeral,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.030
you can stay at the guardhouse!

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.000
We'll look after you until the repair work is completed!

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.250
Captain, would it be okay if we went to help with the repairs, too?

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.210
Good idea. We can't really negotiate an investigation

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.840
until the town gets fixed up.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.320
Hey!

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.240
Please let the 8th help!

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.160
With my ability, hauling stuff and elevated work will be no problem.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.210
I'll move this rubble out of the way, too.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.710
You can leave the welding to me.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.340
Oh, not bad.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.680
Oh...

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.520
This is too heavy to move.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.310
The 8th's Matchbox was down on Yagen Street in Asakusa.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.310
What would the 8th be doing in the 7th's jurisdiction?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.480
The 8th went to investigate the 1st over the Rekka matter.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.860
They may be trying to sniff us out.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.870
What does the Evangelist say?

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.620
"Exterminate them." We failed to finish the job last time.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.540
Get the bugs and traps ready.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.840
The darkness is illuminated

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.470
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.180
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.600
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.270
The end is illuminated

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.860
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.610
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.990
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.830
Flames rise to show us the way

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.500
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.960
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.220
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.930
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.770
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.820
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.360
Playthings that make sounds

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.070
and magic that chases pain away

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.160
are all precious treasures to me

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.790
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.710
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.550
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.230
Today's work is done!

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.230
You don't have to trouble yourself, Waka.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.780
The youngsters have finally gotten a breather. At least let me do this much.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.160
Thank you.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.370
Does that hurt?

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.200
No, it's just cold.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.670
You really should have been the one to become captain, Konro.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.670
This is the 7th, where the rowdies come to live.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.010
Anyone who can't fight has no business being the captain.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520
Konro!
Waka!

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.230
Hey, hold on!

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.270
What? What's going on?

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.730
This big bozo is chasing Hika and Hina, trying to eat us!

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.570
He's seriously screwed up!

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.660
I was just playing tag with you, and you call me a bozo, you jerk?

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.330
I'm not showing off my flaming top for you anymore.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.040
Flaming top?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.410
He shoots flames out of his feet and spins around wicked fast.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.120
It's so ridiculous!

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.920
It's breakin'! Break dancing! And it's not ridiculous, it's cool!

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.170
Heh, such a kid...

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.890
Sorry about this, 8th. Not only do we have you help with repairs,

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.350
--but now you're looking after the little ones.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.100
--We're not little! We'll smoosh you, Konro! --but now you're looking after the little ones.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.100
--Nah, I don't mind hanging out with children.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.440
--Don't treat us like children! --Nah, I don't mind hanging out with children.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.110
We'll smoosh you, Shinra!

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.490
Here, I'll show you my flaming top. Here goes...

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.490
Shut up! Don't tell Hika and Hina what to do!

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.210
The folks from the 8th are some fairly pleasant people.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.590
They're not the same sort as the other Fire Force companies.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.750
Kind of like those of us in the 7th.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.220
I guess.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.220
Why not cooperate with their investigation?

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.770
If you were the captain, is that what you'd do?

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:05.190
Waka, you weren't chosen to be the captain just because you're strong.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.280
The reason the 8th's folks were helping us is because you--

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.950
I know. I've heard it over and over.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:17.450
I'm just not cut out for this sort of thing--being in charge of others.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.960
Come on, face forward. I can't wrap this bandage.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.510
I'll cooperate. I don't dislike these 8th folks.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.930
"Episode 12: Eve of Hostilities in Asakusa"

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.520
--Ah! Waka! --Ah! Waka!

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.230
I'm sorry about before, sir.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.770
Oh, no biggie.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.940
Um, about Lieutenant Konro's body...

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.280
When a third generation exceeds the limit of his pyrokinesis,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.740
his body starts incinerating if he keeps going,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.450
and before long, is reduced to ash.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.670
Tephrosis.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.920
Is this your first time seeing it?

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.920
We learned about it at the Training Academy,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.800
but this is my first time seeing it in person.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.670
At the time, I...

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.770
Shinra, I need to talk to your captain. Where is he?

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.730
I was actually asked by him to come and get you, Captain Shinmon.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.030
He's across the way talking to Lieutenant Hinawa, sir.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.990
What are you going to do now? Are you going back to the 8th?

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.490
As long as you're here, you could always stay over at our station.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.620
It wasn't what we planned,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.830
but after helping out with the repairs,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.960
we're on much better terms with the 7th guys.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.880
Hey, lady, strip again for us, okay?

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.710
I will not!

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.590
I hope we'll get permission to conduct our investigation now.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.810
Captain Shinmon said he wanted to talk to Captain Obi earlier,

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.180
so I think we'll be able to investigate.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.770
All we have so far are just breadcrumbs,

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.770
but we're still getting after the Evangelist.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.240
Seeing as how there are so many proto-nationalists in the 7th,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.700
we left Iris-sama behind,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.910
and the 5th is holding down things at the 8th while we're gone.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.170
I sure hope we can start investigating soon.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.500
"Nonessential"

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.300
Get that desk out of there and set up Shinra's desk!

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.550
You can toss Obi's personal things outside or something!

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.220
Oh... n-nee-san...

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.430
Captain Hibana, what is the reason for this?

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.640
Punishment for getting carried away and driving the 5th so hard.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.980
Should we just accept this?

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.190
Látom.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.190
Gravel! You gravel! Where does gravel get off telling me what to do?!

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.660
Ah! I am gravel! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.740
Please, step on me even more!

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.670
That went well, huh, Lieutenant?

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.090
Yes it did.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.460
We succeeded in turning that Kantaro guy into an Infernal.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.010
That we did.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.260
Let's turn even more people in this town into Infernals.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.510
Yes, let's.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.560
A fire?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.430
Maki-san!

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.190
I'm going to go check!

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.980
Don't do anything rash until we meet up with the captain!

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.570
What's suddenly happening? Why is he attacking?

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.490
It's because you ate their daifuku, Captain!

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.160
It was only one! He's overreacting!

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.080
I'll kill you.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.750
What's the matter?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.880
Shut up. Don't think you're getting out of Asakusa without paying.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.970
You turned Kantaro into an Infernal.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:09.600
We made him an Infernal? Captain Shinmon, what are you--?

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.230
Don't play dumb! Your true intent is to turn this city upside down!

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.700
You tricked us. I saw it with my own eyes.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.700
I don't know what you saw, sir, but please take it easy!

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.540
Huh? Screw that! There's no reason to take it easy!

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.330
"Evangelist" my ass!

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.790
I saw your captain and lieutenant

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:39.170
plotting how to turn this town's people into Infernals!

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.300
You're mistaken!

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.930
I'll crush you all and string you up!

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.310
I know exactly what I saw.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.680
It was definitely them.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.770
Captain, I don't think he's joking around.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.400
Wait a minute, please! We don't want to fight you!

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.610
Then go ahead and defeat me, and prove to me what you really want!

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.700
Around here, might makes right!

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:07.200
If you don't want to fight me, then prove it by fighting me!

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.120
Bring it on, 8th!

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.960
You're facing Shinmon Benimaru!

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.920
We managed to instigate him.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.840
Yes.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.920
On to our next trick.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.510
Hinawa!

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.050
Leave it to me, sir.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.680
Waka! The musclebound dummy is running away!

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.110
Hiding behind women and children? Just how rotten is your core?!

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.690
Everyone, get back!

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.110
We're Fire Soldiers, too! Would you mind not looking down on us?!

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.820
Did you think you deflected that?

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.330
Maki-san!

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.670
Whoa...

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.680
You can fire your peashooter at me all you want, but it won't work.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.350
I know it won't work. I was just seeing how much of your second generation

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.100
and third generation abilities you can use at the same time.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.860
Arthur! Tamaki!

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.300
Iai Chop, Form One...

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.890
Fire Moon.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.190
Is that all you've got, 8th?!

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.790
What have you done to my men?

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.580
Captain Obi...

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.580
Let's settle this, captain to captain!

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.350
Why the hell did you turn somebody from my town into an Infernal?

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.270
No matter what I say, you aren't going to listen.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.980
So just shut up and come at me!

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.530
You reveal your true nature, you scum!

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.950
You're not canceling them out?

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.290
Cancel them? There's no way I can do that, you know.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.330
I don't have any powers!

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.880
You what?

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.920
Then aren't you afraid of flames?

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.510
Sure I am! They're hot!

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.020
Why would somebody who knows the terror of flames

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.310
gratuitously turn Kantaro into an Infernal?!

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.280
I'm telling you, there's been some kind of mistake!

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.530
I clearly saw you! There can be no mistake!

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.910
Captain!

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.170
Don't talk to me about second generation or third generation.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.920
I train every day.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.250
An extinguisher grenade?

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.320
You gassed yourself, too?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.630
I finally got one shot in.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.210
You're not one to shy away, are you?

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.800
There's no way I could possibly shy away.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.550
I've taken being the captain of the 8th upon myself!

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.310
What's with the musclebound dummy? He's unpowered, right?

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.520
He got a shot in against Waka.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.730
Is the captain really that strong?

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.570
What, did you think he was weak?

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.400
But still, I can't bear to watch him fight so recklessly.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.490
Both Captain Shinmon and Captain Obi

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.490
have an innate knack for winning people over to them.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.660
We can't let the two of them keep fighting anymore.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.830
Is there any way we can stop them?

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:08.340
Is beating him the only way to set the record straight?

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.510
--Waka! --Let him have it!

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.760
What in the world is all this ruckus?

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.390
Word is that the 8th folks are the ones who turned Kantaro into an Infernal.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.350
Waka snapped and started this huge fight.

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.180
--Munch! --Munch!

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.440
What? That's ridiculous.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.070
Someone as strong as you? I'm not buying it!

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.240
You won't go down without a full-fledged attack, then?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.280
Then I'm done playing around.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:43.870
What is he planning to do?

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.330
No!

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.340
Iai Chop, Form Seven:

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.710
Sun Wheel.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.170
Waka! Don't!

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.170
Don't stop me, Konro.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.010
Did you know that these guys

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.140
are trying to turn the people of our town into Infernals?

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.020
That's ridiculous.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.850
I saw these two plotting it out!

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.270
How many times do I have to tell you, you're mistaken?!

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.610
Take this!

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.690
Konro! Let me go!

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.240
Waka, cool your jets!

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.660
You dumbass! Why the hell are you using your pyrokinesis?!

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.040
Hikage! Hinata! Bring me a cooling blanket!

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.870
Roger!

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.290
Wilco!

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:33.460
Waka, why don't you at least hear out what the 8th has to say?

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.060
What were you all doing when Waka saw what he thinks he saw?

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.060
Captain Obi and I

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.610
were buying some items we were short on at the town general store.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.110
We also told Maki that's where we were going.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.490
Yes, that's true.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.910
Huh? But the captain told me to go and get Captain Shinmon,

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.660
and that he'd be waiting in the back alley.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.750
I heard as much, and that's when I headed toward you.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.130
I don't remember ever saying that.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.800
Are you trying to fool your own men?!

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.260
I'm going to go ask around at the general store.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.930
For Konro's sake, I'm going to excuse this for the moment.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.020
Do not leave here until I say you're in the clear.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.570
Honestly, Waka is such a stubborn boy.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.070
After all this time, he's still the same.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.870
Lieutenant Konro,

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.950
would you tell us what happened to your body?

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.920
It's all because I wasn't strong enough.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:58.420
Captain Shinmon seemed remorseful about it, as well.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.510
Waka did nothing wrong. Waka didn't do anything wrong.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.600
Do you want to hear about it?

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.600
It happened before we formally joined the Special Fire Force.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.320
"Solar Year 196"

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.820
"Tokyo, Asakusa"

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.780
Run to the river!

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.120
What the hell is going on?

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.170
How can there be this many Infernalizations in one night?

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.420
Whatever the reason, right now, we have to get the people safely evacuated.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:46.140
What about the Special Fire Force? When are they finally going to get here?

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.390
We can't rely on them. We'll do it ourselves.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.640
Beni!

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.520
Damn it... Can't breathe...

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.480
Try as I might, it doesn't feel like I'm getting any oxygen...

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.910
You're at your pyrokinetic limit. Beni, you stay here.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.330
Don't be a dumbass! You're in the same boat as I am!

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.580
Wha--?

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.420
What is that thing?

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.760
A demon?!

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:38.360
That Infernal... is...

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.520
Oh, no!

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.570
What the hell are you doing, Konro?!

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:54.410
I have to go that far, or else a hell-raiser like yourself won't sit still.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:01.170
Beni, this isn't where you're going to meet your end.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.430
I'll deal with this!

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.980
"To be continued"

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.820
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.860
and curse the unwavering present,

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.990
but words that simply hang in the air

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.750
are not enough to save you

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.050
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:54.220
between sights we never reach

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.430
and pain that brings no warmth

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.560
to make it to a faraway place

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.820
Given the hope that you speak of

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.030
or the ideals that you dream of

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:13.780
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.040
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.000
and curse the unwavering present,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.210
but words that simply hang in the air

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:29.800
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.850
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.060
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.180
I hope we can still walk together again

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.440
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.150
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.570
"Next time"
