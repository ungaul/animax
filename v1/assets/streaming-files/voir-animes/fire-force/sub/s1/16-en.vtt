00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.530
As the world was being covered in ash, one man appeared.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.830
He would later be called Raffles I.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.620
Raffles took his disciples and left on a journey in search of light.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.790
At the end of his journey, he found an "unsullied flame,"

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.710
and brought forth the light that would be mankind's salvation.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.470
Here.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.190
Granddad, Pop, I brought your favorite sodas.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.980
The tops are opened, so you don't have to worry about them spraying out.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.990
The two of you are gone, so it's three times as much work for me.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.910
But since you brought me up to be tough, I'm managing somehow.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.990
Once I decide to do something, it's surprising how well I can do it.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.290
Also, I have some people helping me.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.960
My new family.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.970
Whew.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.310
Vulcan!

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.890
Please check my prototype.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.480
Oh, Yu, you put this together pretty well.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.940
Thank you very much!

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.280
All that's left is... Something's left?

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.030
Whoa! Huh?!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.370
Aw, it's still not good enough.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.450
If you smash it that hard, of course it's not!

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.420
You dumbass. Some things in this world can't break, no matter what.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.920
Like what?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.470
Ships and cars. People would be in danger if they broke down, right?

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.090
Then there's Amaterasu.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.100
Everlasting perpetual power generation. It never stops, and never breaks down.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.140
Awesome, right? If it did break down, it would be an empire-wide disaster.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.360
Val! Yu! Dinner's ready.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.990
Lisa, you made something else that's indestructible, huh?

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.700
It's food. Don't hold back, just dig in.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.080
Thank you for this food.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.160
"All things must pass." It's said that anything with form falls apart someday.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.130
I wonder if people's feelings and bonds have a form.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.760
Do families fall apart in time?

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.060
Pop and Granddad died, and my family was broken up.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.940
Then again, even dead, we're still a family. Those bonds don't break.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.990
I want to build those bonds, the kinds that don't break!

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.950
"Episode 16: We Are Family"

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.630
Dr. Giovanni is out to take Vulcan's life?

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.090
I don't know the reason why, but that's what I felt.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.470
The captain of the 3rd was here trying to recruit Vulcan-san, right?

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.060
Why would he be out for his life?

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.350
It might have something to do with his history with Haijima.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.730
Even if you tell Vulcan about this, do you think he'll believe you?

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.690
I mean, I don't even believe it.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.950
Does this have something to do with the "Adolla Burst"

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.490
that you mentioned right afterward?

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.080
Adolla Burst... Adolla Link...

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.330
It happened at Asakusa, too. It was too distinct for it to be a mere hunch,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.920
almost like I was hearing someone's voice.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.760
Moreover, it was real.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.840
I can't afford to let this intuition pass by, either.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.560
Sister, you and Arthur go back to the workshop and tell Vulcan he's in danger.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.730
Right.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.520
What are you going to do?

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.070
I don't know if we're dealing with just Dr. Giovanni, or Company 3.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.030
Still, the other side won't know that we're here, too.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.570
If I can ascertain the enemy's movements from a high vantage point,

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.990
we can make the first move.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.750
Arthur, you and I are the only ones who can fight. It's up to you.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.290
Wait! Say that one more time!

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.420
Kill everyone in the workshop.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.930
In this day and age, there are Infernals, fires...

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.470
...any number of causes of death available.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.390
--Yes, sir. --Yes, sir.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.020
Hold up.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.430
Get rid of those false clothes.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.600
--As you command. --As you command.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.650
--Faithfulness to the Evangelist. --Faithfulness to the Evangelist.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.610
You say Dr. Giovanni is going to kill me?

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.410
I'm the one who resents him enough to kill him! Why should he come after me?

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.580
Well, um...

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.120
It's kind of like we heard it! That's what it was like!

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.800
I thought you were a little strange to be Fire Soldiers,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.130
but are you also using ridiculous threats to get me to come with you?

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.550
You really don't have any idea why?

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.640
You have some kind of history with Haijima, right?

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.390
Like I said, I'm the one who has the beef with them!

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.100
Ah! Vulcan!

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.740
The back way is surrounded, too.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.660
All for me? This is way out of proportion.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.410
He let that big a force get by unnoticed?

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.910
What is Shinra doing?!

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.290
It's so quiet.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.140
I thought things seemed unusual at the workshop.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.850
The folks from the 8th are here, are they?

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.520
I wasn't counting on that.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.690
Damn it, who's there?

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.900
Where are you?!

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:55.280
That's the 8th's rookie who possesses an Adolla Burst.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.040
I'll capture him and take him to the Evangelist.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.620
What?!

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.300
They're flying it by controlling the booster in the wrist.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.670
They're a second generation?

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.930
Just follow the wire...

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.890
They're gone.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.610
Ow!

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.110
What kind of monster are you? This is two million volts of current.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.570
Okay then...

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.740
Your friends at the workshop are now meeting the same fate that you are.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.330
What...?

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.970
"Is the enemy behind that tree? What if they aren't?"

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.510
"Is there only one of them? Or several?"

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.520
"Do I feint and see what happens?"

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.600
When you don't consider every possibility, you make mistakes.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.400
But you picked the wrong opponent. Running away was the right call.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.320
Sometimes it's necessary to look twice before you leap.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.620
This is Dr. Giovanni.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.950
I just found an unexpected bonanza. Requesting retrieval.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.330
Yeah, that's right. The man with the Adolla Burst.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.260
This will bring us one step closer to salvation of the world

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.840
by the grace of the Evangelist.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.310
All that remains is to get the key that Vulcan has.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.600
You're Fire Soldiers, right? Do something.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.690
I don't have the gear I need to use my ability.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:53.230
Also, I don't feel very knightly right now, so I can't get going.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.860
If I don't feel knightly, I can't use my ability.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.610
Huh?

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.950
Without something more swordly, this is all the firepower I have.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.250
Something more swordly would raise my firepower.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.210
I am the Knight King, Arthur Boyle!

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.590
The more I look the part of a knight, the stronger my ability becomes!

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.010
That's why I am a knight!

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.640
I could tell at first glance, but you really are dumb, huh?

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.890
In short, If I make you more knightly, you'll get stronger, right?

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.690
Knightly... Knightly...

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.490
A horse?

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.660
Mirage, wait here and keep the perimeter in place.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.410
Got it.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.330
I'll go take out the people inside.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.930
Vulcan, is putting blue sheeting over him going to be enough?

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:13.440
He went out there happy. It all depends on how he feels. Who am I to say?

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.280
Here goes.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.740
Silver!

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.830
Then again, that's not a horse, it's a donkey, right?

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.870
It's asking an awful lot to call him a knight looking like that.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.170
It is my mission from the king to protect the princess

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.090
and the other VIPs in that water mill.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.090
I cannot allow you to pass.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.640
You're not from the workshop, are you?

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.020
Arthur-san's sword flame is stronger than usual.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.570
Huh? You're kidding, right?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.610
High-ho, Silver!

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.910
By the providence of the Round Table!

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.500
Ex-- --caliver!

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.790
Wh-What was that?!

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.670
My shimmers...!

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.510
So your army was a bunch of flimsy paper dolls?

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:29.060
No one told us there was a man like this here other than those in the workshop.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.350
Who the hell are you?!

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.150
I am the Knight King, Arthur! Second Class Fire Soldier of Company 8!

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.320
I'll eliminate you if you interfere.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.410
The will of his flame is strong. Don't get sloppy.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.720
That idiot is ridiculously strong, isn't he?

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.010
The Knight King is one with his steed! You cannot stop us!

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.950
No matter how many of you there are, I will not allow you to pass!

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.160
You look ridiculous, but what firepower.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.210
Hmph, my appearance looks unusual to you, villain?

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.050
Fakes!

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.970
--I'm telling you, this won't work. --I'm telling you, this won't work.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.600
--Who is this oddly-dressed person? --Who is this oddly-dressed person?

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.520
It's you.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.270
--Huh? --Huh?

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.440
--Th-That's... me...? --Th-That's... me...?

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.370
This isn't knightly.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:29.090
On closer look, Silver, you're...

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.100
...not a horse, but a donkey, aren't you?

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.860
Ah! Vulcan, the magic has been dispelled!

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.280
S-Silver!

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.490
What's your deal? Are you messing with us?

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:58.120
Do you think I'd mess around when my beloved horse has been killed?

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.870
His firepower has dropped off considerably.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.920
You'll pay for this.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.630
The folks surrounding the rear have disappeared, too.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:15.140
Lisa! Yu! Now's your chance! You're getting out through the back way!

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.810
You there, from the 8th, pair up with her. Take her someplace safe.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.560
Vulcan-san, what about you?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.400
I'm the one they're after, right? You don't have any reason to stay with me.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.400
No way! I'm not just going to leave you here and run away, Vul!

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.240
Vulcan, you should escape with us!

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.450
We're family, aren't we?

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:42.710
He may be an idiot, but I can't run and leave the guy fighting for me behind.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.050
Why are they after you?

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.130
I can't go along with this unless I know why.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:57.060
I don't know. Except that Haijima has taken everything from our family.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.020
Our family, and our technology.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.560
Technology?

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.060
Yeah, that's right. The culmination of the technology

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.070
that my forefathers spent so much of their time and pride to create.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.410
My forefathers are the ones who built Amaterasu.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.950
There's something I made for an occasion like this out back.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.500
You can get away using it.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.290
Even separated, we're an indestructible family.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.040
Vulcan...

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.420
Sister, I hate to do this, but look after these two.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.300
Weak as I am, I'm still a Fire Soldier. Leave it to me!

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.230
What are you doing...?

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.990
Lisa-san, what are you doing?

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.860
Yu, keep quiet.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.820
Don't move!

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.910
Try anything funny and I'll kill him.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.920
It wasn't a coincidence that you took me in back then.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.630
Wh-What?

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:13.380
It was all so I could sneak in and find a certain something.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.880
Hand over the key to Amaterasu.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:21.770
The key to Amaterasu? Lisa, what are you talking about?

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.310
I am a servant of the Evangelist.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.320
You say you want to build something that won't break?

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.110
It was broken to begin with--

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.650
playing house like we were.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.080
O-Oh, no... It's not true...

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.710
Lisa-san, please stop!

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.210
Giovanni is heading this way.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.800
If you don't tell me where the key is, he'll kill you.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.760
What is this, Lisa? Are you concerned about me?

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.270
Just how gullible are you?

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.310
Wrong again!

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.310
Damn it!

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.190
Don't let anyone in.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.530
Very well.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.740
You're not getting past me!

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.450
The shoe is on the other foot now.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.750
You're the one who can't get near the workshop.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:37.010
Lisa, stand down. I'll take it from here.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:43.390
Vulcan, you can die after you tell me where the key is, or you can die now.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.810
Choose.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.060
Giovanni...

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.730
Lisa was here undercover to search for the key to Amaterasu.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.440
Gullible people don't suspect others, so they get tricked.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.410
You should learn to look twice before you leap.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.910
Was it fun to play house with Lisa?

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.250
Was that really the reason why you came to my workshop?

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.420
Your foolishness must be handed down generationally.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.340
Everyone in your family line was pathetically gullible.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.300
Appeal to your emotions, and you're quickly fooled.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.850
Your old man was the same way.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.730
Generation after generation of deceived fools.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:33.190
However, when it came to Amaterasu, at least, they were cautious.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:38.780
They did look twice before leaping with the key to Amaterasu.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.660
I'm not hiding anything, and I don't have anything!

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.410
Was that child a part of your little make-believe family?

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.130
Stop!

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.210
Where is the key to Amaterasu?

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.840
Damn you, Giovanni!

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.470
Well? Do you remember now?

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.480
Yu! Yu!

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.980
Yu-san!

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:20.780
It's a life-threatening wound, but there may still be time if you act now.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.870
Stop this, already! Save Yu, now!

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:33.370
You're the one who hurt him. You didn't tell me what I want to know.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.460
Where is the key?

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.960
What do you mean, key? I have no way of knowing!

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.180
Please, don't take anything more from us.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.890
I have made careful arrangements, stopped your supply of materials,

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.270
been especially cordial in recruiting you,

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.390
and sent in Lisa undercover.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.560
I have looked, and looked, and looked, and looked, and looked,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.610
and looked, and looked, and looked, and looked, and looked,

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.150
and looked, and looked, and looked, and looked before I leapt.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.360
Do you really not know?! Damn you, Vulcan!

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.910
As dumb as you all are, you hid the key, and that's why this is happening!

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:15.580
Your whole family is a rotten mass of technology, talent, and gullibility!

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.170
Damn you, Giovanni... I'll kill you!

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.590
I have looked, and looked, and looked, and looked, and looked,

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.760
and looked, and looked, and looked, and looked for that key!

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.810
I should have leapt, and leapt, and leapt, and leapt, and leapt,

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.480
and leapt, and leapt, and leapt, and leapt, and leapt, and leapt,

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.940
and leapt on you to make you talk!

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.740
Does he really not know where it is?

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.540
He treasures these worthless pieces of junk so much.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.590
Stop... that...

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.100
It's breaking...

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.230
It's broken...

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:21.980
"To be continued"

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.570
"Next time"

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:58.500
"Episode 17: Black and White and Gray"
