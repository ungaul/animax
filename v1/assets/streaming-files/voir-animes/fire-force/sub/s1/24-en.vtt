WEBVTT

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.820
Raffles and his disciples used the flame bestowed by the great Sol

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.540
and the technology cultivated by mankind to create "Amaterasu."

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.330
The sacred flame of Amaterasu benefits the lives of mankind,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.840
and ended up establishing the foundation of a state in the Far East.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.230
"Fire Force"

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.070
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.070
Yeah.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.290
Without you around, Arthur tends to go off, and be a real pain.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.160
Yeah.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.170
That jerk tried to dispose of some piled-up documents with Excalibur.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.460
Yeah.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.050
Say something other than "yeah," Devil.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.590
Yeah, okay.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.680
Listen...

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.890
Don't do that in front of the sister and Maki-san, okay?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770
You'll just make them worry again.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.690
I know you've got your brother and stuff on your mind,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.650
but you aren't all alone.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.030
Yeah.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.700
Well, thinking about it too hard won't help. Not your strong suit.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.160
Oh, shut up.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.870
Come to think of it, Tamaki's there, too.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.170
Yeah. Toss in the cat girl, too.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.730
I'm glad you got out of the hospital okay.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.780
Sorry to worry you.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.280
Is everything the same with the others?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.360
Yes.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.530
They're all quite well.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.620
"No running in the halls!!" "Special Fire Force Company 8"

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.120
Shinra, congratulations on being discharged.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.040
I'm sorry I couldn't come in person!

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.090
I was worried about you.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.720
Oh, that's okay. You had to be standing by in case of a callout.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.430
Welcome back, Shinra. Glad to see the Adolla Burst is safe.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.150
Nothing that happens seems to kill him. Such a problem devil...

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.700
Yo, Devil. Looks like you didn't get into heaven.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.330
What about you? Still haven't gone completely rotten, you oniony bastard?

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.160
Good to have you back, Shinra.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.420
Yes, sir.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.750
I'd like you to compile the incident reports on the Nether right away,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.260
but your report to the captain comes first.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.180
Congratulations on getting out, Shinra.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.140
Second Class Fire Soldier Shinra Kusakabe

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.930
returning to duty as of this date.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.570
"Several weeks earlier"

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.410
How has the 6th been recently?

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.620
Doing just fine, sir. We have Captain Huang, after all.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.290
Things are nice and quiet--

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.040
What the...?!

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.090
Ho, so this is the light-speed you've attained by receiving grace, is it?

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.850
Kusakabe-san! You should be on strict bed rest! Go back to your bed!

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.440
Let them finish this. You're not going to be able to stop them.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.360
Burns is an old-fashioned hard-head.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.200
Heavy-handed interchange is all he knows.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.750
He's provoked by the young lad's growth, and simmering on the inside.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.790
Why didn't you tell me?!

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.090
Whatever your reasons were, I don't accept them!

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.130
Fire Soldiers have ambition. We can't act on personal feelings.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.800
Stand back.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.810
Looks like he's getting warmed up.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.860
Feels like I could get crushed just getting near him.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.660
By stoking his internal flame

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.080
and circulating the heat energy produced by it throughout his body,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.370
he can exhibit a tremendous physical ability.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.750
Burns' body becomes an enormous mass of heat energy,

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.960
which could rightly be called an embodiment of flame.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.970
Those who are weak lose their lives.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.840
That's why I couldn't afford to tell you the truth.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.810
If you want to know, then convince me by showing me

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.680
that you're strong enough to hear it.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.020
Huh?!

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.310
Captain Burns, you came here to tell me what happened 12 years ago!

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.360
Quit screwing around!

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.690
What's wrong? Don't think you can do it?

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.320
No, you damn...

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.450
...liar!

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.290
He just called a superior officer a damn liar, didn't he?

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.040
He held back as hard as he could, though.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.420
Okay... You got it.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.970
I'm going to show you that I'm not as fragile as you think I am.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:53.110
All I could save was this one, vulnerable little life.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.820
I'll take him down... I'll take him down...

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.990
That jerk is gonna pay... He's going down.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.380
I'm surprised you grew up this big and strong.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.960
You're going to tell me, whatever it takes!

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.510
Is that all the resolve you have?

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.680
No better than a candle flame.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.060
Don't mock me.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.520
I've got more than this!

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.330
You're sure you won't regret anything I tell you?!

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.750
As much as I hated flames, I became a Fire Soldier...

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.960
...so I could learn the truth!

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.100
Imagine, that tiny little flame...

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.230
...growing to be as big as this...

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:10.320
It's been a long time. My arm stings from where you hit me.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.150
You've gotten strong.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:19.660
You've made your resolve known. Very well, I'll tell you everything.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.910
What you know about that fire is not the truth.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:29.130
The group under the Evangelist that you fought...

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.500
"Episode 24: The Burning Past"
...was already active 12 years ago.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.590
"Solar Year 198"

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.560
Do you sense anything?

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.810
The Evangelist said this was the area, right?

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.560
A new Adolla Burst is going to be born.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.650
Aw, yeah!

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.150
"Evangelist's Subordinate: Haumea"

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.490
The Evangelist knew ahead of time that there would be a fire.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.700
Then the Evangelist and company really did...

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.750
The cause of that fire was quite clear. It wasn't you.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.000
That's right! There was a demon Infernal there!

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.380
"Evangelist's Subordinate: Haumea"

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.470
We welcome you, third one.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.020
Sho!

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.980
Shinra!

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.940
Hurry! Run away! Hurry!

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.120
Hurry... Shinra... Run away...

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.880
A demon...?

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.180
Sho! Sho!

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.140
The source of that fire 12 years ago...

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.060
...was your younger brother, Sho.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.110
Sho! Sho!

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.820
It was the effect of Sho's Adolla Burst

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.240
that evoked your third-generation abilities.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.010
You understand the reason why we are blindfolded, right?

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.180
Well, of course.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.220
If we look directly at the sun, we'll burn our eyes.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.890
Though the sun shineth, the children of men see it not;

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.230
if thou desirest to draw nigh unto the celestial world,

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.440
simply feel it in thy heart.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.210
The horned Infernal that you said you saw was...

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.840
Mom...?

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:31.230
It can't be... I've come all this way just to find that Infernal... and destroy it...

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:52.710
The cause of the fire was Sho, and the demon Infernal I saw was my mom...

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.130
In that case, whatever happened to my mom?

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:01.760
I arrived on the fire scene 15 minutes after it started.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.010
Where are the survivors inside? Why aren't they doing anything to put it out?!

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.010
There's something strange about this fire!

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.600
The water isn't knocking it down at all!

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.520
Start fighting the fire again!

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.770
Those of you who are third generation and can tolerate the flames, with me!

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.900
We're charging in there and identifying any survivors!

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.990
Three, two, one!

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.500
A survivor!

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.250
Get a paramedic!

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.290
Yes, sir!

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.510
Let me go! My mom and Sho are still inside there!

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.680
There's a bad demon close by!

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.260
--It's too dangerous! Take it easy!
--Burns... --It's too dangerous! Take it easy!

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:49.680
--Burns... --Sho! Mom! Let me go! Sho! Mom!

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:55.060
--An inextinguishable fire... A demon... Nothing feels right about this. --Sho! Mom! Let me go! Sho! Mom!

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.520
I'm going in!

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.570
The body set up to look like the mother is in place.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.820
Haumea, how about it? Are you in control?

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.330
Haumea. Talk to me, Haumea. Have you done it?

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.040
Hey, Haumea!

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.790
Haumea!

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.580
Shut your trap, Charon! I'm doing it now!

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.800
Get lost if you're gonna disturb me! I'll kill you!

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.050
If you could hear me, answer.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.430
Huh? If I answer you, are you gonna help me? No, you can't!

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.060
So shut your stupid face and go flap in the wind!

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.890
Okay, my bad... My bad...

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.360
She's terrifying.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.280
Given the situation, things are already...

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.790
A demon and baby...!

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.340
Bring the baby and come here.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.510
Hold it!

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.140
Burns! It's coming down! Get out of there!

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.640
The Infernal...!

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:16.770
Hurry!

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.600
Watch your head!

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.290
A demon Infernal... An Adolla Burst...

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.500
An Adolla Link...

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.130
The flame in my right eye isn't subsiding.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:52.470
Just like when I previously saw the light in the other world and it burned away.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.300
Mom! Sho!

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.600
Watch it! Don't go near there!

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.350
They didn't go after that boy.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:04.480
His abilities have been awakened. Still, his flames are yet weak.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.690
Burns... Yeah.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.700
Listen closely to me.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.830
Your mother is dead.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.040
So is your brother.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.550
Why did you lie to me?

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:38.720
To keep you out of it. They might have come after you at some point, too.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.850
I told you that lie so that you'd fear and hate flames.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.520
I thought that if you were afraid of flames,

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:51.280
you'd avoid using your pyrokinetic abilities and stay out of this world.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.820
I do hate them, even now. Whatever the facts may be,

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.660
flames have taken everything away from my family.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:05.080
Flames have derailed everything. There's no way I could ever like them.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.170
Still, you used your flames to come as far as you have.

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.510
I've accomplished my reason for coming today.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.890
Please wait, sir.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:24.520
Captain Burns, did you know about the Adolla Link when you saw into that hell?

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.850
Yeah.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.480
My right eye is the price I paid for seeing the flames of hell.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.820
Was that demon 12 years ago an Infernal with horns growing out of its eyes?

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.450
Yes, it was.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.450
Then that demon probably was Mom...

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.620
Where did my mom go, sir?

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.170
I never saw her after that.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:59.260
By using the Adolla Link, I can once again see that Infernal.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.480
I can see Mom again... But how do I Link again?

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.480
That man might know something.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.480
Kusakabe-san, please go back to your bed, now.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.280
--You look like him! --What?

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.910
I look like him?

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.410
Um, Lieutenant Hague... Yes?

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.710
Lieutenant Hague, are you and the 4th's...?

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:36.840
Ah, yes. Captain Soichiro Hague of the 4th is my grandfather.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.680
Huh? Why? Do I really look like him?

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:45.430
Oh, no! You just remind me of him symbolically, is all. You're fine!

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.100
I'm fine?

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.270
Listen, would it be possible for me to meet with Captain Hague?

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.690
With the captain, you say?

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.410
That is my report.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.870
You think that the Adolla Link and Captain Hague may be somehow connected?

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.790
Yes, sir. In order to verify that, I asked his blood relative,

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.300
Lieutenant Asako Hague of the 6th, to help me.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:22.140
I was just thinking of contacting the chief of the Fire Defense Agency.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.310
Let's try reaching out from this end, as well.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.720
But...

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.770
...if we assume that Captain Burns' story is true,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:35.730
it means that the Evangelist's group was involved in the incident with your family.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.990
It's not so easy to believe that the demon I thought was my enemy

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.450
turned out to actually be my mom.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.450
But I also thought Sho was dead, when in fact, he's still alive.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:47.490
If...

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.580
...your mother has become an Infernal, and is still alive...

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:58.010
I will find a way to turn an Infernal back into a person.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.010
"Fire Force"

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.100
Look at the imaginations in my head and I'll go back to myself

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:17.110
Forcing right decisions on me is like a devil that eats me up

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.910
He that used his claws on me

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.710
Uses the same claws to defend someone else

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.710
Weapons turn into both wounds and shields

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.170
Isn't that what life's about?

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.960
A secret known to none

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.510
For so long almost seems to disappear but never does

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.300
Been holding on to it

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.010
While spending a night in the fire

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.600
The more they're attracted, the more the ignorant laugh

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.390
What used to make up the universe until yesterday takes the helm

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.650
The entire range of emotions that breathes

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.780
Don't want to take away what I haven't even experienced

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:06.070
Look at the imaginations in my head and I'll go back to myself

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:12.500
Forcing right decisions on me is like a devil that eats me up

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.830
Don't get in my way anymore

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:24.880
I won't be killed by your ideals

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.400
What a dump.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.030
"Shinra, congratulations on your discharge"

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:57.210
Don't feel bad. Those who aren't knights find it harder to use swords.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.710
Screw you, you oniony bastard!

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.340
--I'll definitely cut this faster than him! --I'll definitely cut this faster than him!

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.090
Take it easy.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.140
--Ah! --...King! Knight King!

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.270
Látom.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.780
Gravel just needs to behave like gravel.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.110
Lieutenant Karim!

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:31.200
Hm? Oh, Tamaki! What a relief to see you reveling in the revelry.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:37.710
Um, I... uh... Can I be taken off suspension, please?!

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.510
For the party.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.880
Thank you very much, sir.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.090
I'm just here to drink some saké.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.510
But Shinra is still too young to drink.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.770
I didn't bring it for the kid to drink.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.180
Those of us who can drink can enjoy it among ourselves.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.730
How about you?

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:09.150
Do you enjoy saké, my princess? If you like, you could join me, tonight...

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.950
Yes, but just a little bit.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.410
Underage gorilla.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.910
Who are you calling a gorilla cyclops?!

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:20.000
I never said that... Okay,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.420
I am very pleased tonight to host this grand party

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:29.590
to celebrate Shinra, crewman from Special Fire Force Company 8,

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.970
being discharged from the hospital.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:36.390
Coming off our earlier investigation into the Nether...

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:37.930
Thank you for this food.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.940
"See you later"

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.650
Látom.
