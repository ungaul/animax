00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.030
A long time ago, mankind was touched by the planet's anger,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.910
and the world was engulfed in flames.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.620
It was the Day of the Cataclysm.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.200
The flames burned ferociously,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.790
with an intensity threatening to incinerate the places mankind lived,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.540
the languages they spoke, and the culture they had built up.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.650
--Látom. --Látom.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.150
Haran has been martyred, and returned to the flame.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.610
"Knights of the Ashen Flame" "Commando Unit" "Yona"

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.790
However, a new demon was born there. Also...

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.250
"Knights of the Ashen Flame" "Primary Vice-Commander" "Arrow"

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500
...we confirmed that the Adolla Burst possessed by the 8th's new recruit...

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
...had an Adolla Link with the demon.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.510
An Adolla Link? I want it at any cost. It is what the Evangelist desires.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.180
It would be a waste to leave it in the Fire Force.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.810
It may also be connected...

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.770
I will go along next time.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.110
"Knights of the Ashen Flame" "Commander" "Sho Kusakabe"

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.650
Supplementary crewmen? I don't care who they are, that was unusually fast.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.110
Haijima said the 8th doesn't have a science team,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.700
so they strong-armed this one through.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.000
They're plotting something.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.750
Strong-armed?

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.250
I thought that it was because after the Evangelist incident,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.840
each company was instructed by the empire to beef up their forensics.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.090
It's true, our science team is lacking, and we have been searching,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.970
but we have been making do with help from the 5th's Captain Hibana.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.940
Yes, but you can't rely on another company's captain forever, can you?

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.730
Which is why I'm here from Haijima.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.490
Viktor Licht, hereby assigned as Special Fire Force Company 8's forensic team.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.990
"Forensic Science Team" "Unpowered" "Viktor Licht"

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.210
I smell a rat.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.510
A Fire Soldier always salutes with the right hand.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.760
Oh, sorry about that, Lieutenant Hinawa.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.180
I'm a scientist, and all. My bad, my bad.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.600
So... ...as a scientist...!

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.810
--Whoa, easy! --Are these the Adolla Burst feet?!

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.730
Oh, let's see here...!

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.360
Do not touch Shinra so casually!

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.910
Mm-hmm.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.410
Crunch!

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.250
"Viktor"
Viktor Licht.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.210
Advanced placement into Tokyo Imperial University.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.040
On top of which, after graduating at the top of your class,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.970
you headed the applied pyrokinesiology lab at Haijima Heavy Industries.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.890
So I'm brilliant. Sorry.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.720
--So why would someone as brilliant as you join a dump like the 8th?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.770
--Hey! --So why would someone as brilliant as you join a dump like the 8th?

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.100
--So why would someone as brilliant as you join a dump like the 8th?

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.400
I used to be all cooped up by myself in my lab at Haijima,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.360
so I thought I'd get my hands on some raw data

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.570
through an outfit that was much closer to the scene of the action.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.160
If there are any problems, you can kick me out, but please let me join you.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.790
From what I can see, far from having a science team,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.710
you don't even have an engineer, do you?
"Position" "Captain" "Engineer" "Equipment" "Cleaning" "Cooking" "Science" "First Class Fire Soldier" "Second Class Fire Soldier" "Crap Knight King" "Second Class Fire Soldier
"Name" "Obi" "Hinawa"
"Maki" "Shinra" "Arthur" "Tamaki"

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.960
Who is servicing your vehicle right now?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.250
If you're careless with machinery, you'll be up a creek later on.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.510
We have a line on an engineer. Lieutenant, have you contacted him yet?

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.890
No, still no word from Vulcan.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.680
You guys are trying to get him on your crew?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.560
Who is he?

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.020
From Haijima to the Special Fire Force,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.860
everyone who's tried to recruit him so far has been turned away.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.070
He's Vulcan--

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.450
someone with crackerjack skill that lives up to the name

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.490
of the God of Fire and the Forge.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.830
Perhaps we should pay a visit to his workshop directly sometime soon.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.000
I wouldn't recommend it. He hates Haijima,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.510
and apparently also hates the Special Fire Force for dealing with them.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.300
You'll just end up getting driven away.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.470
Shinra,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.220
would you head over to Vulcan's workshop with Arthur and the sister?

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.350
I want you to go see if he's someone appropriate for the 8th.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.310
You want us to go and make such an important decision?

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.110
You're around the same age as Vulcan.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.070
Don't be too eager. Just go by how you honestly feel about it.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.160
--Yes, sir! --Yes, sir!

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.410
Better go in your street clothes so you don't look too uptight.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.620
But there's no need to be cagey about who we are.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.250
Be sure not to mislead him about anything.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.920
He being who he is, if you just get to say hello, you'll be successful.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.380
Roger wilco, sir!

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.340
--Whereas the other companies tried to address him with money or status, --"Roger wilco"? What does that mean?

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.640
--Whereas the other companies tried to address him with money or status, --It's something the people at the 7th were using.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.760
--they're persuading him with these kids. --It's something the people at the 7th were using.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.850
--they're persuading him with these kids. --What a delightful expression.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.430
--What a delightful expression.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.440
Vulcan has a bona fide hatred of the Fire Force. This is a fool's errand.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.820
We at the 8th are trying to transform this country.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.740
Might as well go for it.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.070
Always with the fascinating moves.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.990
I guess we'll get to see...

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.620
...if the 8th will be useful to us for achieving our objective.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.630
I've seen the animal with the long snout in a picture book before.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:35.550
Let's see, what was it called again? "Elephant," was it?

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.680
This place is incredible.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.930
Excuse us, please!

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.400
Maybe he isn't in.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.520
Maybe he's pretending not to be in.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.070
Second Class Fire Soldier Arthur Boyle, the Knight King!

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.580
You dare show hostility toward the Knight King?

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.080
He was reacting to you being a Fire Soldier!

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.580
Get lost!

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.290
Ee-yow!

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.170
"Stinging"

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.710
Hmph, how thickheaded.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.710
Eep!

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.300
Ah! Hey, you! Stop screwing around and get out here!

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.810
Projectile weapons don't work against Knights!

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.180
Um, was there something you needed?

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.560
--Huh?! --Huh?!

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.320
Látom.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.900
Please excuse us. We're here from Special Fire Force Company 8.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.120
I'm First Class Fire Soldier Shinra Kusakabe.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.830
I'm a hero.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.330
If you Fire Soldiers have come here,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.000
you must want to recruit the master.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.920
Master? I've returned with the parts you asked for.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.670
Eep!

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.680
Yu, I told you not to call me "master."

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.520
Either call me "Vulcan" or "scumbag."

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.650
Okay, Vulcan, I have all the parts in my bag.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.900
--Hold it, scumbag! --Hold it, scumbag!

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.860
Hey, that's enough-- What? There's someone else inside?

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.700
I'm not helping Fire Soldiers. Leave!

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.710
He really is a dyed-in-the-wool hater of Fire Soldiers, isn't he?

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:34.050
Aw, we're gonna get nowhere if he's this defiant right off the bat.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.920
Let's get out of here.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.680
Just a moment, please!

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.680
I'll hear what you have to say, if that's all right.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.350
"Episode 15: The Blacksmith's Dream"

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.150
The sound of his work is rhythmic.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.530
Did Vulcan make everything around here?

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.110
Pretty much.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.240
There's stuff from his father and grandfather, too, though.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.950
Yu, was it? Does Vulcan make you run his errands for him?

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.460
Of course he doesn't make me.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:12.040
I'm sort of Vulcan's self-styled apprentice.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.460
I've always loved tinkering with machines,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.210
and after falling in love with Vulcan's skill,

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.130
I ended up supporting him with his work.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.310
Although lately, I am more like his gofer.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.310
Hm? It wasn't like this before?

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.350
Vulcan's skill is the real deal.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.730
His security, the precision of his work, his speed, his creativity...

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.360
He has everything a craftsman needs.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.120
His taste in skulls may be a bit troubling, though.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:50.460
So he gets a lot of recruiters from Haijima and the Fire Force.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.170
But Vulcan sends away every last one of them.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.050
As a result, thanks to some doing by Haijima, who was not amused by this,

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.300
the merchants that were once providing materials to Vulcan

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.720
have now all stopped doing so.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.480
That's where I come in,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.690
running around to different junk dealers to collect his materials.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.110
No wonder he hates Haijima.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.030
Still, it seems like there's some other reason

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.160
for Vulcan's hatred of Haijima and the Fire Force.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.990
The 8th isn't like the other companies. I guarantee it.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.790
So, can I ask you to at least get Vulcan to hear what we have to say?

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:40.510
You're from the Fire Force, but you're not like all the others before you.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.930
All right. With that in mind...

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.400
You're sure about coming in without asking first?

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.150
I may have Vulcan getting mad at me, but... Eep!

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.160
Wait, this is a machine?

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.330
"Stinging"
Ow! Was that a knuckleball?!

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.040
Another machine?!

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.330
This is Lisa-san. She lives with Vulcan-san.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.500
Hey, Yu!

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.920
Don't go letting the Special Fire Force in here!

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.590
Ow! You're hurting me!

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.930
He's putting that together with awesome speed.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.390
Almost like he's beating on drums.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.900
Huh?!

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.400
Yes! Done!

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.700
Why did you kick it after you just finished making it? You'll break it.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.370
A machine that would break that easily is no different than a defective unit.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.040
And hey, who said you could come in here?!

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.670
Now, now, easy...

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.840
Hey, Yu, what are you doing?! We have guests! Bring some tea!

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.510
Yes, sir!

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.800
Oh... Thanks.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.970
As if!

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.970
At least hear us out!

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.140
I've heard more than enough Fire Soldier tripe.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.440
You've got nothing I want to hear!

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.730
Idiot.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.940
Vul, it's him again.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.950
All right.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.910
You'll be all right by yourself?

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.450
No problem.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.050
"Special Fire Force Company 3" "Captain" "Dr. Giovanni"

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.050
It's the captain of the 3rd.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.180
The 3rd is the one that's under Haijima's control.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.680
Haijima is going to snatch up Vulcan.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.600
But if Vulcan goes there, his dream won't ever come true.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.330
How has your work been going ever since?

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:19.210
You've liked animals since you were a child, haven't you?

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.540
That was a damn dirty trick to play!

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.420
You're the one who stopped the supply line to my workshop, aren't you?!

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.590
Do you see now that you can't build things with just blueprints?

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.180
Stop being so stubborn and come join the 3rd.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.430
We have all the material you need.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.270
I wouldn't even change a mini light bulb under your directions!

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.440
This is your final warning.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.530
Don't blame me if you choose to ignore it.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.820
Are you going to kill me if I do, like you did my pop and granddad?

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.870
What are you talking about?

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.120
You backstabber!

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.040
What a pity.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:07.010
Your genius will be lost if you stay in a scrapyard like this.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:11.470
Are you still carrying on about the world's animals?

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.140
Shut up!

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.220
It's a worthless dream.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:20.350
Don't you sneer at my dreams when you left for money and power!

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.400
If you were to offer your skill and talents to the empire,

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.650
just imagine how many people's lives could be saved.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.620
Your dream is so preposterous, it isn't even funny.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.620
You still here, you damn Fire Soldier?

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.420
So Haijima is exerting pressure?

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.500
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.210
Yes it does.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:52.340
The 8th was formed to do internal investigations of the other companies.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.470
We're not like the companies who are constrained by outside organizations.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.060
We genuinely want to save people.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.640
So, Vulcan, we want to help you.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.440
Where did that come from?!

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.150
Sorry. I touched where I shouldn't have, and it did something it shouldn't have.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:16.700
Don't touch where you shouldn't. We're having a serious talk, here.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.080
"Anticipation"

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.240
What does this do?

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.660
No! Under no circumstances push that!

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.250
Why'd you do that?!

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.250
Hey, this isn't stopping.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.630
Then hold it!

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.340
What's this here?

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.800
No, don't touch that, either!

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.680
Pushy-push!

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.010
The elephant!

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.470
What does this do?

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:41.850
Not this one!

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.890
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:53.610
How are you guys so messed up? Are you really Fire Soldiers?

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.320
You can't go back without accomplishing anything, can you?

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.120
I'm about to show you something that will make your trip worth it,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.960
so once I do, leave me in peace.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.080
What is it?

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.460
I haven't seen it in a long time, either!

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.510
Hey, can I take this with me, too?

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.050
Leave it here.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.140
That should do it.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.260
What is it? Did you make it?

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.770
I made it with my pop and granddad when I was a kid.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.690
Now, just watch.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.820
I don't ever want to make just ordinary machines.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.840
Did you know that long ago,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.390
there were over 1,750,000 species of animals in the world?

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:06.640
A-Awesome... Are these... elephants?

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.440
Are those...?

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.870
Migratory birds. Once, they flew around from continent to continent,

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.910
but now, there's nowhere left for them to go home to.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.670
Why is this?

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:35.670
I just can't... hold back my tears...

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.640
Amaterasu can only provide energy for the empire's people.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.260
So I want to create an energy source

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.470
that will allow the whole world to come back to life,

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.350
and bring the animals that have gone extinct back into this world.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.150
That's my dream.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.990
Someone who can use technology for lives other than his own...

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.790
Captain Obi, Vulcan is a good fit for the 8th!

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.770
Every time I see it, it's fantastic! Shinra-san, what did you all think?

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.110
I was impressed!

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.360
Holy cow.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.320
Listen, Vulcan, I'm sure you'll love the 8th, too!

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.950
Would you at least come and meet our captain, just once?

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.370
No.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.990
No matter what you tell me,

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.620
I'm not keen on associating with anyone who's under Haijima's thumb.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.460
I'll go my own way.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.170
Same old Vulcan.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.760
How long have you been with him?

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.760
I lost my parents in a fire caused by an Infernal.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.270
I lost everyone close to me, and almost got stuck into a convent,

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.810
but I'm not about to become a sister.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.020
Oh, sorry. You're a sister, aren't you?

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.650
Oh, that's okay.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.030
I... ran away from there.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.820
But... I lost my place to stay out of the rain,

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.620
and when I spent the night in this scrapyard...

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.080
...Vulcan took me in.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.170
He's a kind man, isn't he?

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:42.090
He's kind, all right. Unusually so.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.930
No matter how much more Vulcan has to look after others,

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:49.310
he just figures he can work that much harder.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.810
Whose grave is this?

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.390
That's Vulcan's father and grandfather's grave.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.440
I heard they both became Infernals at the same time.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:03.320
Is that something that happens a lot? Vulcan seems skeptical of Giovanni.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.740
Why does he suspect Giovanni?

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.490
Vulcan's grandfather had two apprentices.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:15.250
One of them was Vulcan's father; the other one was Giovanni.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.000
Right after the two of them died unnatural deaths,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.420
Giovanni went to work for Haijima.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.550
That's something that was strictly forbidden by their master.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.470
Forbidden?

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:31.760
Vulcan's whole family has apparently had history with Haijima going way back.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:38.480
I should be getting in to start making Vul his supper.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.020
I hate to say this, but you should give up and leave.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.110
I'm sorry I wasn't any more help.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.650
Don't be like that--

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:51.200
The time has come. Kill Vulcan.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:58.250
It's that same sensation as before.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.300
That time, it was Lieutenant Konro's cry for help.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.090
This time, it's Dr. Giovanni's hostile intent.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.300
It doesn't look like we can persuade him.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.220
Maybe we should head back to the 8th for now.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.890
We can't leave here now.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.100
Hero's intuition.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.020
"To be continued"

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.610
"Next time"
