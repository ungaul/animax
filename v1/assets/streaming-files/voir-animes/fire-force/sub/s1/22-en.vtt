00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.070
A long time ago, mankind was touched by the planet's anger,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.860
and the world was engulfed in flames.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.660
It was the Day of the Cataclysm.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.240
The flames burned ferociously,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.830
with an intensity threatening to incinerate the places mankind lived,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.540
the languages they spoke, and the culture they had built up.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.020
This is Yona.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.140
Yes, that's right.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.310
The crewmen from the 8th have been split up.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.900
At the moment, the two of them are still quiet. It's just getting started.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.490
Shinra Kusakabe and Commander Sho's second contact.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.370
All as the Evangelist has declared. Látom.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.910
Now then, I'm concerned about what's happening.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.460
Off to where Commander Sho and Shinra are.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.580
I'm here.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.380
Don't sneak up and stand behind others like that, Haumea! You startled me!

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.970
Commander Sho and I are not the only ones who possess an Adolla Burst.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.180
It seems like it's about to happen.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.390
"Evangelist's Subordinate: Haumea"

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.440
It has been 198 years since the Solar calendar was instituted.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.270
The Evangelist is pleased.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.940
The Adolla Burst is the primordial flame.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.370
It is called the Flame of Perdition, and is still considered a mystery.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.450
But you are now seeing this via Adolla Link, aren't you?

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.670
This unusual land, with its black ground and countless flames rising from it.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.290
This is the Adolla Burst.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.590
Then, Adolla Bursts are flames from this other dimension?

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.970
How do I, ostensibly still on Earth, have something from this other dimension?

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.770
Because it is an energy that can affect all other things.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.940
So then, what? You're saying that spontaneous human combustion

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.860
is caused by this strange world we're looking at now?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.320
The Adolla Link... What exactly is this place?

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.780
This is the underworld of Adolla.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.410
Those who witnessed this land anciently called it...

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.120
..."Hell."

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.170
Do you see who is behind me? This is the Evangelist.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.320
You're the Evangelist?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.900
You're the one who's using Sho to carry out human combustion?!

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.410
It vanished...?

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.210
Shinra-kun, are you okay? What's going on? Is something the matter?

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.010
Through the grace of the Evangelist,

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.680
I can affect all things.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.760
Your Adolla Burst cannot measure up.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.810
Yes, Commander Sho's ability...

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.060
It allows him to mess with the thermal expansion of the universe,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.440
and stop time!

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.820
You can do that with an Adolla Burst?

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.660
He is correct. I steal the heat of expansion and stop time.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.450
I don't care how fast you've gotten, Shinra,

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.420
if the benchmark of time itself is stopped, you'll never catch up to him!

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.790
Well, screw that.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.630
It doesn't mean that I can just give up!

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.640
Damn it!

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.110
No matter how hard you struggle, you look like you're standing still to me.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.190
You little brat...

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.620
It's no use! You can't beat him!

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.880
It is beyond you. You cannot catch me.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.300
What was that?

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.050
You cannot beat me.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.640
"You cannot this," "you cannot that." Put a sock in it.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.640
You're a real sassy little kid.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.810
What you can do is just once, be nice and call me "Big Brother"!

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.650
Aw, man, now I'm angry!

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.490
Just you watch! I'm going to catch you, right now!

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.200
Good luck, "Big Brother"!

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.820
Knock that off!

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.160
Now, let's continue our game of tag.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.330
After all, you couldn't even toddle around 12 years ago.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.960
This is pointless. A waste of time.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.710
Go on, start running, Sho.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.380
Your brother is "it," and he's going to catch you.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.320
You've never played tag, have you?

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.820
Hitting the person who's "it" is against the rules.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.330
I have no intention of playing along with your tomfoolery.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.000
You really are a stuck-up brat!

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.710
I didn't come here just for the fun of it!

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.210
Sho, Big Brother is going to play with you!

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.890
He forced a Link with me...?

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.480
Shinra-kun, have you gotten even faster since we came down here?

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:52.320
So close. I went faster than I thought, and my timing was off.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.950
What did you just...?

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.790
The reason why Sho's ability is so strong

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.830
must be because he has such a high-grade connection to the Adolla world.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:10.260
An Adolla Link, huh? When my feet tingled, my speed increased.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.630
Is that another effect of the Adolla Link?

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.720
The Evangelist... Who is it?

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.560
Are they even human, like us?

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.140
My Adolla burst will get stronger

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.520
if I receive the Evangelist's "grace" or whatever.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.900
But how...?

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.290
Damn it...

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.710
I've had a number of Adolla Link experiences happen to me already.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.460
There's no reason why I can't do it!

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.600
The way this is going, I can't hold out forever.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.060
Severed Universe.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.950
It's only a matter of time before you collapse.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.960
Twice now, other people's emotions have found their way inside me.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.210
Lieutenant Konro's plea for help...

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.460
...and Dr. Giovanni's bloodlust.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.970
Those... must have been due to an Adolla Link.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.930
Up to now, I've only been on the receiving end...

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.930
...but this time, I'm going to be the one charging in!

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.270
I'm telling you, an Adolla Burst without grace will do you no good.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.980
I know!

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.920
Shinra-kun, you should get out of here! You're going to get killed like this!

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.180
Why, when you know it won't work,

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.350
do you just keep coming toward me?

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.860
The image of your face when you were little haunts me...

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.280
What is the significance of blood relations?

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.030
There is no connection at all between you and me.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.120
I've been treated warmly by the superiors who are around me.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.790
In that case, we have no choice but to believe it, as well.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.290
We're going to form our strategy around the premise

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.540
that Shinra's brother is still alive.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.090
Things had been weird ever since you got back.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.340
The other companies ought not interfere with the 8th's matters.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.180
I'm going to track down the Evangelist, too. Let me work with you.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.310
Until you find something that's truly important to you, I'll count on you.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:10.770
He's the only family you have. Make sure to keep him safe.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.560
Rubbish.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.780
And now, I'm going to hook you up with that kindness.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:33.170
Look, Sho, to you, I'm nothing more than a guy who showed up out of nowhere.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.670
But to me, you're...

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:42.680
After I lost you and Mom, I never thought I'd see you again.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.890
"Just once again... If only I could see them once again..."

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.810
I've lived my whole life up to now thinking that.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.270
I'm not just going to collapse that easily.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.190
I can't afford to give up now!

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:05.950
Sho, thank you for still being alive.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.790
You're like a miracle to me.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.960
All I can do is keep going faster!

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.300
And nothing else!

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.820
What?

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.440
This is the motionless world.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.110
Impossible.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.700
He disappeared?

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.260
Another earthquake?

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.510
There sure have been a lot of them lately.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:12.640
I'm getting a case of nerves in my nerves. I hope the 8th is all right.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.940
Keep the chatter to yourselves.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.440
"Lieutenant Priest" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Onyango"

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.440
Right.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.530
I beg your pardon, Lieutenant Onyango.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.820
Sorry to call you out of retirement.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.570
What choice did you have, after Rekka went off?

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.910
Old soldiers can't afford to just fade away.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:36.370
Is your right eye okay? Could this rash of earthquakes mean...?

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.670
I didn't want Shinra Kusakabe to find his way here.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.720
Where did you go?

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.520
Do I return time to its normal speed?

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:59.230
No... It's too dangerous to go back without identifying his actions.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.190
But I'm at my limit.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.570
What?

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.120
O-Ouch... That was pretty fast.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.710
I went right by you, huh?

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:29.050
When did you... How did you move all the way over there?

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.390
Maybe I'm getting awfully close to your speed.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:38.390
Our game of tag isn't over yet. I promise you, I'm going to catch you.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.400
Sho, what should we play today?

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.950
That image just now--was that an Adolla Link?

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.830
Tell me, how did you vanish a moment ago?

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.290
Hell if I know. I was just trying to go faster.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.540
Shinra-kun disappeared from his world of stopped time.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.960
He just tried to increase his speed, and disappeared?

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.760
When a body exceeds a certain speed, it can no longer withstand the shock...

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.430
...and self-destructs.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.220
If it travels at ultra-high speed,

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.760
the body could break down into the invisible particle level...

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.690
But no, once a person splits apart, how would they come back together?

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.060
But then, Commander Sho is doing something as ridiculous

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.440
as cooling the universe, isn't he?

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.900
If they can affect all things,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.410
then returning a divided body back the way it was is theoretically...

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.200
Who is this Evangelist who can make these things happen?!

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.370
Here I come.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.080
I'll dilate the universe before he moves--

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.840
I haven't quite got control of this down yet, huh?

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.260
Commander Sho didn't react.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.770
Could Shinra-kun have moved at him faster than the speed of light?

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.810
If a body exceeds the speed of light, it would send time backward.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.650
Maybe after he splits,

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.030
his hyper speed reverts his own body back to before it split?

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.990
But if he moves about at that speed, it would create a black hole!

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.790
And if that happened, forget the Nether,

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.590
all of the Tokyo Empire would be wiped out!

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.210
Should I tell him?

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.300
Of course Shinra-kun isn't aware of this.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:37.100
No... I'll be able to witness it. This is a scientist's dream!

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.970
I'm starting to get the hang of this.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.350
You'd better dodge this one, or you'll be "it."

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.860
As long as I stop you before you move, it's not a problem.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.320
I'm a bit surprised that you could force an Adolla Link,

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.330
but it isn't a big deal.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.620
You've managed to let me stave off some boredom.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.010
He's entered the motionless world.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.170
Oh, I hit you!

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:19.430
How can this be? How did he come into a stopped world?

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.310
And with an Adolla Burst that lacks the Evangelist's grace?

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.560
It's the same as those times with Lieutenant Konro and Dr. Giovanni.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.320
If my feelings are strong enough, I can connect with you, Sho.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.780
You and the Evangelist are connected, right?

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:38.240
So, once I connect to you, I'm connected to the Evangelist, too.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.910
You're saying you attained the Evangelist's grace through me?

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.670
It's finally happening, Haumea!

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:47.750
Mm-hmm.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.840
The stirring of the Adolla Burst via an Adolla Link with the Evangelist.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.880
One might call it... the awakening of a fourth generation.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.510
While Commander Sho can control the universe's thermal expansion to stop time,

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.310
Shinra-kun stops time by moving at faster-than-light speed.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.560
So our times are the same?

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.690
Bring it on.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.380
I'm keeping my promise to Mom. I'm going to bring Sho back.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.550
I've finally met up with him.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.470
I am going to catch him!

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.740
I haven't got a clue what's happening. Haumea, can you see?

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.910
Hmm... more or less.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.870
I wonder, for every word or two that we exchange,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.960
how much are they fighting?

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.250
Not even I, who isn't human, can tell.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.590
Which one of us was the last one to touch the other?

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.340
What are you talking about?

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.680
Our game of tag. Which one of us is "it"?

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.430
What nonsense.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.860
Why are you so obsessed with me?! I am not your little brother!

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.320
What are you getting so agitated for? Rebellious phase?

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.870
Don't you show up out of nowhere and play at being my brother!

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.410
Hey, you, over here! Follow the sound of my clapping!

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.840
Oh, has your speed started to drop off?

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.710
Shut up. I can keep going.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.970
Looks like you're close to being overheated.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:17.230
It's over. You're coming with me to the Evangelist. Your flame is needed.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.030
Damn...

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.790
Shinra-kun! This is bad! Don't fight him anymore! Stop!

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:33.750
If you get overheated while using your ability, there's no undoing the damage!

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:40.590
Listen to me, Shinra-kun! Every time you stop time, you split your body apart!

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.720
In other words, you're dead!

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.430
Dead, you say?

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:50.310
Your ability uses your flames to accelerate you to light speed, and stop time.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:55.440
The shock of that happening breaks your body down to subatomic particles!

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.980
Accelerating even more, beyond the speed of light,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.400
causes time to run backward!

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.240
Then your body goes back to the way it was!

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.240
If you get overheated in the middle of that,

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.790
you'll atomize and die, and might not be able to come back!

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.000
I won't be able to come back?

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:17.750
What's so funny? You're turning my stomach.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.130
Back off. It's a nervous tic.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.890
No, it's not. I'm not smiling out of fear.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.140
I'm happy to be playing with you, Sho.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.940
Stop coming in like it's nothing. It disgusts me.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.780
No, Shinra-kun! You won't be able to come back this time!

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.450
Yes I will!

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.750
I'm not leaving Sho by himself anymore!

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.710
If I leave and leave Sho behind again, then I'm a failure as a brother!

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:15.100
Look at the imaginations in my head and I'll go back to myself

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:22.110
Forcing right decisions on me is like a devil that eats me up

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.910
He that used his claws on me

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.710
Uses the same claws to defend someone else

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.710
Weapons turn into both wounds and shields

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.170
Isn't that what life's about?

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.960
A secret known to none

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.510
For so long almost seems to disappear but never does

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.300
Been holding on to it

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.010
While spending a night in the fire

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.600
The more they're attracted, the more the ignorant laugh

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.390
What used to make up the universe until yesterday takes the helm

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.650
The entire range of emotions that breathes

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.780
Don't want to take away what I haven't even experienced

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:11.070
Look at the imaginations in my head and I'll go back to myself

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:17.500
Forcing right decisions on me is like a devil that eats me up

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.830
Don't get in my way anymore

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:29.880
