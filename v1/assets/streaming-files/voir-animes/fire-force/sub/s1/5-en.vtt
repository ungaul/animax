00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.660
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.740
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.360
Nee-san...

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.460
Huh?

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.770
S-Sorry!

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.740
Was she crying?

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.240
I really am sorry.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.010
Th-That's okay. I was the one being absent-minded.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.970
Take care with your training, okay?

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.680
Thank you very much.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.640
Well, if you'll excuse me...

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.060
Oh, um, Sister...?

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.150
Is there something troubling you?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.030
Helping others out is a Fire Soldier's whole purpose, so...

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.540
Thank you very much.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.890
The darkness is illuminated

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.520
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.230
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.650
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.360
The end is illuminated

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.900
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.650
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.030
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.910
Flames rise to show us the way

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.580
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.010
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.260
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.980
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.810
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.860
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.410
Playthings that make sounds

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.120
and magic that chases pain away

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.210
are all precious treasures to me

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.830
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.760
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.600
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.890
After that little dustup with the 5th yesterday,

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.230
you probably know this, but that bunch is hinky.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.400
We're going to investigate them, and it may come to blows.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.990
Captain Obi, that's no longer physical training--

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.450
it's something physical-training adjacent.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.870
Hinawa!

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.160
Our primary objective is to put Infernals to rest,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.090
and to keep the public safe.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.040
However,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.220
we must keep in mind the 8th's hidden objective

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.880
to investigate suspicious crew members

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.430
and find the means to oppose them, as well.
"Setsuko-in-the-Wall"

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.720
Like Captain Obi said...

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.140
I'm so distracted by his cap, I can't hear a word he's saying.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.730
Damn you, griffin! Attack my castle again, will you?

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.330
I'll tarnish Excalibur with your blood!

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.530
You really are an idiot.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.080
Say what you want, but please don't take down that adorable griffin.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.410
You'll be arrested for violating the wildlife protection laws.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.960
You're pretty dangerous yourself, there, Maki-san.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.000
Then again, 90% of the time, Maki-san is cool, beautiful, and lovely.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.550
It's just a shame about the other 10%.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.060
A shame...?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.970
Hey, you people, this is an important meeting. No idle chatter.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.850
Lieutenant! Please don't point your gun at us, even as a joke!

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.520
Do I look like the kind of man who jokes?

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.400
Huh?

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.320
Látom.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.820
My leg! My... leg...

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.740
There's nothing there.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.200
But how? An airgun...?

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.160
No, it's a real gun.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.170
Lieutenant Hinawa is a second generation, like me.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.010
He can't start fires on his own, but he is able to control them.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.970
He weakened the gunpowder's explosive force

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.840
so that when he shot you, it was with nonlethal force.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.550
"Weakened"

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.650
Unlike Infernals, when you face a hostile second or third generation,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.730
there's no telling what they might do.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.690
We're going to start going up against them, too.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.030
Arthur, you're an idiot, so that goes double for you.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.370
I'm a man who slays dragons.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.040
You'll have to find a dragon first, though.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.520
Training starts now. I'm going to push the hell out of you.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.510
Don't focus only up top! Watch your opponent's whole body!

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.760
Lieutenant,

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.720
I can't stand how the 5th would even joke about burning civilians.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.880
Who is that Captain Princess, anyway?

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.830
Third-generation Fire Soldier, Princess Hibana.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.070
She rose out of nowhere from Haijima, and landed in her current position.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.610
From what I've learned, she seems to have gotten where she is

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.030
by illegally researching Infernals and selling away her data.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.750
In that case, she might already know the cause behind human combustion!

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.710
She has enough data to allow an upstart like her to become a captain, at least.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.840
We're planning on using force to get it, too.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.670
We're getting into the 5th, even if it means violence.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.430
Your feet and Arthur's plasma will be useful to that end.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.350
Forget the data, I'm just in it to smash the 5th.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.560
"Special Fire Force Complex 5"

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.690
Please, stop, already!

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.080
Gravel! Gravel! Gravel!

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.280
Silence! Your body is the one I'm talking to!

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.780
Tell me everything about yourself that I don't already know!

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.250
Both you and everything that's not you is all gravel!

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.380
Lay the foundation for my happiness, you gravel scum!

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.670
It's coming out! It's coming out!

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.960
What do I care, you piece of crap? Keep on screaming, you nobody.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:16.010
Lie there on the ground for my strong, beautiful self, gravel!

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.160
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.260
The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.540
Ashes thou wert and art. May thy soul...

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.560
...return to the great flame of fire.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:42.880
Látom.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.070
I ought to know.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.290
That smile was strained. Did something happen with those 5th guys?

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.500
Hey, Arthur, do you know if something's up with the sister?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.920
What? The princess has appointed me commander of the order?

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.920
You look absolutely ridiculous when you sleep.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.930
What's up? Is something wrong with the princess?

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.890
Stop calling the sister a princess. Besides, what about Maki-san?

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.180
--That woman is an ogress--

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.310
--Shinra! --That woman is an ogress--

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.770
What brings you here?

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.030
Do either of you know where the sister went?

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.240
Huh?

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.740
"Episode 5: The Battle Begins"

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.400
I beg your pardon.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.120
What is a sister doing here at this hour?

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.580
Would it be possible for me to see your captain?

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.630
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.470
Please tell your captain that Iris is here.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.800
Something I can do for you, little Miss Have-not?

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:27.140
I'm not entirely sure what you're doing, but it's dangerous, isn't it?

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.110
It's also corrupt research that defies the great Sol!

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.150
Are those really your ideals?

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.320
Nee-san...

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.490
Do not wear that habit in front of me!

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.870
Nee-san, why?!

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.550
Sisters are nothing but window dressing for the Fire Force.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.840
And you've devoted yourself to this nonsense.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.800
Once a fool, always a fool, I guess.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.010
Don't talk to me about God.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.060
What you all worship is a hollow puppet that doesn't even exist.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.810
What we have in this land, and across the world, isn't God.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.190
We only have devils such as myself.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.570
Devils...

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.710
I'll use you to lure the 8th here, and then crush them.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.590
What was that? A mortar?

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.600
Something came down out of the sky!

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.800
Who are you?!

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.810
Who am I? Well, let's see...

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:52.230
I'm Find-the-Sister-and-Crush-the-5th Man, from Company 8!

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.770
Lieutenant! Are you sure we should be acting so rashly?!

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.610
The 5th has long been carrying out some pretty shady research here.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.110
It's not exactly like they can file any reports!

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.870
Shinra, you find the sister. Maki and I will take care of things here.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.290
Just the two of you, against all of them?

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.340
Once you get inside and start tearing it up,

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.130
we'll have more room to move, too.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.050
Go!
Right!

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.430
Arthur! Keep going! We'll cover you!

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.640
You watch yourself, too, Lieutenant.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.730
Here he comes!

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.480
You won't get past me!

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.490
He's fast!

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.080
Discount not; it was the back of my sword.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.160
"Discount" "Despair"

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.540
A-After him! Don't let him get away!

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.670
Don't think you can escape my discipline!

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.880
Run!

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.780
Lieutenant, as usual, you seem to be more merciless against people

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.860
than you ever are against Infernals.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.370
I didn't join the Special Fire Force, I joined the 8th under Captain Obi

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:17.210
so I could lay out the idiots of this land who won't listen to reason.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:22.040
You pound on them, too, Maki. Pound on them until they give you the location

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.300
of the spontaneous combustion research data.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:30.680
I left the military and joined the Fire Force because I wanted to save lives.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.640
So I'm not big on man-to-man fighting.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.680
You did hit that rookie from the 5th earlier, right?

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.310
That was just a light tap.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:46.110
That devil sure can move when he's running away. I can't see where he went.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.030
Devil's Footprints.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.330
Are you following the Devil's Footprints, too?

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.420
Who are you, old-timer? A conehead?

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.840
It's dangerous here. Go back to your farm.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.170
I can't have you snooping around the 5th like this.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.390
I'll kill you.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:12.850
Aren't you...?

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.890
By administering a drug I've been researching,

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.310
I've boosted this Infernal's firepower.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.830
I'm tickled to have found such a fine specimen.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:31.700
We meet again, murderer. I'll take my sword and... my sword and...

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.200
...my sword to...

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.050
Those small-timers from the 8th are too big for their britches.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.780
What is that?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.840
Lieutenant, get back!

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.600
That was some tremendous firepower.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.230
Heh, heh, 8th nobodies.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:08.230
I just blow some flammable gas into my zero-oxygen bubble gum,

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.740
send it toward my target, pop the bubble,

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.660
--Here comes another one. --and when the flammable gas hits fresh oxygen...

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.950
--Please stay back. --and when the flammable gas hits fresh oxygen...

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.280
--and when the flammable gas hits fresh oxygen...

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.620
...it explodes!

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.870
That's what's known as Toru Kishiri's Backdraft Bubblish Gum!

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.080
"Backdraft Bubblish Gum"

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.790
And another, and another, and another!

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.590
Maki, where are we being attacked from?

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.300
From that warehouse. The target must be inside. I can't be sure.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.780
That's good enough.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.310
"Ballistic control"

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.650
Lame. What are you even aiming at?

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.490
From the sparks generated on impact, I tweak each bullet again.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.450
"Ricochet control"

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.790
What...?

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.300
Pathetic. It takes more than this to stop my rookies.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.680
Maki, we're going to get these crewmen to give up where the documents are.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.470
Yes, sir.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.100
Hold it!

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.310
5th Angels Three...

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.900
--On the scene! --Has arrived! --Breaking in!

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.900
Have you made your peace?

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.780
Finding yourself alone in an enemy's base

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.760
shows that the meager 8th is as undermanned as our intel says.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:44.330
The Infernal that my research has fortified will reduce you to cinders.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.000
He's my new weapon that can focus his augmented firepower into one point,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.460
and then release it!

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.180
Leave neither a body nor ashes, now.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:03.970
Thanks to your drug, the flame and power within my body are surging,

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.390
until they're ready to come out!

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.490
That was close.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.530
Hey, you! Are you trying to turn me into knight teriyaki?!

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.830
Teriyaki? What kind of seasoning do you think you're basted in?

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.700
I alight upon the scorched earth,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.310
clad in golden robes...

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.210
Huh? Are you talking about tempura now?!

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.090
What are you, an idiot?

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.890
I'm a knight.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.020
Status?

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.060
The Angels vs. Hinawa, Arthur vs. the Infernal,

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.110
and Obi is nowhere to be seen at the moment.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.940
Like moths flying into a flame.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.280
Burn them all until there's nothing left.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.990
The truth and the intrigue behind spontaneous human combustion...

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.500
...are all the result of our research.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.830
I won't allow gravel to stand in my way.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.760
Are you seriously a Special Fire Soldier? You got cold feet?

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.510
You're not putting up a fight.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.140
Don't act like this is no big deal.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.110
What's the matter with you? You're only acting like you're tough,

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.530
when actually, you're ridiculously weak! And stupid!

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.740
Why is this? Why am I not my usual self?

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.750
It's not a question of your manner.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.790
My Infernal's firepower is just too strong for you.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.880
There are chumps who just say they're out of the zone or whatever,

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.970
when really, they couldn't ever do anything in the first place, and run away.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.390
It's exactly the kind of excuse you bogus Fire Soldiers would use!

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.430
Bunch of moronic nobodies!

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.560
What?

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:16.190
The newly-assigned rookie can't even fathom how outmatched he is.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.280
Then he blames it on having a bad day. Pathetic.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.070
An idiot who can only talk tough, a knight?

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.240
Good one, coming from a behind-in-the-count loser!

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.160
I'm not just a knight; I'm the Knight King!

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.250
Shut up!

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.050
The least I can do for a nosy nobody like you

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.170
is to kill you while making you suffer!

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.300
Why? I'm getting no power at all.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.650
My left? Why, when I'm right-handed, am I holding it in my left hand?

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.190
Huh?! How should I know?!

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.940
You can use that excuse when you get to the afterlife!

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.540
Violet Flash.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.010
What do you know? I thought something was strange.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.810
What the hell?

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.640
He's ridiculously strong!

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:41.110
5th Angels Three Three-on-Three Triple-grating Slasher, ver. 2.3!

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.570
That's way too many... numbers!

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.040
There are more than just three 5th Angels Three?

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.370
Looks like that's all of them, though.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.500
I wonder if Shinra and the others are doing okay.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.170
While Shinra is dashing around, we'll look for their documents.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.390
In here.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.940
"To be continued"

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.820
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.860
and curse the unwavering present,

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.990
but words that simply hang in the air

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.750
are not enough to save you

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.050
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:54.220
between sights we never reach

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.430
and pain that brings no warmth

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.560
to make it to a faraway place

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.820
Given the hope that you speak of

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.030
or the ideals that you dream of

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:13.780
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.040
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.000
and curse the unwavering present,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.210
but words that simply hang in the air

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:29.800
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.850
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.060
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.180
I hope we can still walk together again

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.400
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.110
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:53.410
"Next time"

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:58.460
"Episode 6: The Spark of Promise"
