00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.180
Next stop, Tabata. Tabata. Today's Amaterasu operational rate is normal.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.220
We are running according to schedule.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.190
Attention all commuters at this station!

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.770
The train traveling between Komagome and Tabata...

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.700
--A fire has broken out on the train running...

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.160
--That's a huge fire. --A fire has broken out on the train running...

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.990
I heard it was an Infernal.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.540
Another fire?

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.060
You must be in pain.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.770
I'll put you out of your misery now.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.530
SFF!

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.160
All civilians, please get back! This area is dangerous!

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.700
You, too. Don't stand around here, step back, now.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.080
Huh? Aren't you...?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.160
Lieutenant! What are you doing?!

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.790
Oh, excuse me.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.840
0810. Let's put this Infernal to rest.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.750
--Roger! --Roger!

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.310
Sister, please begin the prayer.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.600
Right.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.390
Flame is the breath of the soul.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.640
--Firing special fire extinguishing shell! --Black smoke is the liberation of the soul.

Readying core-annihilating pile bunker!

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.460
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.710
May thy soul...

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.250
...return to the great flame of fire.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.030
Látom.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.010
Látom.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.680
Awesome. This is it!

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.960
Sister, are you hurt?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.960
N-No.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.290
Sister!

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.250
Are you...?

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.960
Yes! Forgive the late introduction.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.400
I'm newly-assigned member of Special Fire Force Company 8, as of today,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.560
third-generation Fire Soldier, Shinra Kusakabe.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.480
"Episode 1: Shinra Kusakabe Enlists"

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.860
So these are the Devil's Footprints I've heard about.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.670
"Special Fire Cathedral 8"

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.550
The newly-formed unit isn't in a modern facility?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.680
What a dump.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.520
Shinra, come in.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.640
Yes, sir!

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.450
You think it's a dump?

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.820
N-No!

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.460
Reporting in!

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.090
Oh, you're here.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.220
I'm captain of Special Fire Force Company 8, Akitaru Obi.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.050
"Special Fire Cathedral 8, Captain's Office"
Please stop training when you're introducing yourself, at least.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.070
Oh, right.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.890
Takehisa Hinawa, lieutenant of the ramshackle 8th.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.530
So, Shinra... "Shinra"

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.280
About this résumé photo-- why are you smiling in it?

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.240
Sir! I'm sorry about that. When I get nervous, and my face tightens up,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.240
I seem to have a tendency to smile.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.290
Huh?

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.880
Uh, that is... I smile whenever I feel tense. My whole face--

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.480
Sorry, sorry. You're just so adorable.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.190
So it must create a lot of misunderstandings, huh?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.360
Yes, sir! It's not that I'm making light of anyone.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.950
"Adorable"? I think the word you're looking for is "disgusting."

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.460
So tell me, Shinra, what was your motivation for joining the Fire Force?

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.460
Sir!

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.550
I came here to be a hero.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.300
Heroic ideation is fine and all, but Fire Soldiers are a team.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.280
We have to make sure to put cooperation first.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.470
A hero, huh?

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.300
From what I understand,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.900
you were called a devil, even at the Training Academy,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.020
over an incident that took place when you were a little child.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.690
Are you sure you're not just a delinquent with a bad reputation

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.030
who became a Fire Soldier to score a little credit?

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.880
And you expect to be a hero?

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:12.380
"Special Fire Cathedral 8, Shower Room"

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.510
Sister... What is it, Maki-san?

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.170
Earlier, you were swept off your feet like a princess

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.560
by the new recruit at the station, right?

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.380
When he did that,

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.510
did you feel it was the hand of fate or anything?

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.260
"Thump-thump"

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.270
Maki-san, you're usually so cool.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.270
That's because you have a girly flower garden where your brain goes.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.910
Reporting in!

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.450
Thanks for your help earlier.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.420
N-Not at all.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.750
Any hero would do the same.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.340
It really is fate!

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.260
As a Sister, and our loveable Iris, violence does not become you.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.430
Isn't it nice and romantic?

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.520
I adjusted the cuffs on your pants to go with your ability.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.730
Is the length okay?

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.990
Yes. Thank you very--

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.620
That kind of smells nice.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.950
Is that the scent of a damp woman?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.160
Excuse me! That's not what I was thinking!

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.670
Um, Captain Obi, it's about that time.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.140
All right. Everyone's here, so let's get started.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.080
Not even those of us here right now know when or who it might happen to--

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.920
the terror that grips every person who lives on earth.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.650
Spontaneous human combustion.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.570
One day, it just started.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.010
Out of the blue, people the world over began to catch fire.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.160
These victims of human combustion were labeled the first generation.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.710
This first generation, who lost all sense of self,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.550
and ran out of control until their lives were spent,

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.300
were feared as "Infernals."

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.050
Infernals would not cease their activity

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.230
until the core where their hearts are was destroyed.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.640
Or, in other words, put to rest.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.310
The Special Fire Force's mission

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.010
is to put Infernals to rest and save the souls of both humans and Infernals.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:39.200
It is also our calling to solve the mystery and find the cause of human combustion,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.580
and more than anything, to save humanity from the flame terror

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.300
as soon as possible.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.420
I'm going to be a hero--

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.340
No, I have to be a hero.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.430
"Special Fire Cathedral 8, Dorm, Unit C"

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.270
Mom...

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:14.020
Mom, I'm gonna be a superhero, and keep both you and Sho safe.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.930
That's so cool.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.490
Devil!

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.460
Of course I'm not going to take in such a dangerous child!

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.870
Now, Grandmother, you shouldn't say that in front of your grandson.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.430
Grandson?

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.320
Do you know what the boy has done?

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.800
And still... And still...

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.680
What a face for you to make!

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.270
I'll keep...

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.820
my promise.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.820
The alarm!
Shinra!

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.860
An Infernal has appeared! Be ready in 30 seconds!

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.680
Right!

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.500
"Captain" "Unpowered" "Akiharu Obi"

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.620
An Infernal has appeared in Taito-ku, Torigoe District.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.750
The site of the fire is a small factory.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.250
The person who turned Inferno is the factory manager's wife.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:23.010
"Sister" "Unpowered" "Iris"

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.260
"Lieutenant" "Second-generation pyrokinetic" "Takehisa Hinawa"

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.190
We'll work with Squad 4 of the Fire Defense Agency's Ueno Regional HQ

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.520
to put her to rest and to stamp things out.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.030
"First Class Fire Soldier" "Second-generation pyrokinetic" "Maki Oze"

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.780
We're moving out! Hurry and get in the Matchbox!

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.530
"Second Class Fire Soldier" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Shinra Kusakabe"

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.540
"Special Armored Fire Engine" "Code name: Matchbox"

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.840
Emergency vehicles are now passing through.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.220
All other traffic, please pull to the side and clear a path.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.640
Special Fire Force Company 8, move out!

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.440
This is your chance to be a hero.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.300
The Blue Stripes are here!

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.260
This Infernal seems to be especially aggressive.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.930
We're working to keep any sparks from flying,

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.430
but unless you can put the Infernal to rest, there's nothing--

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.680
Sister...

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.270
P-Please... Please bring my wife rest.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:04.220
Infernals are lost souls surrounded in flames.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.320
In the name of the great god Sol, I offer mercy.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.700
Special Fire Force Company 8, we're going in!

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.200
--Yes, sir! --Yes, sir!

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.250
There. All done.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.040
All right!

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.250
Now I can keep everyone safe!

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.390
Mom, look! Do I look like a hero?

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.510
Mm-hmm. Very cool.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.150
In there.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.350
It's almost as if this wall of flames is refusing to let us in.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.780
This place must have been very important to the wife.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.540
Mom... Sho...

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.720
Shinra! Are you okay?

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.710
Huh?

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.430
I'm...

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.470
I thought you were going to be a hero.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.230
Fire Soldiers do not leave their comrades behind and run away.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.690
When one of us delays, we're all delayed.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.610
The luminous blue stripes that ring our bodies

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.860
are the ties that bind friends together in the world of flame and smoke.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.870
Never break them!

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:37.370
Having a sense of fear allows you to make cool-headed decisions. Just...

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.370
...don't chicken out because of it.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.170
Not a problem.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.220
Maki!

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.970
Securing a path!

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.690
The flames are being sucked in!

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:04.400
Shinra!

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.650
--Shinra! --Shinra!

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.060
Shinra!

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.040
Shinra!

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.790
Hurry and get out of here! Hurry!

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.430
Mom...

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.780
The son, Shinra, was supposedly the cause of the fire.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.100
There weren't even any bones left from his little brother Sho.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.560
Did they say he was a third generation? They can shoot out flames, right?

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.140
Terrifying, isn't it?

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.040
I can't very well run away.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.270
It wasn't me.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.510
There was something there, during the fire.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.540
Something other than Mom, or Sho, or me.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.630
I'm going to find out who the bastard was.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.530
That twisted, nervous smile...

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.380
It's so disgusting.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.260
He's a devil.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.470
Ever since that day, I haven't been able to smile genuinely.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:26.850
Devil! Hey, Devil! Get up! Devil!

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.030
Blue... light...?

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.280
After getting stuck with a heavy-duty nickname like Devil,

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.620
are you this pathetic?

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.950
I was knocked out.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:43.870
How many minutes?

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.270
What? It was about five seconds.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.210
Are you okay? If you can get up, then get yourself up!

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.750
You okay, Shinra?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.840
Yes!

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.930
Everyone prepare for battle!

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.780
2110. Now moving to put the Infernal "Factory Manager's Wife" to rest!

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.610
--Roger! --Roger!

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.030
Shinra, Maki and I will draw her attention.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.330
Finish this in one shot with those feet of yours!

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.450
Right.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.870
Commence the operation!

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.100
Ow! That's hot!

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.570
Improved Type 2 Fire Ax thrust!

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.380
I was going to be a hero... and keep Mom and Sho safe.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.600
Mom... Sho... I'm sorry.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.390
I couldn't keep my promise.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.400
But I will keep another promise.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.130
Mom...

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:48.160
...here I go.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.380
I am not a devil! I have to be a hero!

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.270
There.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.260
Off you go!

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.890
Off I go!

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.320
Sister! The prayer!

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.380
Right.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.110
Captain!

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.320
Shinra! Aim for the core!

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.290
You are a devil!

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.800
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.050
Disgusting. What a crooked smile.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.470
The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.100
Ashes thou wert and art. May thy soul...

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.060
Hey, soul!

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.610
Burn!

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.910
Amazing. This is a third generation's firepower?

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.590
Return to the great flame of fire.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.300
Látom.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.370
Sister, i-is my wife...?

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.650
Your wife is safe. She has returned to the great flame of fire.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.320
Shinra put her to rest without her suffering.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.370
Thank you, Shinra. Thank you.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.340
Good work!

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.380
Thank you, Fire Soldiers!

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.910
From here on, you'll be the recipient of these cheers again and again.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.800
Very cool.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.520
You've taken your first step toward becoming a hero, haven't you?

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.020
"To be continued"

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.620
"Next time"
