"Tokyo Empire, Chuo-ku"

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.400
"Holy See"
Here is today's Meteorological Agency announcement.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.820
A record-setting short-period heavy rain warning has been issued

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.420
for the 4th District of the Tokyo Empire's northern area at 13:00.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.620
Any persons heading into this area, please exercise care and caution.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.710
Also, please be sure to keep your distance without good reason.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.640
--Subject marked; sending now. --Switching all monitors to trace mode.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.600
--Tracking ID identified. --Canceling standby mode.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.230
Identity confirmed. Synchronization of GIS and tracking ID complete.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.070
Error of indication 0.083; within acceptable range.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.570
Fire Defense Agency alarm control system activation signal confirmed.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.280
--Continuing to monitor. --Subject has entered Akihabara District.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.700
--Forwarding alert to Akihabara District. --Subject has entered Akihabara District.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.370
--Forwarding alert to Akihabara District. --Don't forward it. I prefer the confusion.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.290
--Don't forward it. I prefer the confusion.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.410
Commencing alarm system hacking.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.500
Kanda Fire Fighters requesting instructions.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.130
Stay out of it.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.590
Isn't Kanda under the 8th's jurisdiction?

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.010
--Cru-nch...! --Gravel doesn't get to weigh in.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.970
--Gravel doesn't get to weigh in.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.180
They're the ones who asked. What's wrong with me answering them?

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.730
Incoming message from Haijima Industries.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.730
Crunch!

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.310
I'll listen to it later. That's my research unit.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.270
I don't take orders from the main office.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.320
Crunch!

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.700
The 5th is heading out. Even if we have to step on the 8th's jurisdiction,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.660
we're going to secure that Infernal!

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.740
Object approaching subject at high speed!

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.830
Crunch!

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.200
Judging by the Adolla pattern,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.790
I believe it is a third-generation Fire Soldier from the 8th.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.850
Gravel from the 8th?

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.970
"Episode 4: The Hero and the Princess"

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.850
The darkness is illuminated

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.480
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.190
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.610
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.320
The end is illuminated

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.870
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.620
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.000
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.880
Flames rise to show us the way

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.550
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.970
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.230
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.940
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.780
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.830
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.370
Playthings that make sounds

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.080
and magic that chases pain away

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.170
are all precious treasures to me

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.800
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.720
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.560
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.940
"Taito-ku, Okachimachi"

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.940
"08:27:58"
"08:27:59"

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.440
"08:28:00"

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.160
That's all the news we have. Today's Amaterasu operational rate is normal.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.260
All right, everyone, have a pleasant day. Látom.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.620
Sure enough, there's no news on yesterday's incident,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.790
or the man known as Joker.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.000
Could the Special Fire Force indeed be hiding something?

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.560
If I stick with him, I'm sure I can get closer to the truth

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.310
about the mystery of human combustion, and the day I lost Mom and Sho.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.690
Pardon me for interrupting your discussion.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.990
The analysis on the ashes Joker used to blow up the training facility came back.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.200
Apparently, their main component is Infernal ashes.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.500
Those ashes... were Infernal ashes?

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.200
They're using the remains of the dead? Is nothing sacred?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.010
The flames of the original sin...

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.840
Turns out I wasn't able to tell them about Sho.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.210
Hey, stop looking like you're dead when we're in the office!

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.890
It's killing my own mood to work.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.310
This is Arthur Boyle, lord of Camelot. What is the nature of your message?

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.130
I'm sorry about that. Special Fire Force Company 8.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.410
Ah, yes, yes...

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.250
Yes. A dog? Right. Very well.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.540
--Hey... --What is the address?
--What? --What is the address?

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.170
--Why did you become a Fire Soldier? --Okay... Okay... Very well.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.880
--Because I'm a knight. --Okay... Okay... Very well.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.250
We'll be there right away.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.880
Hey, you two.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.680
A dog got caught up in a tree, and can't get back down again.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.350
Would you mind going and rescuing him?

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.810
Rescue a dog? Isn't that a job for regular firefighters?

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.690
We get calls mistaking Fire Soldiers for regular firefighters all the time.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.810
And you two aren't getting anywhere with your work anyway, are you?

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.530
I'll take care of the rest of that.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.030
All right. I'll go.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.740
With my ability, it will be easy to get him out of a tree.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.460
"Mr. Fireman, right here!! Up! Up!!"

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.960
Huh? That's not a dog--

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.140
so much as it's Mamoru-kun, isn't it?

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.720
Goodness...

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.420
Th-Thank you very much.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.150
What were you doing up a tree?

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.100
While passing out balloons during a function at the shopping district,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.780
some neighborhood college students "hoorayed" me.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.610
"Hooray!"

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.810
Why would they do that?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.040
Do you remember the serial killings carried out by that firefighter?

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.730
Huh?

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.150
The man who was a firefighter, but killed four people on a spree--

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.780
Miyamoto.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.050
Ever since that case,

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.850
people's discontent for the Fire Defense Agency and firefighters has grown,

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.460
and sometimes, we get picked on like this.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.270
So, what happened to this firefighter?

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.540
His verdict is scheduled to be announced today.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.400
Word is that he'll probably be found not guilty for psychiatric reasons.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.080
Thus, we find the defendant, Setsuo Miyamoto, not guilty.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.080
--Impossible! --The death penalty's too good for him!

00:07:59.160 --> 00:07:59.870
You scum!

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.960
Do you know how many people he killed?!

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.670
--Easy-peasy. The law is just a big pushover.
--You're letting him off because he's a firefighter?!

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.420
The country would be up a creek if a firefighter was found guilty.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.170
No sweat!

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.060
Wah! It burns! Somebody! Somebody! Put me out!

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.720
--Ha, ha, ha! That's what you get! --Get an extinguisher! Or even a blanket!

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.100
--Scum! --The great Sol has decided to punish you!

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.440
--The great Sol has decided to punish you!

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.530
I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:35.740
Human combustion!

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.570
Hurry and get out of here!

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.220
An Infernal just spoke!

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.730
Hey, your honor. How dare you decide what's going to happen to me.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.970
But I said you were innocent and set you free, didn't I?

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.100
Shut up! I'm the one doing the judging now!

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.900
Captain Obi! About the Infernal in Taito-ku, Ueno District...

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.360
He has a sense of self?

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.150
Fascinating. I want him, whatever it takes.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.580
Crunch!

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.500
--To the control room! --Crunch...

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.640
Where are Shinra and Arthur?

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.180
An Infernal has appeared.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.100
Emergency vehicles are now passing through.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.060
All other traffic, please pull to the side and clear a path.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.060
An emergency dispatch?

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.130
The Matchbox!

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.910
Shinra! Arthur! I know you're in the area!

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.400
Wander out without permission, will you?!

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.660
When we get back, you're getting disciplined until you can't move anymore!

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.420
--Huh?! --Huh?!

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.330
I'm sorry, both of you! I'm sorry!

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.000
--I couldn't tell him I sent you. I'll do anything. Ramen is on me. Forgive me--

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.750
--Maki-san, what's the matter? --I couldn't tell him I sent you. I'll do anything. Ramen is on me. Forgive me--

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.090
Mamoru-kun, I'm sorry, but you have to take over!

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.770
Látom.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.600
See you, Arthur! I'm going on ahead!

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.310
Ah! What are you doing?!

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.390
Take me with you.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.680
Hiyo Silver!

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.820
Why, you... I'm honestly, seriously... honestly...

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.490
...seriously...

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.290
Shinra! Arthur!

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.970
What are you doing?! This is a public road!

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:02.010
N-Never mind about that, an Infernal has appeared, right?

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.740
A murder defendant at Ueno District Court has become an Infernal.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.020
He's apparently attacking people right now.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.730
You two hurry on ahead to the scene!

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.650
Yes, sir!

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.230
Saving lives is your top priority!

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:16.830
Roger!

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.200
"Ueno District Courthouse"

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:38.020
I am your lawyer! I'm on your side, right?

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:44.590
That's right. As a firefighter, I used to save people like this.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.850
I just saved your life.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.850
One might say that it now belongs to me, right?

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.860
That means I can do whatever I want with you, right?

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.550
Stop that!

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.820
God have mercy!

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.540
What the hell--

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.000
What the hell--

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.510
What the hell is your problem?!

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.550
Because of you, Mamoru-kun got hoorayed up into a tree!

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.550
Yeah!

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.510
Huh? That's your beef?

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.060
Ah, so you're Special Fire Soldiers.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.810
You're a murderous gang of bogus helper-men, aren't you?

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.020
How nice. I'm a bit jealous.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.900
We're here, too!

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.990
Sputter Comet!

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.200
Sputter Comet-san!

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:51.620
He really is speaking, huh? Is his sense of self intact?

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.330
When one's attachment to life and will is strong enough,

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.670
their character in life still remains,

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.220
but I've never seen it go this far.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.090
So there's no way to escape, eh? All right! I surrender!

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.180
What?

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.390
If you're not a murderous gang, then you'll let me off, right?

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:16.190
I was found not guilty at my trial. You can't very well kill me. Right?

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.610
Unfortunately, I'm not so good-natured as to pardon scum like you.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.400
You really are a gang of murderers!

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.750
Damn.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.420
I'm gonna go around killing people the way you guys kill Infernals!

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.960
Captain Obi!

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.050
After him, Shinra! You're the only one who can catch up to him!

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.510
But, sir, he's... self-aware.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:54.480
He's no longer human. I know how you feel, but...

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.780
Captain...

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:57.940
Shinra...

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.910
...pay no heed to what he says.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:03.990
Dispose of him.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.650
Okay, get going!

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:07.400
Yes, sir!

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.620
Dispose of... Put to rest... someone who's self-aware...

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.580
Hinawa, I'm sorry.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.000
It's okay.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.160
Please always remain our shining light.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.220
"Taito-ku, Ueno"

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:28.840
"13:54:46"
"13:54:47"

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.260
"13:54:48"

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.510
If I don't do this, other innocent people are going to get hurt.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.080
I'll do it!

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.510
I'll put him to rest!

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.070
"Taito-ku, Akihabara"

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:53.780
It's an Infernal!

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.290
--Get away from him! --This city is almost like a toy box. Who should I play with?

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:00.040
--This city is almost like a toy box. Who should I play with?

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.290
Interrupt my good time, will you?

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.810
Do you have any idea how many people I rescued in my firefighter days?

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.770
You can't fault me for killing a few of them in my Infernal days, right?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.980
You killed them during your firefighter days, too, didn't you?

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.450
Can't you do addition and subtraction, you idiot?

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.410
Those don't balance out the number I saved, you idiot!

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.910
Who is this guy?

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.390
What is your deal, man?

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.410
Y-You're the devil...

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.920
Wrong.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.100
I'm a hero!

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.240
"Onoden"

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:18.160
Observed a second Adolla Burst from the subject rookie.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.750
That rookie is the real jackpot.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.880
But it would be a waste to extinguish an Infernal with a sense of self.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.910
Move to retrieve him!

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.960
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.180
The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.220
W-Wait! Hold on a second!

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.770
I can't offer a sister's prayer, but this is good enough for you.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.390
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.810
I-I'm still afraid to die!

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:50.110
At least let my end be met with a sister's prayer of peace! Please!

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.830
Aw, what the hell. The sister and the others are probably headed here now.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.080
Until they get here, stay still and repent.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.790
Yeah, I'll do that.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.800
Irredeemable scum.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.260
Damn you! Hero my ass!

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.680
Shut up! You shut your mouth! I'm putting you to rest!

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.400
Special Fire Force Company 5 Captain, Princess Hibana.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.490
"Captain" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Princess Hibana"

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.620
The 5th will dispose of this Infernal.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.850
Hey, what is this?! Let me go!

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:47.330
Take him away!

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.920
Yes, ma'am!

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.170
Hold it! The 8th is putting him to rest!

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.380
Don't try to swoop in and do whatever you feel like!

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.090
I am a captain. Are you defying me?

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.470
You are not my superior!

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.280
Damn it.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.310
What the hell did you do?

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.270
You low-level 8th gravel grit.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.030
Gravel should lie spread on the ground like gravel.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.410
None of the crunch, crunch, crunch of your fussing.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.990
The only time you make a sound is when I step on you, gravel grit.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.560
Lick it.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.210
You people at the 5th are a bit domineering, aren't you?

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.420
I said lick it.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.770
I'm speaking to you seriously!

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.220
Hold him down!

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.480
--5th's Angels Three, on the scene! --5th's Angels Three, on the scene!

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.190
Out of the way! Move!

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.410
Hey! Fire Soldiers are supposed to keep the people safe, right?

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.660
What are you guys at the 5th doing?!

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.710
It's one kid who fell on his caboose. It's not like he got burned.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.340
You'd even joke about burning a kid, lady?

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:25.930
Ho...

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.440
Let me show you what a Fire Soldier is.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.400
Bring it on, 5th!

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:36.150
I, Shinra Kusakabe, Second Class Fire Soldier from the 8th, will take you on!

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.970
This ought to be good.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.070
Shinra!

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:56.420
It's unusual for an Infernal to be as self-aware as this one.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.300
It would also be a waste to dispose of him like this.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.810
The 5th will secure him.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.800
This is the 8th's jurisdiction.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.850
Don't you think you're being a bit presumptuous?

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.810
The moment he Infernalized, he became officially deceased,

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.600
and putting him to rest will return him to ashes.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.190
That being the case, I see no problem in taking his body in as-is.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.070
Besides, the 8th is a new facility;

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.410
I understand you don't even have a science team.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.240
This is a precious specimen.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.290
Wouldn't taking him back to the 5th represent an important step

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:33.460
toward solving the mystery of human combustion?

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.050
You intend to share the results of your investigation with us, yes?

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.130
Absolutely I will!

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.240
Very well.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.900
The 5th can take over from here.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.480
Whoo, how lame.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:53.290
Huh?

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.980
"Second Class Fire Soldier" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Toru Kishiri"

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.280
The captain of the 8th is a no-talent nobody, right?

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.110
Seriously lame.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.990
--What did you say?! --You wanna go?!

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.950
Now Captain Nobody's flunkies are butting in. Second-class nobodies.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.210
--Shinra! Arthur! --Why, you! I'll teach you! --You're screwing with the wrong man!

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.750
--Why, you! I'll teach you! --You're screwing with the wrong man!

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:37.810
Obi, if a Fire Soldier starts sticking his nose in too deep,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.220
it won't be the fire, but himself, that gets extinguished.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.270
You don't say. So I'm blowing smoke in others' faces, am I?

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:48.690
Then again,

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.480
the flames of the 8th won't be put out so easily.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.350
Special Fire Force Company 5, we're heading home!

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.980
"To be continued"

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.860
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.910
and curse the unwavering present,

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.030
but words that simply hang in the air

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.790
are not enough to save you

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.100
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.260
between sights we never reach

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.480
and pain that brings no warmth

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.610
to make it to a faraway place

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.860
Given the hope that you speak of

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.070
or the ideals that you dream of

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:13.830
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.080
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.040
and curse the unwavering present,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.250
but words that simply hang in the air

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:29.840
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.890
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.100
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.230
I hope we can still walk together again

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.440
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.150
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.570
"Next time"
