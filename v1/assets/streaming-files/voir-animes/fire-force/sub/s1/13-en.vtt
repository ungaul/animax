Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.490
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.010
Day... is breaking.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.860
Konro!

"Solar Year 196--Tokyo, Asakusa"

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.050
Are you okay? Where is that Infernal?

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:20.010
Yeah, Beni... I made it... You've carbonized, you know.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.940
How come? If I'd fought with you,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.730
you wouldn't have had to get this beaten up.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.530
Why didn't you let me fight, too?

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.910
Beni, we can't afford to lose you at a time like this.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.580
You dumbass!

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.750
We're all still here because of you!

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.250
Now that you've ended up like this, who's gonna be in charge of Asakusa?!

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.970
You're going to, Benimaru.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.550
--Look and make sure there are no civilians buried under the houses!

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.850
--The Special Fire Force. --Look and make sure there are no civilians buried under the houses!

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.680
--The Special Fire Force. --There may still be Infernals around, too!

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.020
--They show up after it's all over. --There may still be Infernals around, too!

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.390
Those could collapse at any time! Watch yourselves!

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.320
I'm Soichiro Hague, captain of Special Fire Force Company 4.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.410
"Special Fire Force Company 4" "Captain" "Soichiro Hague"

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.920
Konro-kun, right? You're the neighborhood watch representative?

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.210
By order of the emperor, the Asakusa hikeshis

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.090
are hereby formally inducted into the Special Fire Force as Company 7.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.220
You're just afraid of what we can do!

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.390
Beni, hold on a second.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.560
We'll be the 7th? What's in it for us?

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.690
Once you're an official company of the empire, you'll be supported financially,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.440
as well as given equipment, supplies, and top-notch personnel.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.780
I do not see any reason for you to decline.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.580
I can't answer you immediately. Let me consider it.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.970
It will be comforting to have tough men like you on our side.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.470
I'm looking forward to your favorable response.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.350
You're thinking of becoming an imperial dog?!

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.730
If we could have operated as an official company,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.570
the damage we suffered this time around might have been a bit lower.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.570
If the empire means to exploit us, we can just exploit the empire right back.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.460
"Solar Year 198"

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.460
"Tokyo, Asakusa"

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.640
The fact that my body has gotten like this is on me.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.930
Waka has nothing to be concerned about.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.270
You went to that length for Captain Shinmon?

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.230
Waka is the person who should be in charge.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.360
I have no regrets sacrificing my body to intercede, either.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.910
You men know what I mean, right? If it means supporting Waka,

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.330
I'll offer my two-bit life as many times as I need to.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.040
You shouldn't do that, sir.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.380
For almost as long as I can remember, my family...

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.760
...and everything else I held dear has been lost.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.310
So to me, there are no two-bit lives, or even high-priced ones.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.770
Everyone's life is precious.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.440
I want to be a hero that saves everyone!

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.530
Lieutenant Konro, before you decide to give your life away,

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.360
please use me!

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.160
I want to be of help!

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.380
Thanks. I appreciate how you feel.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.090
Until you find something that's truly important to you, I'll count on you.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.800
Important to me?

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.600
I feel much better after staying here and talking to you,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.730
but I can't lie around all day. I'm going to go do some interviews, too.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.230
Is there no way that we can help with the investigation?

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.150
It won't bother me.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.320
As long as I'm there, it shouldn't be a problem.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.540
I found you!

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.290
--Are you still going to pretend you weren't horsing around with my Kanna?! --You just got through telling me to, remember?!

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.460
What are you saying?! Why would I tell you to throw out my shoes?!

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.750
What's going on here?

"Episode 13: The Trap Is Set"

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.810
The darkness is illuminated

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.440
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.150
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.570
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.230
The end is illuminated

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.820
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.570
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.950
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.790
Flames rise to show us the way

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:44.460
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.930
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.180
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.890
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:06.730
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.780
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.330
Playthings that make sounds

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.040
and magic that chases pain away

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.120
are all precious treasures to me

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.750
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.680
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.510
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.440
How many times do I have to say it?! I'm innocent!

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.980
The hell you are! I was there and I saw you steal it!

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.070
Are you sure it was him?

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.320
Yeah, no doubt about it.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.910
I saw you walking around with another woman!

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.200
I'm telling you, it wasn't me!

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.830
What the hell is going on?

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.000
There's no way there could be this many cases of mistaken identity in one night.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.170
Hey, you!

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.880
What are you giving me that face for?!

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.550
No, what's your problem?!

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.050
--You little stink! --You little stink!

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.840
Come on now, you two... Hey, stop that.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.760
It's unusual for Hika and Hina to fight.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.810
--Huh?! --Huh?!

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.930
She's not Hika! She's someone that's not Hika!

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.560
She's not Hina! She's someone that's not Hina!

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.690
What are they talking about?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.860
How can you say she even looks like Hikage? Come on, are you dense?!

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.440
Who are you, then, you big jerk?!

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.200
What the hell did you do with Hika?! Give Hika back! I'll rip the life outta you!

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.870
What did you put Hina?! Give Hina back to me!

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.660
Hinata, Hikage, stop it!

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.750
Let's play tag again, okay? We'll play nice.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.920
Come on, now, you two.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.010
Oh?

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.510
Yay!

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.180
You disgust me.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.760
Ah! What did you do, you rotten onion-headed knight?!

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.810
--How could you do that to a child?! --I thought you were a good idiot!

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.680
But you were a bad idiot, huh?

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.810
Look closer! That's definitely a tiny old man dressed up like a girl!

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.530
Are your eyes stupid, too?!

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.360
--That's definitely either Hinata or Hikage!

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.530
Is this something a knight would do?! --That's definitely either Hinata or Hikage!
--You're not just an idiot, you've up and gone nuts! 

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.780
Whoa, take it easy, there, 8th.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.590
Huh? A tiny old man...?

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.300
That's not Hikage!

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.050
I told you so.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.050
What the hell...?

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:50.150
Your face is my canvas. You're going from regular person to work of art.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.190
As quick as a dart, "art."

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.160
It feels great. It feels great.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.740
You'll be fine.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.990
It feels great?

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.830
I use heat to manipulate blood vessels, dilating your capillaries and lymph ducts.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:11.170
Then I utilize the localized swelling to change the shape of your face.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:17.630
That's it, relax. You are going to be a work of art.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.100
It feels great?

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.690
No, I don't like this.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.270
--You treacherous flop! Did you think your face could bask in the light of Sol?!

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.650
--Wh-What are you...? --You treacherous flop! Did you think your face could bask in the light of Sol?!

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.400
Zeal! Zeal!

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.030
Ah, the blood is starting to boil! My craft is a big bang!

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.280
Ooh, that's hot!

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.490
Yona,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:50.040
--My art does not betray me. Anyone who turns on me is not my art. As I thought.
--we don't have an unlimited supply of followers. Don't waste them.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:56.130
The bugs are ready to go. The plan is complete. We should get going, too.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.140
--We're going to turn Asakusa into a sea of flames again.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.640
--As quick as a dart, art. --We're going to turn Asakusa into a sea of flames again.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.140
--As quick as a dart, art.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.480
--Hey, you! What's the big idea, eating at my restaurant without paying?!

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.770
--I'm telling you, I don't remember doing that! --Hey, you! What's the big idea, eating at my restaurant without paying?!

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.230
--I'm telling you, I don't remember doing that! --Hold on! I'm not the one who did that!

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.610
How are so many misunderstandings taking place?

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.940
Is there a shapeshifting fox about, or something?

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.570
How could I even be at your restaurant when I was eating elsewhere?!

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.580
How the hell am I supposed to know?!

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.290
This is the same thing I went through earlier tonight.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.250
--Infernal! --There's an Infernal!

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.750
There's an Infernal here, too!

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.340
Hurry and call the Fire Force!

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.840
Not now!

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.720
In the chaos of the fires and the impostors, no one will trust anyone now.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.220
Then they will learn that Sol is the only thing they can believe in.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.060
Asakusa is a power spot.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.810
Someone compatible may come about through the bugs.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.980
Or perhaps another demon may be born.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.820
We'll take advantage of the confusion to hit the 8th.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.530
Here we go.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.120
Infernal!

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.370
Yo-chan has gone and turned Infernal!

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.120
Captain, let's help to put them to rest!

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.800
No! This is the 7th's jurisdiction. We can't take any action on our own.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.420
You want us to just sit on our hands and watch?

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.050
While we may have Tamaki here, who has undergone sister training,

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.970
she hasn't taken her vows, so we can't officially put anyone to rest.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.310
Besides, there are some here who don't wish to be put to rest the imperial way.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.270
As far as the people here go, if we have to die anyway,

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:41.610
we want to have Benimaru-chan be the one putting us to rest.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.990
Where has Waka gone?

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.200
The 8th will rescue civilians and direct the evacuation!

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.450
--Yes, sir! --Yes, sir!

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.830
Maki-san!

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.710
We're being sniped at?!

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.210
Kusakabe, that was...

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.130
Yeah, the same as the time with Rekka.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.340
Stay back! I've got this!

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.390
Can't deflect... it...

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.600
Transmogrify!

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.440
Maki-san!

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.240
I'm all right. Sputter came leaping into my arms.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.240
I'll draw their fire!

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.410
Don't do anything crazy!

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.780
Yes, sir!

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.740
You go, too, Arthur.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.990
That was in-enviable!
"Correct: 'inevitable'"

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.290
It curved?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.420
The second shot may have curved,

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.380
but it clearly came from a different spot than the first one.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.050
--Just admit it!
--They're taking advantage of the chaos to shoot while on the run. --Just admit it!

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:47.890
--They're taking advantage of the chaos to shoot while on the run. --Infernal!

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.930
--They're taking advantage of the chaos to shoot while on the run. --Shut up! Stop shouting!

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.140
If they attack again right away, the third shot will come from...

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.480
...over there!

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.270
Hey, what was that explosion just now?!

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.980
That explosion was mostly from my kick.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.900
That flame arrow wasn't about to be deflected from its course,

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.370
even when I tried to turn it aside.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.160
What's more,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.120
the third shot came from a good ways off from me.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.630
Are they trying to avoid me getting too close?

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:26.550
Or maybe they're luring me away to separate me from the rest of the 8th.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.220
Even if they are...

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.890
Arthur, you keep pursuing them on foot!

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.140
I'll direct you to where they're shooting from each time!

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.180
If you tell me left, or right, or east, or whatever, I'm not going to get it.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.020
Make sure you point!

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.730
Is he acting big about how dumb he is?

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.820
Let's go!

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.630
Where is the real Hikage?

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.930
Were you also the one who transformed into the 8th's captain?

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:16.720
People are untrustworthy. They lie. They deceive. They betray. They die easily.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.890
That's why we need Sol.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.440
I didn't ask you about any of that "God" crap!

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.860
I only want to hear one thing from you.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.280
Y-You're hurting me... What have you done with Hikage?

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.450
Huh?!

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.160
You proto-nationalist scum who turn your backs on Sol,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.920
I have nothing to say to any of you.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.840
A vial? Did you...?

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.310
Long live the Great Sol and the Evangelist--

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.600
The flame...

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.810
...is the soul's breath.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.650
The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.650
Ashes thou wert and art. May thy soul...

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.940
...return to the great flame of fire.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.030
Látom.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.490
--Látom. --Látom.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.240
Gross.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.370
Damn it, what the hell was that?

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.090
Was that one of those artificial Infernalizations?

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.590
Sorry for not doing that proto-nationalist style.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.930
No sweat. The guy wasn't from Asakusa anyway.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.510
Also...

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:41.730
We tried to evacuate the town's people, but they would not do a thing we said.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.850
We need someone who can lead them.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.900
Waka...

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.500
Hey! Don't go there, you people! That way is an inferno!

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.550
Waka! There are Infernals over there, too!

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.550
We can't stop them anymore by ourselves!

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:18.100
I'll see to the Infernals. Can you somehow direct the townspeople?

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.270
There appear to be people throughout the town stirring things up.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.810
Konro, what would you do?

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.650
Where are you? Where did you go?

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.630
You're not getting away!

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.060
It's no use. You can't stop my arrow.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.660
White-Clad. You're in league with the Evangelist.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.700
Hmph.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.580
Arthur!

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:29.580
Again? That sword has a rather strong-willed flame.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.500
Oh, no you don't!

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.210
You dumbass! Stay out of my way!

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.340
I was trying to help you, you know!

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.050
You keep out of this!

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.060
No, you keep out of this!

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.360
If you can repel my arrows, I'll just have to use exploding ones.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.990
Get off of me, now!

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.160
You just keep lying down! "Good knight"!

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.330
That hooded guy is still coming.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.180
We have to work together, or they'll do us in.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.220
You don't have to tell me, I get it.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.310
Even when I tell you, you still don't get it-- Hmm?

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.400
I'm Puts-Up-with-Stuff-That-Sucks Man.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.440
Hmph.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:40.240
People talk about being on the same page, but I'm not expecting that with you.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.200
Let's split these two up somehow.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.740
That does seem like the best plan.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.830
You've got the longer reach, so you take the hooded guy.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.580
With my speed I can get in close, so I'll take the archer.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.380
The hooded guy moves to protect the archer, so we have to peel him away.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.010
--Let's do it! --Yeah--

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.890
The reason why they can move around so well

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.600
is because their forward and rearward responsibilities don't overlap.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.560
We need to establish our own formation, too. Meaning...

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.810
Meaning...?

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.440
Like this, right?

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.660
You can't escape!

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.660
There's no way you're getting away!

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.380
Forfei-- Forbear!

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.590
"Correct: 'forfeit'"

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.680
Fall back, Arrow!

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.930
You can't escape!

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.190
A bug!

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.790
Beni!

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.000
Beni!

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.690
I don't know your name, but at least let me relieve your suffering.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.030
Way to hang in there.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.020
"To be continued"

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.860
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.910
and curse the unwavering present,

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.030
but words that simply hang in the air

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.790
are not enough to save you

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.100
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.260
between sights we never reach

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.480
and pain that brings no warmth

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.610
to make it to a faraway place

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.860
Given the hope that you speak of

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.070
or the ideals that you dream of

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:13.830
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.080
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.040
and curse the unwavering present,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.250
but words that simply hang in the air

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:29.840
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.890
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.100
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.230
I hope we can still walk together again

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.480
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.190
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.620
"Next time"
