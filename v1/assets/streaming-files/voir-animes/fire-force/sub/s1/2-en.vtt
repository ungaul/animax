WEBVTT

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:08.160
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.240
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.660
...is death by fire.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.770
So this is the place that's to be my castle, then?

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.970
The Rookie Fire Soldier Games?

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.100
It's a contest where all the rookies that joined up this year

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.470
compete against each other with their abilities, and it's coming up.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.640
You and the other new recruit who will be arriving today

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.730
will be the ones who are representing us.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.570
Today? There's a new recruit?

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.910
That's right.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.490
Um, Captain, will there be anyone other than us rookies at this contest?

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.620
Yeah. I'll be coming to cheer you on.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.120
There may be other crew members who know about that fire.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.920
Yo, Devil.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.170
What the hell are you doing here, you damn knight?

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.260
I'm here to slay a devil.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.970
What was that, you onion-headed bastard? Let's take this outside--

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.480
"Special Fire Cathedral 8, rooftop"

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.240
"Alcohol"

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.590
Here, Sputter.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.120
You really are something else, Maki-san,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.580
freely controlling flames at will like that.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.630
I wouldn't say that. I'm only a second generation,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.010
so unlike a third generation like Shinra, I need a fire starter to create my flames.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.530
That's hot!

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.030
Today's the day I'm going to settle this!

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.330
I'm going to show you the difference between our firepowers.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.080
Actually, who are you?

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.260
My name is Arthur Boyle--

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.260
the Knight King.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.670
"Second Class Fire Soldier" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Arthur Boyle"

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.510
Are you the princesses of this castle?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.570
--Huh? --Huh? Princesses?

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.480
Ah, you must be the third-generation Fire Soldier joining us today.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.190
Hmph.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.440
Shinra, do you know him?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.860
Yes. We were at the Academy together.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.570
I told him that knights were wussier than heroes,

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.060
so midway through, he tacked "King" onto "Knight."

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.870
Sneaky, am I right?

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:10.700
Hmph.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.200
O-Okay.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.670
He tries to play at being tightlipped and cool, but he's just an idiot.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.920
He's too stupid to come up with anything to say.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.960
And yet...

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.130
--And yet what? --And yet what?

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.800
Somehow, he's still popular.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.720
Ah, yes. That.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.730
Hmph.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.210
I'm the one with the stronger will, though!

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.980
"Knight"
That's because knights are way more cool.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.390
--Ah! --Kings. Knight Kings.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.230
"Knight King"

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.440
--Kings. Knight Kings.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.600
Shinra-san...

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.900
You're cool, too.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.400
Show me that awkward smile of yours, Devil.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.830
What did you say?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.480
What are you doing?

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.910
Lieutenant Hinawa! The new recruit, Arthur,

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.580
and Shinra have apparently known each other since the Academy.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.250
"Head Spa"
Sputter!

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.630
Fire Soldiers do not play with fire.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.240
Y-Yes, sir.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.060
So you're Arthur?

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.940
Yeah. Nice working with you.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.520
Hey, he's a lieutenant.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.290
Everyone is equal before the round table.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.780
Don't sweat it.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.160
Is that something for a subordinate to say?

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.910
Látom.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.580
Whatever.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.800
The Rookie Games are coming up soon, and I want to see what you've got.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.500
Use your abilities as hard as you like.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.630
Maki, take these two on.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.260
Huh? Who, me?

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.720
Is there anyone else here named "Maki"?

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.980
I beg your pardon!

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.180
Shinra will lead off.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.690
Are we really supposed to fight?

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.520
You don't have to hold back.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.070
Is Maki-san going to be all right? Those two are both third generation.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.490
That won't be a problem.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.700
Maki is an ex-soldier. She knows how to destroy a man.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.910
Well, let's hurry up and get started.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.770
Shinra!

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.070
I thought I was dead!

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.160
Isn't Maki-san overdoing it a little?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.080
Appearances to the contrary,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.830
Shinra is fairly capable of rational decision-making.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.530
However, being a third-generation pyrokinetic makes him overconfident.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.210
You won't get me like you did him.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.750
Excalibur!

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.250
It didn't go out!

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.980
So it's a plasma cutter.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.280
My Excalibur can't be dampened as easily as Shinra's flames.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.990
But a knight can't very well do harm to a princess, either.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.330
You're forgetting your knightly manners.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.290
Knights kneel in the presence of princesses, remember?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.470
You'll answer to me for your rudeness toward Lieutenant Hinawa.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.510
Why, you! So you're not a princess, but an ogre?!

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.560
Who are you calling a gorilla cyclops?!

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.730
I never said that! Don't you even understand human speech, she-ogre?!

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:11.320
Leave it to a flame-manipulating third generation to throw fuel on a fire.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.990
Don't forget about me!

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.360
Huh? How come you've got such an ogre-like look on your face?

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.080
Not you, too, Shinra-san.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.000
If I can't snuff out your flames...

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.170
What's this flared-up business, now?

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.330
Huh?

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.920
Excalibur, too?

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.260
Make that Ex-Sputter-bur.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.470
Ex-Sputter-bur?!

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.010
"Devil" and "Knight" indeed. If we follow their pattern,

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.810
then I guess that makes Maki a "Witch," doesn't it?

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.440
Sputter! Flare!

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.860
Come forth, Bobobo-bobo-bobo!

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.390
"Bo"?

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.500
Would you like to keep going?

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.780
What choice do we have? Arthur, if you say you're out, then...

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.890
Shinra, if you'll give up, then I guess that's that.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.800
Bobobo-bobo-bobo!

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.610
"Episode 2: The Heart of a Fire Soldier"

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.650
"Ippudo Ramen"

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.610
--I can definitely eat faster than him! --I can definitely eat faster than him!

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.780
Make sure to chew before you swallow.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:49.210
"Chew-chew"

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.580
"Gulp"

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.330
Pops, top off their noodles, extra-firm, please.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.260
"Watch us next week, too!"

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.810
--Thank you for the food! --Thank you for the food!

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.430
Delish grub, Captain.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.890
Hey, mind your tone.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.720
Yeah, glad to hear it.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.030
That restaurant is delish.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.400
Captain Obi sure is nice. Does anything ever make him mad?

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.480
Hmm? What's the matter, Shinra?

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.990
N-Nothing at all, sir.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.380
Okay.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.870
Training right after eating isn't good for you,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.580
so I guess there's no choice but to do some office work.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.170
Why's it no good?

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.010
I mean, he's already taken up with that idiot.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.680
"Special Fire Cathedral 8, shooting range"

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.260
So this is the Type 7?

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.550
The Type 7 Firefighting Ax.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.890
When you pull the trigger, a Sacred Spike shoots out of the ax's end.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.020
I don't need one of those.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.480
I have Excalibur here.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.190
A plasma cutter--

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.230
an ultra-hot, ultra-dense blade,

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.150
consisting of plasma created from your own flames

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.800
and emitted from the hilt of a sword.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.740
It's true, with pyrokinetic abilities, you might not need the Type 7.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.210
"Special Fire Cathedral 8, equipment room" "Special Club"

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:13.580
Every time I head out, I have to equip over 30 kilos of gear,

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.670
"Special Fire Cathedral 8, equipment room" "Pile Bunker"

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.210
"Pile Bunker"

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.210
"Improved Type 2 Fire Ax"
and maintenance takes time, too.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.210
"Extinguisher Grenades"

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.200
It sure would help us if we could hurry up and get an engineer.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.210
"Extinguisher"

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.220
"Type 7 Firefighting Ax"

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.630
Take some pressure off the lieutenant.
"Special Shield"

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.300
I don't really mind, actually.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.770
An Infernal has appeared in Taito-ku, Iriya District, sir!

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.040
This one's a fire in a detached house.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.730
It's conceivable that we'll have to put them to rest in close quarters.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.090
Shinra...

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.510
This may also place limits on your ability.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.460
Take the Type 7.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.430
Keep your weapons hidden inside your turnout coats.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.660
Under no circumstances display them publicly.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.920
This is a quiet fire scene.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:36.010
Papa... and Mama... Why? I'm going to be next...

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.950
Apparently, her mother also Infernalized two years ago.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.570
And now, it's her father?

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.220
That's rough.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.080
Captain Obi?

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.310
Let's do this one nice and gently for her.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.000
I hear there have been a lot of strange incidents at fire scenes lately.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.570
Stay on your toes.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.570
Everyone, prepare to move in!

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.570
--Roger! --Roger!

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.120
Shinra, Arthur, step over here.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.670
Didn't I tell you not to display your weapons in public?

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.400
Why not? There's no such rule in the Fire Soldiers' regulations.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.220
They didn't say anything at the Training Academy, either.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.650
Excalibur is my pride.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.680
Why should I have to keep it hidden?

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:39.440
Our duty as Fire Soldiers is to fight Infernals and put them to rest.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.360
Infernals were once human.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.320
While we may call it "putting them to rest," what we are really doing...

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.620
There are those among the Fire Soldiers

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.120
who consider themselves part of a sacred ministry,

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.630
and seek out joy in engaging Infernals in combat.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.480
But what about the feelings of the survivors they leave behind?

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:11.650
Those who are being put to rest when we fight are somebody's dear relatives.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.250
Never show your weapons in front of the next of kin.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.560
If you can't do that, then I don't want you in my unit.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.180
Yes, sir.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.050
He's right. If I'm not there for those that are left behind,

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.530
then I'm not a true hero.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.680
The flames have changed! Did the Infernal inside do that?

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.030
The fire is sneering at us!

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.060
It's hard to believe that an Infernal, with no sense of self, could be doing this.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.110
We're moving in!

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.690
--Yes, sir! --Yes, sir!

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.000
Infernal located.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.790
He's just sitting there quietly, huh?

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.690
Why is this happening?

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.860
Captain,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.570
let me be the one to put him to rest.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.490
Hang on a second. That Infernal still hasn't done anything yet.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.830
Don't be a dumbass!

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.670
The man is sitting there enduring the tremendous pain of those flames.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.000
We have to put him out of his misery, quickly.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.800
1706.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.520
Moving to put the Infernal to rest.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.990
We cannot allow you to suffer any more pain than this.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.770
Sister, the prayer.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.730
Right.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.360
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.520
The black smoke is the soul's release.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.210
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.000
May thy soul...

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.710
Return to the great flame of fire.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.010
Látom.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.430
--Látom. --Látom.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:05.530
Is that painful?

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.370
Yes... for me...

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.400
That's how it should be for you now. The most terrifying thing in this job...

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.380
...is getting accustomed to it.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.080
What was that?!

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.920
It's collapsing! Everybody out!

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.420
Captain!

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.050
C-Captain!

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:49.350
I don't know whose doing this is, but I train every day.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.980
This is taking things too far!

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:06.250
There's something funny afoot in the Special Fire Force.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.000
This is just a little joke.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.800
Captain, are you hurt?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.930
I'm fine.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.850
Could some malicious third party have targeted us?

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.440
I don't know.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.350
But there's no way I'll ever permit anyone to disturb a fire scene

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.180
that is still full of memories for the survivors.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.230
I swear I'll catch them.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.500
Though right now, we're heading back.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.020
I'm... going to burn, too, someday.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.420
Papa... Mama...

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.510
Mikako-san...

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.760
Your father valiantly faced the flames, and won.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:22.750
Your father and your mother must have been protecting you from the flames.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.840
That's what I believe.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.190
Papa... Mama...

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.960
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.100
This is about all any of us can do.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.850
Which is exactly why we're there for the survivors as much as possible,

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.030
and charge into a sea of flames.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.680
Go to sleep, Devil.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.100
There's nothing there that the likes of you can see.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.700
You're wasting your time.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.430
Sometimes you see things by closing your eyes.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.390
What are you saying?

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.980
If you don't know, then go to sleep, Devil.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.280
You don't mean...

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:34.840
...you...

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.400
Just showing a little compassion, as a knight.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.490
Ah!

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.470
...King. Knight King.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:55.900
Hey... What?

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.630
Don't talk to me just because you can't sleep.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.690
Heh, you may be a devil, but it still wouldn't do to kill you in your sleep.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.650
Just be grateful I'm a knight and go to sleep.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:06.590
Ah.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.090
...King. Knight King.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.330
Now I know you're doing it on purpose.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:18.230
I... We have to put a stop to this spontaneous human combustion, fast.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.020
"To be continued"

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.490
