00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.660
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.740
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.130
Pardon the intrusion!

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.310
This is a great chance to see how far I can go up against a company captain.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.770
But I don't see any chance of winning unless I can deal with that ability.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.900
You're not getting through.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.240
--5th Angels Three! --5th Angels Three!

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.030
--Three on three! --Three on three!

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.840
The darkness is illuminated

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.470
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.180
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.600
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.270
The end is illuminated

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.850
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.610
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.980
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.860
Flames rise to show us the way

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.540
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.960
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.210
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.930
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.770
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.810
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.360
Playthings that make sounds

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.070
and magic that chases pain away

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.160
are all precious treasures to me

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.790
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.710
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.550
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.010
"Episode 6: The Spark of Promise"

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.430
Iris, sit there and watch your allies from the 8th get burned up.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.120
Why, nee-san?!

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.400
Go ahead and pray to the God of salvation you favor so much.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.080
In this world, you either burn or get burned.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.420
I'm someone in the "burn" camp.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.150
You saw the other nuns engulfed in flames and disintegrating in misery.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.900
Luckily for me, my third-generation abilities manifested.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.610
I took up with those who burn.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.870
I will burn gravel lesser than myself to cinders until they are consumed,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.080
and stand on their ashes to rise even higher.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.950
That is what mankind's happiness is.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.120
Whatever you gain from doing that can never be called happiness--

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.590
You're just spouting your platitudes, waiting to be burned up!

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.670
You leave the sister alone!

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.800
The hero has arrived.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.850
I'll start by burning him up. Stay there and watch.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.480
Shinra-san, run! As strong as you are, you can't beat the captain!

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.090
It's all right, Sister.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.200
Things aren't gonna go like last time.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.910
Gravel,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.750
you haven't forgotten, have you? You can't lay a finger on me.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.960
We'll never know unless I try.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.710
Shinra-san!

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.800
Once again, you're on the ground. You really are gravel!

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.830
Damn, I'm so lightheaded...

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.730
Wh-What is this...?

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.810
Heat syncope.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.650
Heat syncope...?

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.240
Your body is currently enveloped in heat of my making.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.570
What?

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.240
That heat is making your blood vessels dilate and your pressure drop.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.290
The blood flowing to your brain has fallen sharply.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.980
That's making you lightheaded.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.500
For someone who showed up so enthusiastic about being a hero

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.960
to stumble and fall over a little heat wave is laughable.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.830
Lightheaded?

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.070
Oh...

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.860
Then I've got this whole situation wrong, don't I?

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.840
What do you have wrong?

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.030
You really are unsteady on your feet, right?

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.870
The palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness are all in my head!

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.330
Looks to me like you're just grinning and bearing it.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.790
Besides, the biggest illusion you're under is believing that you're a hero, isn't it?

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.390
Right now, I'm lightheaded in reality, and in my mind.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.950
So misguided or not, I can be a hero, too.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.850
Ridiculous. There's no way you should be able to stand.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.150
Compared to the drills Lieutenant Hinawa put me through, this is nothing.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.950
Fine, then. It's no fun burning up an opponent who can't fight back.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.030
Clematis!

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.620
You can be immolated by my red-hot flowers.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.500
Nee-san, you can't still be-- Keep quiet and watch.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.390
Princess Hibana, aren't you the one laboring under the wrong assumption?

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.230
What?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.160
Yeah. Tonight...

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.470
...I'm Deluded-Lady-Wakeup-Call Man!

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.610
You're saying I'm mistaken?

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.570
Could be. That's just the way it looks from here.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.990
Screw you!

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.510
So your dizziness is all in your head, is it?

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.680
You still haven't recovered your sense of balance, and you're staggering around!

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.270
Damn it!

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.150
How can you call yourself a hero like this?

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.610
Let me open your eyes and show you how pathetic you are.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.640
Sakura!

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.930
Writhe! Dance!

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.850
Stop this already, nee-san!

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.940
If you want me to stop, go ahead and pray to God!

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:31.690
You do know, don't you, that there is no God, let alone heroes, in this world?

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.180
That's not true.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.240
If you pray with all your heart, you can find comfort,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.990
and people have been saved by it!

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.910
That's not real salvation!

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.170
Then are you saying there is no salvation in life?

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.150
Yeah, there is.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.800
Exploiting and outsmarting others for your own success,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.680
and looking down on the foolish slugs from above.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.390
What you see from up there is impotent gravel, gravel, gravel!

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.810
It's fantastic knowing that you weren't scum, and were saved.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.770
The standing and money you get from being there is a person's salvation.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.240
How so?! You prayed with us every day at the convent, remember?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.470
Sure I did. And what salvation came as a result?

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.040
The convent took in all of us orphans.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.980
Every day, we devoted ourselves to God.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.850
Amid all of it, I was the only one who didn't take it seriously.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.320
And then, that day...

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.860
...the other sisters suddenly burned up.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.870
All of them, except you and me.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.450
They were all devout nuns, who served God better than I did.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.290
You realize, don't you, that nothing ever comes of our lives.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.380
The fact that I'm still alive like this is proof above all else!

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.840
People can only grow stronger for their own ends.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.760
Seeking salvation without growing stronger?

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.220
You might as well ask for the moon, too!

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.100
The fact that lowly gravel seeks salvation with everyone else

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.140
is misplaced in its own right.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.740
Princess Hibana, you're a victim of the flames, too, aren't you?

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.140
Are you still here, you would-be hero?

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.470
I have a little bit of an idea of how you feel.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.710
I'm someone whose life was messed up by flames, too.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.510
What can you hope to know?

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.380
Sakura Blizzard!

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.970
This time, bow down on the ground like the gravel you are!

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.400
I can't let myself collapse here.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.760
The heat syncope...

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.950
I will get back up as often as it takes, and each time, I won't be beaten.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.750
For your sake.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.210
Wh-What are you talking about? Are you losing your mind?!

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.540
Listen to me.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.710
I'm about to lay you out. That, along with all the rest of this...

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.970
...is for your own good!

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.480
If you want what's good for me, then burn up, already!

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.100
You piece of know-nothing gravel, you're spewing nonsense!

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.400
There are flames that burn the body...

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.610
...but there are also flames that light the way, and flames that warm you up!

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.570
There's no such things as heroes in this world!

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.990
Well, it's because there are no heroes in this world...

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.160
...that I'm telling you I'm gonna be a hero!

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.340
I am... Deluded-Lady...

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.840
...Wakeup-Call Man!

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.410
Wow, how pretty!

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.860
That's amazing, Sister Hibana.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.830
Watch this, Sister Clematis.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.500
When I add a little sodium solution, the flames react to it.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.690
It turned yellow!

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.420
This one is copper.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.140
Watch this, Sister Sakura.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.100
Calcium.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.490
I also have potassium, and strontium, and some others.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.340
How pretty!

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.330
They all look so great!

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.540
What do you think? Flames are incredibly pretty, aren't they?

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.580
Yes!

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.670
Sister Hibana, I want to be like you.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.540
You can control flames, and you're good at science.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.110
Iris! Don't hide behind there,

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.060
come here and have a closer look.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:17.460
Careful. They may be in the shape of flowers, but they're still flames.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.880
You'll get burned.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:22.590
See here!

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.320
Sister Hibana, are you playing with your pyrokinesis again?

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.700
Come now, everyone, into the chapel.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.350
Yes, Sister Sumire.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.040
You, too, Sister Hibana.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.520
That ability was bestowed upon you by the great Sol.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.320
Moreover, if you mishandle those flames, it can be very dangerous.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.990
I'm being careful with them, so it's all right.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.520
There you go, saying that again.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.690
Head inside, now.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.240
Okay.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.700
Um, Sister Hibana...

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.710
I, uh...

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.760
What?

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.530
I, uh... I, uh...

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:30.150
I want you to show me the flowers again sometime.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.250
I'll show them to you once you get over your shyness.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.450
Do you mean it?

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.430
The sound of someone's body burning; that person's cries;

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:03.150
the pain of the flames; the suffering, as their life burns away...

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:10.070
What do you think? Flames are incredibly pretty, aren't they?

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.330
As if...

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.220
flames could be pretty...

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.970
Let's go. We have to get away, or we'll burn up, too.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.930
As if this ability were bestowed by the great Sol.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.390
Flames are the devil himself, aren't they?

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.540
And since I'm able to use that power...

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.530
A devil should act like a devil.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.230
Nee-san...

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.060
...where are you going?

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.580
Iris...

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.270
Don't get yourself burned up by flames.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:21.090
I'll exploit them--people, flames, and whatever else.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.190
"Haijima Industries"

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.980
That's just a little slice. I'll turn it all over, on certain conditions.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.450
I want the rank of captain. And you'll provide me

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.200
with the platform and funding to carry on my experiments.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.190
Why?

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.630
When everyone at the convent had no one else to turn to,

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.470
you were the one we looked up to.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.930
You were beautiful, and smart, and you could control flames.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:09.210
When we were lonely and anxious, you were our hero.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:19.040
I didn't have anyone. The only thing that propped me up were my flames.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.120
But then, even they turned on me.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.110
I don't have anything now.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.290
You've got a hero, right here.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.480
Look up to the skies and cry out my name! I'll come save you anytime!

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:02.160
Don't be absurd. What makes you obliged to help me?

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.230
I don't need to be obliged.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.670
When someone is in trouble, I go help them. That's what a hero does, right?

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:21.180
Whatever the case, you beat me. I don't intend to fight you anymore.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.640
"Ping ping"

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.270
You think I've overcome my shyness a little?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.420
For crying out loud, Iris.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.040
After you come waltzing into this place all on your own?

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.040
I just wanted you to show me your pretty flowers again.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.550
I did promise you, didn't I?

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.480
Are those...?

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.030
Yeah. Irises.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.890
Nee-san, I love you!

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.020
"To be continued"

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.900
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.950
and curse the unwavering present,

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.080
but words that simply hang in the air

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.830
are not enough to save you

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.140
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.310
between sights we never reach

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.520
and pain that brings no warmth

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.650
to make it to a faraway place

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.900
Given the hope that you speak of

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.110
or the ideals that you dream of

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:07.870
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.120
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.080
and curse the unwavering present,

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.290
but words that simply hang in the air

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:23.880
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.930
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.140
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.270
I hope we can still walk together again

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.480
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.190
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.330
The guy in glasses... The guy in glasses...

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.460
Looks like you've gone around doing a real number on us, 8th.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.520
--Lieutenant Hinawa. --Lieutenant Hinawa.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.590
How am I going to explain this whole mess to the higher-ups,

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.010
or to the gravel still sprawled out all over?

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.800
Captain Obi was apparently going to make it look

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.600
like it was a joint nighttime training exercise.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.350
But you charged in before that could happen, right?

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.750
If you keep that up all the time, you're going to mess up sooner or later.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.690
I just had a great idea!

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.950
What if the 5th and the 8th all had a dinner party together?

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.330
Th-That might be a bit much.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.950
Indeed. That sounds pretty good.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:36.540
Huh?

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.630
Sometimes, when you're trying to game someone,

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.420
the more ridiculous the method, the easier it is to succeed.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:44.840
I'll say that in order to test the 5th's fighting strength,

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:50.550
I asked the 8th to play the bad guys and stage a surprise attack drill.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:55.470
Shinra, I'd like to set this up, so round up the 8th's people for me.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.800
You sure are being cooperative, huh?

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.240
Well... I've taken a liking to you...

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.760
Huh?

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:18.040
Chief, we're ahead of schedule, but we've begun our investigation of the 5th.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.080
Things may get a little aggressive, so please lay the groundwork elsewhere.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.670
Come in. Hinawa?

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.310
Yeah, I've been bogged down getting this off the ground.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.220
I'm on my way to you now.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.800
Huh?

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.440
It's over?

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.480
"Next time"

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:58.540
