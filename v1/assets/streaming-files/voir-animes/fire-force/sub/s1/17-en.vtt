00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.700
Raffles and his disciples used the flame bestowed by the great Sol

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.370
and the technology cultivated by mankind to create "Amaterasu."

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.210
The sacred flame of Amaterasu benefits the lives of mankind,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.630
and ended up establishing the foundation of a state in the Far East.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.320
Please stop that, already!

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.910
That has precious memories for Vulcan-san of his father!

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.700
Don't break it!

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.430
I decided to listen in on the bug I planted on Iris, and what do you know?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.310
Ker-runch!

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.770
Captain Hibana!

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.730
Hold still. I'm going to untie you.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.320
Please hurry! The workshop is in danger!

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.740
Maybe I'll just carry you back like this.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.870
Huh?

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.380
I really should have taken him back with me.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.720
Another one?

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.430
Arthur, status?!

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.930
Shinra, get to the workshop!

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.700
I found it. You hid it in this piece of junk.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.540
Vulcan, now I just have to dispose of you.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.050
I'm Put-the-Damn-Masked-Nose-Out-of-Joint Man!

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.890
What the hell are you doing to our engineer?!

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.030
Shinra-san!

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.030
Lisa-san, why...?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.790
Are you okay, Vulcan? Can you move?

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.040
I got hit by flames... I still can't move on my own yet...

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.090
Shinra Kusakabe... How did you get out of that?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.470
No matter. I'll just dispose of these pests and capture you again.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.520
You let someone approach the workshop, huh?

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.860
Damn it, what a hassle.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.860
My shimmers? Yes, unlike that fellow who went to the workshop,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.240
someone who tries to take on every attack would be pestered by them.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.740
Just keep letting my illusions distract you.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.540
Warmer air becomes lighter, while colder air becomes heavier.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.550
Shimmers are false images created by density variations in the air.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.010
Which means that if I add enough heat to blow those variations away,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.180
the images will naturally disappear.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.730
Impostors! Scatter like fruitless blossoms before my flowers!

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.650
I'm on your side... Gravel is the same all over.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.820
Shinra excluded.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.700
Rise, Fishing Fire!

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.990
Wrap his body up!

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.330
These flames...

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.290
My flames are magnetic.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.380
They latch on to the faint magnetic fields living things produce.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.680
Shinra-san!
"Our forest friends will come shooting out!!"

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.220
Sister, hit the buttons on the wall!

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.100
Látom.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.560
--Látom. --Látom.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.150
Good, Sister! Keep hitting them at random!

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.320
Látom!

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.110
Látom!

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.660
Látom.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.780
Látom! Látom!

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.870
Everything you made is pointless.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.920
Látom! Látom! Látom! Látom! Látom! Látom!

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.840
Látom!

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.420
I'm starting to feel faint from the heat...

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.590
Writhe around on the ground, gravel!

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.190
Are those... Did the sister start up again?

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.080
Machines, you see, have a mild magnetic field.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.380
I figure that if you get enough of them together,

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.130
they could easily get mixed in with the normal magnetic fields of people.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.260
It actually worked.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:47.150
I got careless. I can't keep up with him with all this gear.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.150
Contrary to the report, nothing here has been taken care of.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.320
Again?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.670
Are you the one who just Linked with me?

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.010
"Episode 17: Black and White and Gray"

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.030
You're Sho, right? Sho?

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.200
Y-You're my little brother, aren't you?

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.830
You and I could be brothers!

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.500
No, we definitely are! Sho! It's you, right?!

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.960
You and I, brothers?

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.090
Oh, you're crazy adorable, too!

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.430
Watch out for this ultra-handsome young man, everyone!

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.260
What are you, an angel? Huh? That's my brother!

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.600
Sho-kun, you're a full-on angel!

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.480
I can finally keep my promise to Mom now.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:12.900
No matter what happens, Sho, I'll keep you safe. I'm in your corner.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.620
I see.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.580
This is what the Evangelist meant by "you'll know him when you meet him."

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.880
This man is my older brother.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.630
This is so hard to describe.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.550
My only feelings are of disgust.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.060
When did he...?

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.520
Man with the Adolla Burst, you're coming with us.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.150
Shinra!

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.950
Amazing. You actually reacted.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.290
Arthur!

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.460
What is that he's been doing?

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:20.340
I can't follow... Sho's swordsmanship.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:34.440
Retrieve only the one with the Adolla Burst; dispose of the others.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.480
--As you command. --As you command.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.940
Where is the item?

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.910
I have obtained the key to Amaterasu.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.760
Shinra, get in!

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.930
Looks like you're no worse for wear.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.640
Inspector Licht!

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.410
Lisa, come on!

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.100
He's fast. How did he do that?

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.780
You're not getting away. Leave the man with the Adolla Burst here.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.440
What a pity.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.570
You can't have him yet.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.630
The hero arrives.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.210
Sho! I swear I'll come back for you! I swear it!

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.470
You must be Joker.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.300
Oh, I guess I've gotten famous.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.900
Whoo, that's enough to make even me uneasy.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.900
Do not interfere with us.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:48.030
It's no fun allowing either the Fire Force or you guys to do as you please.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.620
It looks like they got away.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.870
There's no point in me staying here now.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.800
Not so much as an Adolla Link...

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.600
What a monster.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.660
Captain Obi...

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.080
Yes, sir, I checked the injured from the workshop into the hospital.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.670
The workshop is half-destroyed, and we went up against the White-Clad.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.550
Dr. Giovanni is a traitor.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.810
I also met someone who may be my brother.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:58.020
Vulcan... ...may still be targeted by the enemy.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.190
We'll stay with him now.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:04.190
We'll wait here for you to pick us up and join you then, sir.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.700
"Operating"

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.750
Vulcan, would you mind coming to the 8th with us for now?

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.750
I think that's the safest thing for you right now.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.960
Yeah... Okay, sure.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.510
Thanks.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.640
I didn't want for you to come like this.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.810
I wanted to welcome you in as our official engineer.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:45.530
Even with Arthur along, we weren't able to keep you and Yu protected.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.030
I really am sorry.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.120
Your response was fast.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.200
It's my fault for not listening to you.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.460
You don't have anything to apologize for.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.550
Yu may be tiny, but he's tougher than he looks.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.590
And Lisa really isn't...

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.140
There's nothing in the world that can't be fixed.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.930
So Yu's not gonna die, and I'll bring Lisa back around.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.100
I'll put the whole world back the way it was.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.940
What about you? You must be pretty broken up about your brother.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.400
Don't worry about me.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.950
I don't think of myself as the only one who has it bad.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.450
This is how the world is, for all of us.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.660
Vulcan, you aren't alone.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:45.340
I'll work with you as hard as I can to make your dream come true.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.630
Don't forget that.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.550
Thanks, man.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.180
Actually, how is it that you showed up when you did?

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:04.520
Oh, you know. They were so late getting back. I just came looking for them.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.530
Or maybe you're the one who brought the Evangelist's goons with you!

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.370
Ridiculous. That's not true.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.080
In fact, it's because I came along that everyone was saved, right?

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:26.000
Any funny moves, and I'll stomp you flat beyond repair!

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.260
Arthur's wound was...

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.720
...unfortunately not as deep as I imagined.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.310
Soon after, Yu was out of the woods.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:44.310
Vulcan ended up taking refuge at the 8th, under Captain Obi.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.450
Sho really was serving under the Evangelist.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.780
But I swear I'll bring him back.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.700
I will keep my promise to Mom, whatever it takes.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.330
I'm so sorry about this!

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.380
Our rookies weren't too disrespectful of you, I hope? Dum-dum and Dum-dum?

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.550
No, we weren't.

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.970
No, no.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.510
If anything, I was the one who was rude to them.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.760
Supper is ready.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.890
You had dinner duty tonight?

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.520
No, the lieutenant made it, due to our unexpected guest.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.360
For real? Yes!

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.070
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.230
You can guess, Tamaki.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.490
What was that?! G-Guess?!

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.240
Wow! Thank you for this food!

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.250
I'm starving!

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.710
Don't take my stuff!

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.090
Where were you when the workshop was under attack?

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.170
Oh, that? Dr. Giovanni managed to get the jump on me.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.720
Don't let that happen!

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.140
Like you were so perfect fighting them!

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.180
--Of course I was! I wasn't going to let Silver's sacrifice be in vain.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.470
--Sorry about all the commotion. --Of course I was! I wasn't going to let Silver's sacrifice be in vain.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.850
--Nah, I spent all my time in the workshop, so I'm used to noise. --Of course I was! I wasn't going to let Silver's sacrifice be in vain.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.350
--Nah, I spent all my time in the workshop, so I'm used to noise. --What is "Silver"?!

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.640
--Nah, I spent all my time in the workshop, so I'm used to noise. --The point is, I'm taking that meat of yours!

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.900
--Keep it quiet! We have company! --That doesn't even make sense!

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.270
--Keep it quiet! We have company! --Just give it to me!

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.520
--Keep it quiet! We have company! --Shut up--

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.070
Stop looking at me.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.740
I'm not taking it anymore.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.280
Yum!

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.280
It's a good day whenever Lieutenant Hinawa has dinner duty.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.200
I'm liable to overeat.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.040
We should do better, too.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.550
The lieutenant out-girlies us.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.760
Did you get enough? There's more where that came from.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.560
Is it always like this here?

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:51.440
Well, yeah, right now, with Tamaki's lucky lecher lure inactive,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.230
it's a little better than usual.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.110
Lecher lure...?

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.530
This... isn't really what I was expecting.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.870
Vulcan-kun, maybe you heard this from Shinra already,

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:13.090
but our objective at the 8th is to save the world and its people.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.420
I like to think I'm well aware of your family's rules...

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.840
...but do you feel like joining the 8th?

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.390
You're free to decline, of course.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.600
We'll still ensure your safety from here on.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.860
So I want you to consider this openly and honestly.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.660
What did Vulcan come back to his workshop for?

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.120
He probably left something behind there.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.590
He said something about making a clean break.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:59.130
If he does become our engineer, that would be fantastic.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.670
Yeah it would.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:14.940
Pop, Granddad, here's your usual soda.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:20.530
I don't know if you're watching me, but the Fire Force is taking me in.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:25.620
I know you're not wild about it. I mean, the outfit is affiliated with Haijima.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.910
Am I out of the family?

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:36.880
I mean, our family promise was to never give any help to the Fire Force.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.800
Maybe it's our family curse for birthing Amaterasu.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.050
Everything and anything that's precious to me gets broken.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.560
I have to build something that doesn't break, no matter what.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.820
That's what restoring the world and bringing the animals back was about.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.280
I thought I could do it all by myself.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:09.450
Now there's Yu, and Lisa, and this guy who told me I'm not alone.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.330
I'm sorry, Pop, Granddad.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.170
I'm breaking my promise.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:23.010
"To be continued"

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.430
Cleaning time!

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.900
Let's get cleaning!

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.730
From here to here is your part, okay? Don't come anywhere near me!

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.650
No, Kusakabe, you stay away from me!

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.820
What's this?

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.450
I arranged it to make it more user-friendly.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.290
The old, drab church looks a little better now, right?

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.920
I got permission from the captain.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.290
Oh, that's kind of nice, isn't it?

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.130
Nice, sir? You mean, that skull?

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:30.930
Even among the Special Fire Force, we're in the position of outsiders,

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.850
so this is pretty rocking and cool!

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.930
Látom.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.680
I'm going to keep expecting more from you, Devil.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.770
I'm not a devil, sir, I'm a hero!

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.400
I think they're both pretty cool.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.400
Látom.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.450
