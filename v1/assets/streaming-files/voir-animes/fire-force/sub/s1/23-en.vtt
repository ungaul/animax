00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.530
As the world was being covered in ash, one man appeared.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.780
He would be later be called Raffles I.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.580
Raffles took his disciples and left on a journey in search of light.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.710
At the end of his journey, he found an "unsullied flame,"

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.670
and brought forth the light that would be mankind's salvation.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.730
Here I come, Sho!

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520
Stop playing at being my brother!

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.400
This is unpleasant. Why do you persist?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.950
You have no memories of me, either, do you?

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.740
Yes, your face! When you were a baby, Sho, you'd laugh, and cry,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.120
and act a lot more human!

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.500
Was that too dark? It's all right now. Your big brother helped you out.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.260
That was your memory. What an unpleasant vision.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.890
Stop coming in uninvited!

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.260
We used to be brothers!

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.760
Stop!

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.520
No way!

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.350
Not until I get the real you back!

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.360
Accelerate...

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.530
...back to the time when we were brothers...

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.150
...and take hold of it!

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.660
You're the devil. Devil!

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.910
You disgust me.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.920
Just look at his face. When his family died,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.210
word is that's the way he smiled.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.430
These are Shinra Kusakabe's memories?

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.850
Just hold on.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.770
Shinra Kusakabe's memories are flowing into my head.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.690
Frankly,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.280
I don't know what kind of feelings I'll have when I see you, Sho.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.830
Even so, the promise I made Mom

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.370
is the bond that keeps our family together!

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.920
Promises... Bonds... What do those things even mean?

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.880
You're right. The promise I made to Mom is important to me,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.470
but now that I'm seeing you like this...

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.930
...the promise doesn't have anything to do with it.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.690
Whatever the case, it doesn't matter to me.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.350
Are you sure?

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.860
Look, Kusakabe is here.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.240
Mother-killer.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.530
I heard he killed his baby brother, too.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.040
Huh? How?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.620
He burned him up. What is he, a devil?

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.290
It wasn't me. Someone was there... during the fire...

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.960
Someone besides Mom and Sho.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.930
I'm going to find him... and I swear, no matter what, I'll tear him a new one!

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.720
Did you see his face just now?

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.930
He's the devil.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.900
Leave me alone. Ever since the fire, I get that nervous smile.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.440
I killed Sho?

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.400
I'm not the devil!

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.150
I'd sure like to see you again...

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.410
Mom... Sho...

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.500
What is the point of showing me these memories?

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.460
I am not your brother!

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.550
You and I are the same.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.340
How is it that when we were little, we were able to smile,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.390
but now, neither of can openly do so anymore?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.390
I don't have a past. I don't need a past.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.910
Is this memory... one which I've lost?

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.710
Twelve years ago, we were a family.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.790
Mom, and you, and me.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.760
Up until that fire broke out,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.470
you and I both could smile without having to think about it.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.930
We just merrily smiled, every day, with Mom...

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.430
...and we were happy.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.480
We were brothers, and we were a family.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.150
Sho... Shinra...

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.280
I love you.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.240
This woman... is our mother...?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.910
Mom, what are you making?

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.330
Hamburger.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.660
Hooray!

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.120
I'm washing my hands now, just hold on, okay?

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.960
Let me handle it, Mom. I'll go help him.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.050
I'm coming, Sho!

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.550
Are you okay? Your big brother is here, so don't you worry.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.520
The wind must have blown that on you.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.730
Sorry, sorry. I'll get that for you right now.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.730
Dark... Scary... Help...

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.110
The light...

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.410
Was that too dark? It's all right now. Your big brother helped you out.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.170
Stop crying, now. Your big brother is a hero.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.550
See? Don't worry. Your big brother will always be in your corner.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.530
You were in the dark a long time, huh?

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.860
I'm sorry for leaving you by yourself for so long.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.620
Let's get out of this place, and go someplace more bright.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.250
I'll take you there.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.420
This man is... my brother...

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.800
Let's go home.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.760
"Episode 23: Smiles"

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.100
Ah! Shinra-kun!

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.440
Sho, this isn't your fault...

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.620
Haumea!

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.490
Hi-dee 'lo.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.380
Oh, my. It looks like he couldn't control his speed,

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.010
and ended up stabbing himself.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.390
Shinra Kusakabe bears an Adolla Burst.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.850
We can't have him dying on us. I will withdraw with him.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.520
This is bad! Another enemy has shown up!

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.980
Who the hell are you? You're the ones who abducted Sho, aren't you?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.780
What do you plan to do after you collect your Adolla Bursts?

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.950
The Great Cataclysm, 250 years ago, seems to have been a misfire.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:28.630
By gathering Adolla Bursts, we're going to kick-start the Great Cataclysm again!

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.670
That's why we're using bugs to create pyrokinetics,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.090
and searching for Adolla Bursts!

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.970
Also, we need you and Sho to do that!

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.180
Hey! Why are you telling him?!

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.470
Whoops...

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.480
Who cares? Even if they know, there's no way they can stop us.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.480
Now then, let's claim Shinra Kusakabe.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.030
Oh? Sho, is something wrong?

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.650
First, tell me what happened 12 years ago.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.570
Who can say? I'm a sucker for forceful men,

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.580
so why don't you beat it out of me?

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.700
Stop screwing around.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.790
Come on, out of the way.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.540
Severed Universe.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.880
Oh? Is something the matter?

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.670
Time isn't stopping. My Link has been cut.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.010
Sho!

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.350
Sho!

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.110
What have you done?!

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:42.030
What do you know? You're still pretty lively, aren't you? Amazing, amazing!

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.120
Okay, why don't we get going, too?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.540
Sh-Shinra-kun!

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.540
What the hey?

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.720
I was trying for her head, but got deflected.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.930
Arthur... Lieutenant...

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.890
I'm going to be the one to put you down, Devil!

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.940
No dying on me in here!

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.530
Some uninvited intruders have turned up. Man...

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.160
Arthur, she uses some kind of strange technique.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.870
You keep quiet. Don't talk. Hush up.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.540
Now, you're in my way. Move. Move it.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.540
Hmm?

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.130
Huh? It didn't work.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.510
What a load. A scare technique? Come at me.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.260
Plasma... Must be interfering with my electric signal.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.140
Ah! You're a pain-in-the-ass opponent!

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.390
Haumea! We're out of time! We have to go!

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:56.980
Yeah! I know! It'll only take a moment to crush these guys!

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.030
Now what is it?

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.490
My Tekkyo... Did the electrical system short out?

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.910
Help Shinra while I keep her at bay!

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.660
--Yes, sir! --Yes, sir!

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.250
Lieutenant!

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.790
Bah! Plasma!

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.170
That plasma is getting my wires crossed, and I can't reach their nerves!

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.550
Damn that plasma-user!

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.010
He's a real pain in the ass.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.180
Shinra, you're going to be okay now.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.150
Oh! The earthquake is starting.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.610
This tremor... It's shaking in the creepiest way...

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.320
It is the doing of the Evangelist!

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.490
We're out of time, Haumea!

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.160
See you later, if you survive.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.830
Sho...

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.670
--Wait! Give Sho back!

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.750
--No! Don't move! --Wait! Give Sho back!

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.260
We're getting out of here, too!

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.750
It's still shaking.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.920
This is going on much too long.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.720
She said it was the Evangelist's doing. What are they up to?

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:52.100
Sh-Sho is... Shinra, right now, you just hold on tight!

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.850
If you survive, you can see your brother again!

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.100
To the emergency room?

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.440
Good idea. Let's call on our colleague.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.860
When it comes to treating pyrokinetics, no one can beat her.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.330
"Special Fire Hospital 6"

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.500
Director Huang!

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.420
Director Kayoko Huang!

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.710
"Lieutenant" "Second-generation pyrokinetic" "Asako Hague"

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.590
Emergency!

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.510
What is it, Lieutenant Hague?

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.470
"Captain" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Kayoko Huang"

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.860
Captain Huang, my gratitude. I have a gravely injured crewman.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.440
We were informed by the empire.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.410
Was he injured during that underground operation?

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.450
Yes.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.330
How did the Nether investigation go?

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.290
Any guesses what's causing that incessant quaking?

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.870
Are you sure the great Sol isn't mad at the 8th

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.540
for violating the forbidden Nether?

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.720
That isn't it. It turns out this "Evangelist" and the White-Clad

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.800
have been creating man-made Infernals.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.970
They're looking for those who possess Adolla Bursts,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.430
flames that come from the underworld Adolla,

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.890
in order to destroy the world.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.110
I'll ask you all about it later.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.820
Captain Huang...

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.650
...can you fix up Shinra?

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:35.030
Honestly, it will be tough. Maybe if the patient has enough strength left...

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.250
And even if we do save his life, the worst-case scenario

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.290
is that he'll suffer lasting effects, such as being paralyzed.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.500
Patient is a third generation, and possesses an Adolla Burst, you say?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.760
Yes.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.220
I have never come into contact with the sacred flame known as an Adolla Burst.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.310
There is no telling what may happen.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:02.310
He's my valued crewman. Captain Huang...

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.770
...please do your best.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.490
I'll try. I'll do everything I can.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:16.240
"Operating"

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:21.540
O Sol, please grant Shinra-san the light of life.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:30.130
Extraction of the sword successful. His vitals have stabilized, too.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:34.800
Now I have to treat him with my ability. Then again, with a wound like this...

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.640
I'm not sure my ability alone can heal it.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.310
It rests with the strength of his flame, as well.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.110
Here goes.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:52.070
Now beginning the final operation on patient Shinra Kusakabe.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.070
Rod of Asclepius!

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.830
Serpent, revitalize him!

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.300
It's been an hour since the operation started.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.720
Where are the others?

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.220
The sister went to pray for Kusakabe.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.770
Lieutenant Hinawa is also being treated,

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.230
and Investigator Licht is investigating.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.940
What about Vulcan?

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.020
He's with Lisa-san.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.610
Apparently, Lisa-san is an emotional wreck.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.450
So is the 6th a hospital? What kind of company is this?

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.370
You really don't know anything, huh?

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.910
You're aware that all medical treatment in the empire

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.500
are rites that can only be performed by the Holy Sol Temple, right?

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.050
You see, like the 1st, the 6th is an entity of the Holy Sol Temple,

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.880
and is the company that specializes in medical treatment.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:02.060
Uh-huh. So that means this is a Holy Sol Temple. One that's a hospital.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.480
It's a Special Fire Force Company!

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.980
I hear that no one is better than the 6th's Captain Huang

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.690
when it comes to treating pyrokinetics.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:15.190
Word is that she uses a unique ability to heal them.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.370
Is there something special about Captain Huang's treatment?

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.530
Apparently, her ability controls a flaming serpent

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.960
that treats injuries, illnesses, and all sorts of symptoms.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.630
When the patient is a pyrokinetic, it also makes use of their flame

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.630
to instantly relieve them of their suffering.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.800
It's a pretty flame.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.600
At this rate, there should be no problem at all.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.890
This Adolla Burst is incredible.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.440
He's used up all of his flame regenerating,

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.190
so it may be a few days before he wakes up.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.650
"Operating"

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.280
It's been three days.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.320
It's clear out.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.990
I'm awake.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.830
I'm sure hungry. I want some rice.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:16.260
What happened to Sho? I managed to save him, but...

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.470
Has he gone back to the Evangelist again?

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.480
I should be looking at this sky with my brother...

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.860
Damn it!

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.400
Impressive. You're awake, just like Captain Huang predicted.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:46.290
Must be the light from the sun, but you don't even look that pale.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:52.120
That being said, you're still on the mend. At ease.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.210
I'm just glad you're all right.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.460
Captain Burns? What are you doing here, sir?

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.340
I came to check up on you.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:07.390
Check up? You came here for a second class Fire Soldier from the 8th?

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.430
Am I putting you out?

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:10.930
No, sir.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.400
If you're up to it, how about a little check-up visit chat?

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.650
About that fire that happened 12 years ago.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.870
Get dressed. How about we take in some of the air outside

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.910
while you have some rice?

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.680
Are you a big eater?

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.760
Yes, sir, more than usual.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.810
You sure have grown up.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.890
You've known who I was for the last 12 years, haven't you?

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:00.150
You really were the Fire Soldier who was there at the time.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.280
You knew everything, sir?

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:07.070
Yeah. If I had been the one who reported the truth of that fire,

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.620
you wouldn't have had to bear the stigma of killing your mom and brother.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.710
I don't care what happened to me!

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.920
Captain Burns, did you know that Sho was still alive, too?

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.790
Yeah... I knew.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:23.550
Then, did you know he had been taken away to the Evangelist, too, sir?

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.680
Yeah... I knew.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.010
Why didn't you help him?!

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.180
Why didn't you say anything to me?

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:36.100
If I'd known, I wouldn't have left Sho in that darkness for 12 years!

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:43.860
After 12 years, you're all grown up, and you still nearly died, so if I had told you,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.450
what do you think you could have done?

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:51.830
This was a fluke. I'm not the same as I was when we first sparred.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.750
I'm not so sure. The fluke is that you survived.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.170
If you're really not the same, then show me.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.000
Come at me.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.970
"To be continued"

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.060
Look at the imaginations in my head and I'll go back to myself

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:22.070
Forcing right decisions on me is like a devil that eats me up

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.870
He that used his claws on me

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.670
Uses the same claws to defend someone else

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.670
Weapons turn into both wounds and shields

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.130
Isn't that what life's about?

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.920
A secret known to none

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.470
For so long almost seems to disappear but never does

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.260
Been holding on to it

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.970
While spending a night in the fire

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.560
The more they're attracted, the more the ignorant laugh

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.350
What used to make up the universe until yesterday takes the helm

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.610
The entire range of emotions that breathes

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:05.730
Don't want to take away what I haven't even experienced

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:11.030
Look at the imaginations in my head and I'll go back to myself

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:17.450
Forcing right decisions on me is like a devil that eats me up

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.790
Don't get in my way anymore

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:29.840
I won't be killed by your ideals

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.430
