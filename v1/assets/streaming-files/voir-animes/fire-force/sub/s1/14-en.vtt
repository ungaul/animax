00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.150
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.820
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.800
I'm begging you, go where you're directed!

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.140
Shut up! I don't want your opinion!

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.140
When faced with an unexpected disaster,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.810
those taking the correct course of action are roughly 10%.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.020
Those who are frantic and take inadequate action make up 20%.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.650
The remaining 70% are struck motionless out of shock.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.830
Which is why they need a leader to direct them.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.620
You are the only one who can disrupt this situation...

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.620
...demolishing king of Asakusa.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.590
Konro!

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.920
I've been looking for you.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.220
Yeah, me, too. The Infernals and the fighting in town are only getting worse.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.640
There are misunderstandings all over, and nobody knows what's happening.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.150
Apparently, there's an enemy that can alter people's faces.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.650
Then tell that to the folks in town!

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.320
They won't listen to anyone else but you!

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.950
Give a speech that will calm Asakusa down!

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.700
That is not my duty to perform, sir.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.330
Everyone down there is waiting for the big man to bring order out of chaos.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.920
Yeah, which is why I came here. It's because everybody is so upset

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.670
that we need to hear from someone with your kind of level-headed judgment.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.300
Waka, are you still talking like that?

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.310
You can't keep deferring to me.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.440
It's time for you to make your resolve, already.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.070
No matter what anyone else says, Asakusa is your town, Waka.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.830
They don't want to hear just anyone's words;

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.250
they want to hear the words of Beni.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.340
Konro, get down off the tower.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.260
Yes, sir.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.850
Someone like me can't do anything else but tear things down.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.940
That's the best you can expect.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.740
I'm going to smash things up.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.950
"Episode 14: For Whom the Flames Burn"

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.830
The darkness is illuminated

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.460
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.170
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.590
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.260
The end is illuminated

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.840
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.600
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.970
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.810
Flames rise to show us the way

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.490
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.950
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.210
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.920
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.760
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.800
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.350
Playthings that make sounds

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.060
and magic that chases pain away

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.150
are all precious treasures to me

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.780
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.700
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.540
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.510
--Hey, out of the way, dumbass! --You wanna get your ass kicked?!

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.840
That's enough, both of you!

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.680
Let me more hear of this shouting.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.600
Ah, how rowdy.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.310
Marvelous! This chaos is art!

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.530
Marvelous art of my making!

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.030
What was that?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.040
Beni!
It's Beni-chan!

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.040
Benimaru!

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.040
Beni?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.340
Th-The tower... That's crazy.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.560
Do you hear me, Asakusa?!

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.700
Right now, our town is under attack from the outside!

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.450
They make themselves look just like Asakusa folk, and trick us!

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.670
There's no way to tell who they are!

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.130
We are going to get nowhere like this!

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.340
But... I don't give a damn!

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.090
Yeah! Beni! Right! Right!

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.010
You must have something in mind to be saying that!

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.690
He changed the whole atmosphere in the blink of an eye.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.270
This is what they mean when they say "the word from on high."

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.530
Waka!

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.240
Captain Shinmon, what are your orders?!

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:43.340
All of you start clobbering each other! Doesn't matter if you're fake or real!

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.260
The people of Asakusa will not be outdone by a bunch of impostors!

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.140
Don't worry. The 7th will see to the fires and the Infernals.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.720
Beat each other up for all you're worth!

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.030
Festival's on! Festival!

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.240
Fight-fest!

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.370
Haran... You ate a flame bug?

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.750
This is Asakusa. A power spot. A demon might even appear.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.960
So why don't I test that out on myself?

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.850
He turned himself into an Infernal.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.570
Not just any Infernal. An Infernal with horns.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.740
A demon.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.240
--Ow! --Now you've done it!

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.500
That hurt, you bastard!

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.210
How barbaric. This is not art!

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.420
There are definitely impostors being beaten up with the real townspeople.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.760
Should we start punching each other, too?

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.680
Give me a break, sir.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.690
7th, your sparring partners will be the fires! Get to work putting them out!

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.820
--Yes, sir! --Yes, sir!

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.030
Lieutenant Konro, you sure seem happy.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.700
Well of course I'm happy.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.450
Honestly, he kept us waiting long enough.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.510
It looks like I've found my opponent.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.610
That... looks like him.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.350
Huh?

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:48.270
That was an Adolla Link, huh? You really don't belong in the Fire Force.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.020
What was that?

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.650
Devil, yours are the flames that exterminate mankind.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.200
Hey, you dumbass devil! Help me out!

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.530
Arthur!

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.910
Huh? The bow chick... is gone?

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.760
You're hard!

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.360
You're facing me now.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:45.120
Hey, captain of the 7th, this isn't any ordinary Infernal.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:51.380
Two years ago, a horned Infernal appeared here in Asakusa.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.960
It's the reason why Konro has his tephrosis.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.430
You guys stay out of this. I'm taking over this fight.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.070
Hikage-chan!

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.820
Hikage!

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.650
Hika!

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.870
There's someone over there.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.200
Over there?

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.960
You said you'd give me treats in exchange for my kimono,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.710
but they weren't nearly enough!

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:41.800
Damn you! I didn't even tell Hina! Now Hina won't be happy, either!

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.930
Hika!

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.850
That jerk who pretended to be you was so gross! Let's beat them silly.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.730
Huh? So these guys are villains after all?

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.400
--Hee-hee-hee! --Hee-hee-hee!

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.110
--Yi-i-ikes! --Yi-i-ikes!

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.200
--That's hot! That's so hot! Hey! --That's hot! That's so hot! Hey!

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.060
He's easily turning aside that demon's ferocious attacks.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.200
Ow. You're a hard one, all right.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.040
Two years ago, Konro opened up a gigantic hole in the ground.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.370
That means I'm gonna need about the same amount of firepower.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.340
This is for what happened to Konro.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.880
I can't afford to blow the whole town apart in the process, though!

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.940
I'm just gonna take us someplace a little more open.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.190
Two Infernals at nine o'clock, at the intersection 200 meters away.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.320
Yes, sir!

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.190
What's that?!

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.360
It's the captain!

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.080
The sky, huh? Beni is the only one who could pull this stunt off.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.210
They're targeting Beni?!

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.090
I don't care how strong he is, one direct hit and he's finished.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.550
Oh, no you don't!

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.350
Beni...

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:03.440
My body... won't move... Somebody... save Beni...

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.570
Before you decide to give your life away, please use me!

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.950
Save Beni...

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.370
Shinra!

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.590
What was that? My legs again...

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.130
Thanks. I appreciate how you feel.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.220
Lieutenant Konro?

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.220
That's... I've got you.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.520
What's the matter?!

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.350
No you don't!

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.190
The Devil's Footprints?

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.240
Let me be in time!

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.050
Shinra!

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.300
What speed he has.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.350
He caught up to my arrow.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.560
Still...

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.190
You can't deflect my arrow with the will of your flames.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:33.070
You really don't belong in the Fire Force.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.960
Devil, yours are the flames that exterminate mankind.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.040
Screw that.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.590
Mine are the flames that preserve mankind!

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.850
Shinra... Come on!

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.470
Look up in the sky!

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.100
What is that?

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.610
You, who possess an Adolla Burst, like the commander,

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.730
choose to be a tool of the ignoble?

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.110
Become a devil with us.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.280
Help us burn this world down.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.740
I'm going to be a hero that saves everyone with my flames!

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.200
I'm going to prove that right now!

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.170
I'm Kick-This-Away-Whatever-It-Takes Man!

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.040
What?

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.960
He did it!

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.050
Captain Shinmon!

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.760
I'll take it from here.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.810
This altitude should be high enough.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.160
Iai Chop, Form Seven:

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.580
Sun Wheel!

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.130
Tch, not even that can crack you, huh?

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.010
Captain! Let him have it!

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.760
Keep Asakusa safe!

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.470
Go, Beni!

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:21.140
I don't care about the Evangelist or the White-Clad, but Asakusa is my town!

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.270
I won't have anyone acting big in my home.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.650
That's right, Beni. This is your town.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.280
I'm going to have to borrow your move, Konro.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.160
Those flames were...

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:45.960
...the Crimson Moon...

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.670
That was an explosion caused by a single person?

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.630
What firepower!

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.260
That's why they call him the mightiest Fire Soldier.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:05.020
Those flames were a tiny bit arty.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.100
I hate them. I feel jealous.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.940
Yona, we're withdrawing. We have to report this to the commander.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:19.110
We confirmed that a second demon was born in the same spot. This is a bonanza.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:25.870
Haran, your life wasn't for naught.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.130
Awesome...

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.400
I really overdid it. I'm burned out.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.320
Lieutenant Konro, we've put out all the fires in town.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.200
There are no more Infernals, either.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:05.370
Good work. We'll have to thank the folks from the 8th, too.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.210
Particularly Shinra.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.960
"To be continued"

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.800
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.850
and curse the unwavering present,

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.970
but words that simply hang in the air

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.730
are not enough to save you

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.030
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.200
between sights we never reach

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.420
and pain that brings no warmth

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.540
to make it to a faraway place

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.800
Given the hope that you speak of

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.010
or the ideals that you dream of

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:07.770
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.020
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.980
and curse the unwavering present,

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.190
but words that simply hang in the air

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:23.780
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.830
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.040
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.170
I hope we can still walk together again

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.420
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.130
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.900
They sure did repair a lot of it overnight, huh?

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.070
If all the king of demolition ever did was demolish,

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.950
the townspeople wouldn't appreciate him nearly as much.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.950
Captain!

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.080
About that Evangelist-involved company from our records.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.120
What did you find?

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.000
Their office was burned down.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
It appears they took advantage of all the chaos to destroy the evidence.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.340
So they figured out the Special Fire Force's purpose here, and took action.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.930
This is a pretty sharp bunch.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.890
Our fighting this time around took its toll on the city, as well.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.850
I just hope this doesn't make them ramp up their activities.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.570
You're going back to the 8th? I appreciate all the help.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.860
--Yeah, thanks! --Yeah, thanks!

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:51.990
Oh, no. Our coming here might have been the trigger that set everything off.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.540
Even if it was,

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.170
it doesn't change the fact that the Evangelist's goons were lurking here.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:02.500
All the human combustion here up to now might even have been their doing.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.760
But we were able to put a stop to it.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.300
Konro, bring it here.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.350
Yes, sir.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.430
"It"?

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:17.060
I may not like the imperial Fire Force, but I do like the 8th.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.900
Hey, musclebound dummy!

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.440
And his crew!

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.530
The next time you come here, you better bring candy, or we'll be mad!

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.320
And make sure you bring stuff that doesn't suck!

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.070
--Bye-bye-kins! --Bye-bye-kins!

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.990
Japanese saké?

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.500
We exchange saké cups as a token of mutual goodwill.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.670
It's a rite of friendship from the old country.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.090
You don't like saké?

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.510
I love it!

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:01.400
This means the 7th and the 8th are now friends, right?

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.610
Good to know you.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.990
Huh? That's a hell of a smile.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.030
What is the matter with his face?

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.200
Could he really be that happy to make friends with all of us?

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.250
When Beni drinks saké, he becomes the king of glee, and can't stop smiling.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.130
How do you figure I'm gleeful?

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.540
Obi Akitaru, was it?

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.920
If anything comes up, give me a call anytime.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:31.760
Right. Now that we're drinking buddies, let's help each other out.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.220
That smile is a bit off-putting.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.770
You know, I have to say...

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.450
What's so funny, you little brat?

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.410
"Next time"

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:58.460
"Episode 15: The Blacksmith's Dream"
