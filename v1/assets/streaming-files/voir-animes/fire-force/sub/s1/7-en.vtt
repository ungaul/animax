00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:08.110
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.240
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.020
"Special Fire Grand Cathedral 1"

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.440
"Lieutenant Priest" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Huo Yan Li"

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.940
"Lieutenant Priest" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Rekka Hoshimiya"

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.450
"Lieutenant Priest" "Second-generation pyrokinetic" "Karim Flam"

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.910
"Captain" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Leonard Burns"

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.250
The 8th and the 5th have carried out a joint training exercise.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.250
It seems overly contrived.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.330
So Obi is finally making his move.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.850
The darkness is illuminated

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.480
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.190
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.610
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.320
The end is illuminated

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.860
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.610
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.990
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.870
Flames rise to show us the way

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.540
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.970
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.220
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.940
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.770
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.820
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.370
Playthings that make sounds

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.080
and magic that chases pain away

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.160
are all precious treasures to me

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.790
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.720
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.560
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.470
Cook!

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.810
With the greatest of skill, and the perfect amount of heat!

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.730
Cook.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.440
With the greatest of skill, and the perfect amount of heat.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.160
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming and taking part

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.170
in the job-well-done party for the nighttime joint 5th and 8th exercise

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.170
that was carried out the other night.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.170
--The result of the exercise was Captain Hibana throwing a fit\
--Ah, are we about to get chewed out again?

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.420
--as to how soft the 5th really is.
--Don't sound so happy about it.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.470
Scumwad.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.140
Gravel does not speak--does not even breathe without permission!

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.180
You gravel grit!

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.520
Right, Shinra?

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.230
Crunch...

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.940
We appreciate you taking on a weaker company such as ourselves...

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.900
Go ahead.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.520
O-Okay.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.240
There we are.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.120
"5th Angels Three" "Not 5th Angels Three"

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.540
Die, will-o-wisps!

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.590
Hey, what are you doing?!

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.840
The lieutenant told me that if you play with fire, I was to kill them.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.300
This is an informal party!

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.180
Látom.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.930
All right, so you're saying we have the 5th's full cooperation?

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.200
Not the 5th; me, personally.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.660
The 5th may be a subsidiary outfit, but it is paired with Haijima.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.460
At present, it would be hard for the 8th to confront Haijima head-on.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.210
You were going to lead off by exposing our research data

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.370
and bringing down the 5th, right?

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.900
Yeah, well...

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.760
How did you come by your intel on the 5th?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.350
Were Iris's actions something you factored in?

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.850
No, of course not. However, she was my ace card against you.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.140
Playing innocent, huh? I don't appreciate that.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.570
I doubt a musclebound gorilla like yourself

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.890
could understand the 5th's research.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.330
Just be grateful that I'm working with you.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.710
Why the change of heart?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.250
I went through an incident that made me despair of flames.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.420
The more I learned about this land--about this world,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.220
the more I couldn't help but grow more perverse.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.970
And by growing more perverse,

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.390
I wanted to believe that I was becoming stronger, and smarter.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.430
That if I was to oppose this crapfest of a world,

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.680
I had no choice but to fight evil with evil.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.040
But then,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.690
when I got clobbered by Shinra, the self-professed hero, I remembered.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.380
The warmth of flames. The tenderness of justice.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.160
I was put in touch once again with the ideal of fighting the evil in the world.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.960
Then, Princess, Shinra was a hero to you?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.750
N-No, nothing of the sort at all!

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.760
He's our vaunted hero of the 8th.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.970
I'm sure he'll bring to light the darkness of a world held captive by flames.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.350
Investigating each company and pursuing the mystery of the flames

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.950
is the objective of the 8th, then?

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.070
Yeah. That's the reason why we came by to steal the 5th's data.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.740
We heard that you'd come across something in your research

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.550
that would explain the cause of human combustion.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.150
Is that true?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.490
Yeah. You can understand why I would become a devil, too, right?

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.540
There's someone who is deliberately creating Infernals.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.630
Of course, not all spontaneous human combustion in the world is such.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.680
But there were some samples among my research

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.050
that were clearly different from the others.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.640
So there really is someone out there causing human combustion.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.850
There's no way that stands. I swear we'll find them!

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.610
My friends... the sisters, burned up.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.820
If that was done at somebody's hand...

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.910
...then I swear, in the name of St. John's wort and the malice it symbolizes,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.040
that I will find them and burn them by any means necessary.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.080
Our objective is the same, then.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.960
Hmm, much as I hate to admit it.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.920
But your investigation is only going to get harder from here.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.630
How do you mean?

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.350
The Infernals that I suspect have appeared by human means

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.350
are all concentrated around the Shinjuku District.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.850
That's... the 1st's jurisdiction.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.360
"Episode 7: The Investigation of the 1st Commences"

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.080
Nee-san, why are you at the 8th?

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.710
To make sure you grew up right, Iris.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.630
Hey, that was a dirty move!

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.210
How rude. My body is nice and clean.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.210
That isn't what I meant!

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.080
Must be nice for you two, having girlish, willowy figures.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.850
And you have a nicely-trained, beautiful body, don't you?

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.060
Heh, heh, I-I do?

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.170
Nee-san,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.800
you're about to do something dangerous again, aren't you?

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.860
Yeah. I'm working together with you to investigate the 1st.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.340
It could mean war.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.620
An undercover investigation of the 1st

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.060
using the rookie training reassignment system?

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.960
That's pretty good thinking, for a gorilla, Obi.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.840
The rookie training reassignment system

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.380
is one that allows crew members in their first year of service

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.180
to be temporarily assigned to other companies to broaden their experience.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.390
I'm going to have you two do an undercover investigation of the 1st.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.440
An undercover investigation of the 1st? Arthur and me?

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.550
Within the 1st's jurisdiction,

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:14.530
there may be someone who is artificially creating Infernals.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.450
We want you to come up with any leads you can.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.270
It's an important mission to help us crack human combustion.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.750
I'm counting on both of you.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.580
If there really is someone causing human combustion, they'll pay for it.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It may seem unnatural if there are only men from the 8th.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.800
I'll send someone from my company, too.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.760
I'll hit up other companies I have connections with, too.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.890
"Special Fire Grand Cathedral 1-- The Holy Sol Obelisk"

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.400
So this is the Holy Sol Obelisk. It's even bigger than I imagined.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.780
We could still climb it.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.660
This is lame.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.490
I'm not sure I'm worthy to enter the sacred 1st.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.290
Who are they?

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.460
They're camouflage. Make nice with them, okay?

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.710
Thank you for taking us on.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.140
So you're the trainee newbies?

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.440
Sheesh, I bet even your crap is crap. Are you crappy, you crap?

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.450
"I bet even your crap is crap."

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.310
"Are you crappy, you crap?"

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.160
It sounds like he's trying to berate us,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.920
but he's just calling crap "crap."

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:56.300
You've got the ass of an ass. An ass should ass like an ass,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.260
you ass!

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.470
What was that?!

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.260
Easy! He's just saying your ass is an ass.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.950
Captain Burns is expecting you. Follow me.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.340
Burns of the 1st--the man who knows about the fire 12 years ago.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.470
That fire...

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.870
This is the Grand Cathedral.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.330
If it was actually caused by someone...

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.550
Welcome to the 1st. I'm happy to have you.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.080
...I'm one step closer.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.360
Good grief, military fatigues in the Grand Cathedral?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.440
They're guests. Go easy on them.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.160
First Class Fire Soldier Maki Oze, from the 8th!

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.720
I have brought the new recruits for training!

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.410
While this is a formal function, we're still in the Grand Cathedral.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:15.080
Forgive me for asking, but I'd prefer that you tent hands, rather than salute.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.590
Please excuse us!

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:27.190
Lieutenant Flam, Lieutenant Hoshimiya, and Lieutenant Li, of the 1st.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.870
They are going to be taking care of you.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.940
After you've looked around the facility today,

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.610
relax and make yourselves at home.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.820
Captain Burns, if I may?

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.030
I realize this is sudden, but in order to have you assess our abilities,

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.240
I would like to ask you to take us on in some sparring.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.580
Shinra! What are you talking about?!

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.670
We are aware of your abilities from the paperwork we received on you.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.040
That will not be necessary.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.380
That's all right. Rekka, let them practice on you, too.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.190
Huh? Do you mean it?!

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.260
Rekka, we're in the Grand Cathedral.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.970
Shinra, what do you think you're doing?

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.720
Just a light jab.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.480
If I can beat you, there's something I'd like to ask you.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:18.880
Fine with me.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.700
Hmm, I can't help but worry.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.200
You've already sent them out. Now please, calm down.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.380
Be that as it may, worrying is a captain's prerogative.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.590
"Organic"
You're disrupting me.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.800
Hey! Take it easy! Get back to your duties!

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.180
Why don't you head back to the 5th, ma'am?

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.350
Man, that Shinra-- Just because he beat me,

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.090
I hope he isn't too full of himself.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.020
You twerp!

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.650
No sooner do you get here than you're sparring with the captain?!

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.570
He's never even sparred with me before!

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.360
If he hurts Lieutenant Rekka, I'll let him have it!

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.710
I'm gonna do this, damn it! I'll make him spill everything he knows!

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.400
Why do you suppose he has such a chip on his shoulder?

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.390
He's so delighted to be at the 1st, he's all revved up.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.840
He's a high-spirited crewman, all right! I'm starting to get fired up!

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.400
Who gets to go first?

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.860
I'll start with the lowest-numbered company.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.330
There's no need to hold back. Put your full power on display for me.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.550
Does that mean...?

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.200
Huh?! I have to go first?!

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.710
"Second Class Fire Soldier" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Takeru Noto"

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.220
I'm Lieutenant Hoshimiya. I'll be your opponent.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.390
Second Class Fire Soldier Takeru Noto.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.520
My family owns a jagaimo farm, so I got the nickname "Jaga Noto." [jagaimo: potato]

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.460
Oh, as in "Juggernaut"!

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.020
Let's have ourselves a heated match!

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.930
F-Fire!

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.830
Is he all right?

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:34.490
There's fire coming from me, too! I'd like to get this fire put out!

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.620
Nice! Not bad! That's your fervent passion, is it?

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.920
It is so bad! It's utterly bad!

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.000
It's hot!

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.470
That's incredible, Juggernaut! Let me see the best flames you've got!

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.430
It's getting a little too warm for comfort, huh?

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.300
Are you sure this is a good idea, sir?

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.970
I'll deal with any stray shots.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.390
See that you do, Karim.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.350
Sheesh, nuisances are really nuisances. What a nuisance.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:07.150
I'm simmering here! We Fire Soldiers have been waiting for talent like yours!

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:12.030
Stop! Don't get me stirred up! I'm afraid of flames!

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.320
I became a Fire Soldier so I could get my flames put out!

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.870
This is what happens when you get me stirred up!

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.100
This amount of heat is incredible! Every single shot is a juggernaut!

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.210
Lieutenant Rekka!

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.180
That's it! Fantastic! Just like that!

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.490
Go easier on the easygoing, you easy-goer!

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.390
I have you backing me up, don't I, Karim?

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.560
--What the...? --He snuffed them out!

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.860
Where did that tremendous energy come from?

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.410
The flames got chilled out?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.580
Rekka!

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.420
That would have hit the captain if I hadn't been here!

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.100
And I trusted you to be here for me, Karim!

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:21.270
The 1st has a Fire Soldier who produces not flames, but ice?

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.890
Hm?

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:26.850
What kind of nonsense is that? Show me a person can create ice!

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.060
Then, that ice came from...?

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.280
Thermo-Acoustic Cooling.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.490
It's a technique that converts the energy of flames into sound,

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.780
and converts sound into cold.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.500
When you compress heat, you can convert it to sound.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.780
As sound abrades the air, in can be converted into cold.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.460
You're saying you can turn flame energy into sound and cold?

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.920
Such a thing is really possible?

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.220
There's someone within the 1st's jurisdiction

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.060
who is artificially creating Infernals.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.740
Is the culprit among this bunch?

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.860
Or, are they all in cahoots?

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.090
All right, next!

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.780
I never fight without a purpose, so you'll have to excuse me.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.370
I-I only have the abilities that you see in the paperwork,

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:29.060
nothing more, nothing less, so I'll decline, too.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.460
That would make our next contestant...

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.220
I will take you both on.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.640
Why is the captain letting them fight him?

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.680
Bring it on.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.700
You won't be getting a turn. I will gallantly beat my opponent.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.960
The end.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.590
What are you planning to do with that hand?

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:26.720
Come at me as hard as you can. Otherwise, this match will mean nothing.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.310
Don't blame me if you lose an arm.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.520
It will take more than that much flame to cut me. Set your mind at ease.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:42.240
"That much flame"? Arthur's Excalibur can cut through even steel.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.220
Don't come crying to me later!

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.210
So you have a sword that never fails to kill. Don't you have any other moves?

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:08.340
No way. Not even Maki could extinguish Excalibur.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.680
What are you waiting for?!

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.810
Don't ease up on him!

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.000
This crewman packs some amazing force, as well.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.300
This will kill you if you don't step aside!

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.270
What?!

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.060
Why did you become a Fire Soldier?

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.770
My mother and brother died in a fire!

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.730
I'm going to solve the mystery of human combustion,

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.320
and make sure that kind of fire never happens again!

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.070
It was to become a hero who could save the world from the flame terror!

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.320
You have a long way to go.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.590
The 1st welcomes you. I hope you find this training enrollment fulfilling.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.640
Captain! Are you hurt?!

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.090
There we go.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.900
I won't let your lucky lechery get triggered so easily, Tamaki.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.500
Lieutenant Rekka... I'm so sorry this always happens!

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.810
I'll take charge of you guys from the 8th.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:01.170
You were no match for Captain Burns, but you two still did fairly fair.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.840
Of course we did.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.170
Thank you very much, sir.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.280
But whether your pace keeps you apace of this pace,

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.890
or whether your pace does not keep you apace of this pace,

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.140
is all up to you. Hang in there.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.610
Thank you very much, sir!

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.980
"To be continued"

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.860
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.910
and curse the unwavering present,

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.030
but words that simply hang in the air

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.790
are not enough to save you

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.100
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.260
between sights we never reach

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.480
and pain that brings no warmth

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.610
to make it to a faraway place

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.860
Given the hope that you speak of

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.070
or the ideals that you dream of

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:13.830
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.080
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.040
and curse the unwavering present,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.250
but words that simply hang in the air

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:29.840
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.890
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.100
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.230
I hope we can still walk together again

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.440
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.150
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.450
