00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.280
You do, of course, know what's taking place in the world right now, right?

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.910
The world is in shambles. In some places, flames are being whipped up,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.080
space is distorting in a way that is carving up continents,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.220
and many countries that once existed have fallen.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.250
Right now, there are few places where you can live a decent life

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.190
other than here in the Tokyo Empire.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.510
And so, people gather here in the relatively undamaged Tokyo,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.600
where the Holy Sol Temple and Haijima Industries have developed

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.760
Amaterasu, the perpetual thermal energy plant.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.980
The empire is the beneficiary of its vast energy,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.500
and has also made further advancements.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.320
Does this story keep going on?

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.360
Who knows? If it were up to me, I'd like it to continue.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.910
So how did it go?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.660
This stuff I had you make for me did some interesting things.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.880
Special Fire Force Company 8, with that devil guy?

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.090
I did a little checking into them.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.930
Their captain, Akitaru Obi, was decorated twice in his firefighter days.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.320
He was also stripped of them twice.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.430
"Akitaru Obi"

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.060
The reason why they stripped them is because

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.090
he disobeyed orders to give priority to life-saving.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.650
Very nice. A model fireman, whether for good or bad.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.680
You could say the 8th

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.310
has been built up on the strength of Obi's character and magnetism.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.070
They're a different animal than the other companies.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.800
It's fascinating.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.960
"Shinra"

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.840
The darkness is illuminated

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.470
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.180
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.600
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.310
The end is illuminated

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.850
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.600
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.980
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.860
Flames rise to show us the way

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.530
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.960
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.210
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.930
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.760
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.810
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.360
Playthings that make sounds

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.070
and magic that chases pain away

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.160
are all precious treasures to me

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.780
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.710
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.550
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.470
"Episode 3: The Rookie Fire Soldier Games"

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.720
Yeah! The Rookie Games!

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.140
Tamaki Kotatsu is here to rock!

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.310
"Second Class Fire Soldier" "Third-generation pyrokinetic" "Tamaki Kotatsu"

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.940
Huh? What are you looking at?!

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.940
Nothing.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.650
Wow!

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.490
Wone Wone Nyine!

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.240
Wone Wone Nyine?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.780
You don't know them? They're the Fire Defense Agency's mascot characters,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.080
Wone Wone Nyine!

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.250
But one of them is just an older man.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.290
Ah, you mean Mamoru-kun?

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.040
Mamoru-kun...

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.250
The characters started out as two dogs and one cat,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.960
but the higher-ups at the Fire Defense Agency

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.390
complained about all three of them being animals,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.850
so one of them became a dog-faced older man.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.890
What's wrong with having them be two dogs and a cat?

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.600
Huh? But Mamoru-kun is cute!

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.160
Eh?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.760
Eh?!

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.970
That man was...

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.200
Excuse me!

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.630
Do you need something?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.730
Are you one of the rookies that came in this year?

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.200
Yes, sir! Shinra Kusakabe, Special Fire Force Company 8!

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.540
Um, if you don't mind me asking, do you remember that fire 12 years ago?

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.420
I don't have time to chat with you right now. Excuse me.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.420
I just need a moment!

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.420
Hey, you! Don't act so forward with my captain!

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.590
No, it's not like that! I'm sorry!

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.920
What are you smiling at, you pervert?!

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.940
Damn it! Why does my lucky lecher lure always have to activate?!

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.820
I know you stepped in to distract me, but that's really distracting.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.290
Captain of the 1st, can I have just a moment?

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.410
The competition is about to begin.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.880
All competitors, please put on your turnout gear and gather around.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.840
You said your name was Shinra?

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.630
Do you know how many fires break out in a year?

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.680
I'm sorry, but I don't remember something that happened 12 years ago.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.590
The competition is beginning. Go get ready.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.140
He's hiding something, isn't he?

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.390
What is this?

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.700
You are all about to charge into this building

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.600
which will be simulating a fire scene.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.750
After you overcome the obstacles and rescue those who require it,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.500
be the first to reach the crewman posing as an Infernal.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.990
So that's it. We're storming the castle.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.630
Is everyone ready?

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.180
Start!

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.350
Is he that confident?

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.480
Then again, in my case...

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.230
...I can just fly up there!

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.940
Wha--?!

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.400
Dirty pool. This is why I hate devils.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.360
Damn it!

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.870
Nekomata!

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.010
Heroes always arrive from the skies.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.860
Pardon the intrusion.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.760
I have to hurry and wrap up this contest,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.090
and question the captain from the 1st.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.140
Hello?! Is there anyone alive up here?!

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:02.120
Yo. I took care of anyone getting in our way.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.460
I need your attention, Devil's Footprints.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:07.560
Huh?

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:14.390
That fire that happened to you 12 years ago-- would you like to know about it?

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.810
What?

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.640
Who... are you?

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.070
You'd like to know right? About the fire your mother and brother died in?

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.480
About the day you became a devil?

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.690
How do you know about that?! Who are you?!

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.700
Get away from those crewmen!

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.850
Huh? What? You're more worried about these two than hearing about the fire?

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.380
You Fire Soldiers...

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.720
Okay, so you can't give me your attention.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.600
Well then, guess I'll kill them.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:03.890
Stop!

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.110
Ho...

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.360
Whoa...

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.160
What do you know about the fire? Tell me.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.870
If you entertain me, I'll tell you.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.050
So, let's see how many moves you can last.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.620
Ashes?

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.420
Well, that was surprisingly easy.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.540
Guess I'll kill you.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.620
H-

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.340
He's gonna kill me...

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.650
Wow, that's a hell of a look on your face.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:36.110
You can still smile, even in this situation? You're better than I thought.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:41.490
As a reward, I'll give you your first hint about the truth of that fire.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.060
Your younger brother...

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.790
...is still alive.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.460
What? Sho is alive?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.340
What do you mean?! Sho was burned to death, bones and all!

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.510
And besides, if he's alive, where has he been since the fire?!

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.350
At the time, Sho was still a one-year-old baby!

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.230
You think maybe someone is hiding something?

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.520
There's no way I could believe something like that!

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.070
What's the matter? Did that ring a bell?

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.710
Even if it's true, how would you know about it?

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.960
Why would you tell me about it?

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.050
What are you after? Why did you come all the way up here?!

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.090
So now you're deeply intrigued by me. Very good.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.510
You do show a lot of promise, after all.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:52.440
And from the way you're acting, do you have suspicions about the Fire Force?

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.730
Your mother died; that's nothing to sneeze at.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.110
You want to know the truth, don't you?

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.910
Are you ready to stop playing hero, and seek out the truth

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.080
by joining me as a devil?

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.040
Be a hero or a devil, you say?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:18.210
Screw you! No matter what you know, you still assaulted two Fire Soldiers!

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.420
I'm gonna kick your ass and take you in!

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.220
Well, this is disappointing.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.810
That flying kick of yours leaves you wide open.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.860
Heroes always do flying kicks!

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:51.000
That's incredible, isn't it? That's the firepower of the Devil!

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.950
Whoa, that startled me!

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.580
I'm sensing something icky up ahead.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.540
I'm picking up a whiff of some awfully nasty danger.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.250
I am not a knight-shaped seat cushion. Hurry up and move.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.590
What are you doing underneath me, you sicko?!

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.080
I'm not a knight-shaped punching bag, either.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.760
Hey!

00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.810
Watch out!

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.190
I let this drag on too long, and now we're being interrupted.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.740
Sorry to keep you waiting, "Infernal."

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:08.740
Arthur!

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.030
A suspicious man has snuck into the games facility!

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.370
He's brought harm to two crewmen who are now injured!

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.000
Go report this to the captains outside!

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.030
What?!

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.420
Don't lie to me. I'm gonna be the winner.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.670
Huh?!

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.050
I'm gonna catch him!

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.010
Oh, you stupid knight!

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.010
How do you plan to catch me by waving that sword around?

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.940
Don't forget about me!

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.670
Caught you!

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.830
They're taking things this far in the Rookie Games?

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.660
Like I told you, the competition is on hold!

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.290
Shinra, if you insist on being a hero,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.720
then go ahead and try to rescue every last person here.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:09.720
More of those ashes?

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.250
What are those?

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:15.890
Ashes?

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:24.230
Later, Devil. If you ever feel like joining the Joker, I'll take you in.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.300
Good luck with this.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.530
We have to get out of here, now! It's gonna explode!

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.210
Arthur, cut through the ceiling! We'll head upward!

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.920
Only beautiful princesses may give orders to a knight.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:58.350
Hmph, my cuts were too brilliant to let the ceiling fall down.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.930
Move it! We're busting through the ceiling, right?

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.400
Grab on, both of you!

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.410
I'm saving them all!

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.000
Are you a hero, or are you a devil?

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.050
Damn it all, Fire Soldiers are heroes!

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.420
Arthur! Cat lady!

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.490
Save me!

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.980
God have mercy.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.980
Captain Burns!

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.490
You get those two safely down on the ground.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:55.660
Right!

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.530
Um, what about me?

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.200
Look down.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.750
Don't punk out, Arthur!

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.960
Show us that 8th spirit!

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.090
That 8th spirit? All I'm doing is freefalling.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.600
Ow...

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.750
It's lucky for me you're all so musclebound.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.390
Who are you calling a gorilla cyclops?!

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.650
I never said that!

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.200
Is there anyone hurt?!

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.780
Hurry and evacuate!

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.460
It looks as though you took care of Tamaki, here.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.210
I could have gotten out of there by myself.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.180
Shinra, wasn't it? Thanks.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.440
Your praise is more than I deserve. Thank you very much.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.480
Shinra! Are you okay?!

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:09.730
I saw that! You saved all four of them! You're a hero, you know that?

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.180
Thank you very much!

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.240
All right, we'll be going now.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.360
Tamaki, tell me what happened in there.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:24.750
Yes, sir!

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.950
That's a good man you've got there.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.550
I ran into a suspicious man inside.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.960
Someone who could control explosions with a mysterious powder.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.810
The explosions were a lot like the ones at that fire scene the other day.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.570
The man seemed to know something.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.610
Captain, is the Special Fire Force hiding something?

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.620
Shinra...

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.810
The Special Fire Force really is fighting for the good of the people, right?

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.300
I became a Fire Soldier to keep people safe.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.890
Fire Soldiers really are heroes who fight the flame terror, right?

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.980
Yes, they are. On the other hand,

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.730
the Special Fire Force isn't exactly one monolithic organization.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.320
The Fire Force was formed by combining personnel from three bodies--

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.450
the Holy Sol Temple, the Tokyo Armed Forces, and the Fire Defense Agency.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:47.460
Moreover, each of them has different levels of influence at each company.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.520
The influence of the Holy Sol Temple is strong at the 1st.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.460
The 2nd reports directly to the Tokyo Armed Forces.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:01.100
At the 5th, the real power is held by Haijima Industries.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.770
Haijima?

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.050
How is Haijima in so deep?

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:10.810
All of the equipment that we use is made by Haijima.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:14.770
The Special Fire Force could not operate without Haijima.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.290
They have a monopoly on product orders,

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.330
and control vast amounts of capital and interests.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.410
Of course, each company's duty is to put Infernals to rest,

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.830
to seek out the cause of spontaneous human combustion,

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.850
and fight on behalf of the people.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:35.420
However, each company keeps the information they find out to themselves,

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.760
and nothing is shared.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:42.840
Some of it may be information about the truth behind human combustion.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.680
I believe it to be a just organization,

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.560
but there may be some companies that have their own dubious motives.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:55.520
Since I can't completely trust them, I'm also suspicious of the Fire Force.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.980
Then, sir, what is our objective at the 8th?

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.580
We at the 8th are a body

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.740
that some on the Fire Defense Agency strong-armed into creation,

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.700
with me as its captain, comprised of members that they could trust--

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:16.710
to investigate Companies 1 through 7, and zero in on the truth.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.460
Does that mean...?

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:24.090
The Special Fire Force should already know the cause of the Infernals.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.680
I want to find what it is, and save people.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.350
Please allow me to help you with that investigation, sir.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.260
Thanks. I'm glad I called you into the 8th.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.960
"To be continued"

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.840
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.880
and curse the unwavering present,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.010
but words that simply hang in the air

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.770
are not enough to save you

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.070
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.240
between sights we never reach

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.450
and pain that brings no warmth

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.580
to make it to a faraway place

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.840
Given the hope that you speak of

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.050
or the ideals that you dream of

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:50.800
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.060
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.020
and curse the unwavering present,

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.230
but words that simply hang in the air

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:06.820
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.860
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.080
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.200
I hope we can still walk together again

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.420
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.130
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.430
"Next time"

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:35.480
"Episode 4: The Hero and the Princess"
