00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:08.610
Causes of death are many and varied. Old age, suicide, illness...

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.240
But the cause of death that scares the most people in this day and age...

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.460
"Episode 9: The Spreading Malice"

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.750
The children are trying so hard!

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.260
You were supposed to take the fall for this crime!

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.220
What's become of you, Tamaki?!

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.850
--I used to like you. --Tamaki! What's become of you?!

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.680
--Tamaki! What's become of you?!

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.350
--Why are you doing this, Lieutenant Rekka...? --You aren't the Tamaki I thought you were!

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.350
--Why are you doing this, Lieutenant Rekka...?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.360
Status update!

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.650
One Infernal has appeared.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.450
There's a fire in the city limits. Let's hurry!

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.160
Tamaki, can you keep up?

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.370
Y-Yes, sir! I'm fine!

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.000
There's an Infernal nearby. Be sure you stay with us!

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.710
Yes, Lieutenant Rekka!

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.650
There it is!

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.180
Let me handle this!

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.550
Hold it, Rekka! Don't rush into rushing in!

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100
The flame...

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.110
...is the soul's breath.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.030
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.400
--Return to... --Return to...

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.610
--...the great flame... --...the great flame...

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.640
--...of fire! --...of fire!

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.620
Látom.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.920
Honestly, you're always so reckless.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.940
Because you always have my back, Karim.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.430
That's because you charge ahead on your own.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.680
My stars!

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.510
You can't just laugh it off, not even with that smile.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.760
My stars?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.770
My stars!

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560
--Quit flashing that flashy smile!

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.480
--They all rely on each other. That's so cool! --Quit flashing that flashy smile!

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.980
--They all rely on each other. That's so cool!

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.110
Die now, Tamaki!

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.930
Stop, Lieutenant Rekka...

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.320
Help me...

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.200
Are you okay, Tamaki?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.840
The darkness is illuminated

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.470
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.180
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.600
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.260
The end is illuminated

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.850
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.600
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.980
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.820
Flames rise to show us the way

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.490
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.960
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.210
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.930
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.760
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.810
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.360
Playthings that make sounds

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.070
and magic that chases pain away

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.150
are all precious treasures to me

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.780
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.710
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.550
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.380
My stars!

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.930
Kusakabe!

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.440
Rekka Hoshimiya, you're the culprit, aren't you?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.110
Do not interfere!

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.410
Star Fist Jab!

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.630
Rekka Hoshimiya! Now that the hero,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.380
Catch-the-Artificial-Infernal-Maker Man is here,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.100
there's nowhere for you to retreat!

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.890
My stars!

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.850
I don't need to retreat! I only ever move forward!

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.820
Then I'm Keep-You-from-Moving- Backwards-or-Forwards Man!

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.760
Kusakabe is fighting toe-to-toe against Lieutenant Rekka...

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.510
I will not allow anyone to interfere with our evangelism!

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.220
Shut up, you hot-blooded son of a bitch.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.640
Oh, no trouble for me. It just means one more dead body.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.290
It's reacting to Shinra Kusakabe's flames.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.780
I get it. It's trying to go back to the flames.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.370
All right! This is my lucky day!

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.370
So this is where you are--the third person the Evangelist is searching for.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.330
Click!
"Click"

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.470
The undefiled flame, the Adolla Burst!

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.020
Adolla Burst?

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.330
What we who serve under the Evangelist have been seeking.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.010
That which can only be borne by the spawn of the great Sol--

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.940
the sacred flame that will lead mankind!

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.990
The pure, unadulterated flame.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.200
For a long time, I have been lighting pilot lights in children,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.670
in search of someone compatible, but imagine, finding someone right here!

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.420
In children, you say?

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.550
Exactly how many people have you turned into Infernals?

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.390
It doesn't matter.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.770
They were trivial sacrifices so that we could achieve our goal.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.020
Screw you!

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.900
You think you can get away with this?!

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.490
What are you doing, you sicko?!

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.100
S-Sorry!

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.330
O-Okay, then, off I go.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.480
Don't walk away with my skirt!

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.090
Star Fist Jab!

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.340
Let me show you the difference in our firepowers!

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:15.970
Tamaki!

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.500
My stars!

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.030
Sorry! It's not like that! I didn't mean to!

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.120
Enough already, just fight!

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.950
R-Right.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.080
Please, Kusakabe...

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.370
Defeat Lieutenant Rekka.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.270
Leave him to me. That's why I'm here.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.790
Hmph.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.570
Rekka and my firepowers are about the same, or mine is a bit lower.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.300
But where I do have him beat is with my feet.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.740
My mobility.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.800
This building is an excellent place to capitalize on my mobility.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.840
Time to put it to the test.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.550
My stars!

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.640
I will burn everything up with my hot arms! My stars!

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.930
Don't let him beat you!

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.690
What awesome firepower. My knee is hot just by glancing off him.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.320
I'll shoot you down!

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.210
Star Fist...

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.920
...Jab!

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.880
I outmatch you in mobility!

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.090
You only have a single foothold,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.600
but for me, everything is a foothold!

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.560
My stars...

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.560
Guys, gather around! Make sure to keep behind the pillars!

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.420
I'm coming there now!

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.430
Tak-kun!

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.950
Are you okay, Kusakabe?!

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.870
I flew all the way here, and then started fighting right off.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.340
I'm a little lightheaded. Looks like I overused my pyrokinesis.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.010
You're overheated. You've used up too much of your body's oxygen,

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.430
the source of your flames.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:02.660
It's over, Rekka Hoshimiya. Give yourself up, nice and easy.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.740
I finally found a compatible child.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.120
For the Evangelist's sake, he's not getting away!

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.270
For what reason are you turning children into Infernals?

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.590
Are there any more like you?

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.050
And who is this "Evangelist"?

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:31.600
I find compatible children and increase the number of us with abilities.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.440
We'll create Infernals, and return people back to flames.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.070
All according to the will of the Evangelist.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.290
What is your objective?

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.080
Behold the brilliance of the star of flames ensconced in the heavens!

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.750
We will return to the bosom of the great Sol!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.670
Turn all people into flames, and engulf the earth in the great flame of fire!

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.720
Incinerate this imperfect earth and its humanity in the flames of salvation!

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.640
And turn this world into a second sun!

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.020
What... are you talking about?

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.480
To make the world a star!

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.320
Guys, we're getting out of here, now!

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.070
They won't get away!

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.990
I'll take them, and make it look like they died in the fire!

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.540
They will receive the teachings of the Evangelist while in their childhood!

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.130
In the fire...? While in their childhood...?

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.420
Did you guys... take my brother, too?!

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:50.910
Burn, my Star Fists! Burn with fervor!

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.220
Stop! You'll be burned by your own flames!

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.400
I will burn all of you up before I am consumed!

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.230
Látom!

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.000
What the...?!

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.240
Didn't you always say I was there at your back?

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.370
Karim!

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.080
Do not interfere!

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:21.790
Stop. The hotter you get, the more I'll cool you off.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.380
I'll just vaporize this ice!

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:33.060
Fire!

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.550
I wasn't always at your back so you could go and do something like this.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.160
I heard the report, and what do I come here and see?

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.780
Karim, what in the world?

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.620
I put Rekka on lockdown. We'll get all there is to know out of him later.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.420
Is the 1st going to be all right?

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.920
This is nothing more than my hunch,

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.130
but I get the feeling this isn't just the 1st's problem.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.340
It's a much more whopping whopper of a problem, affecting the whole nation.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:15.970
What?!

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:16.680
Huh?

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.360
Rekka's been...

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.070
Lieutenant Rekka...

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.360
Direct hit on target. Hoshimiya has been eliminated.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.700
There are still Fire Soldiers there. Take some of them out.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:42.950
Acknowledged.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.000
Again?!

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.050
A sniper!

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.760
Where did it come from?!

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.670
I missed.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.180
They won't escape this one.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:57.510
Karim!

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.360
Shinra! Put up a smokescreen!

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:08.280
Right!

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.950
Tamaki! Stay out of sight there with the children!

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:14.490
Yes, sir!

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.210
Huo Yan, I'm sorry.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:27.980
Karim, you're the 1st's shield. We can't afford to lose you here.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.260
Who needs a shield that has to be protected?

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.300
I can't afford to let anyone else get hurt.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.850
Shinra! Can you identify the enemy?!

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.690
Two targets, on the roof of the building to the southwest!

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:49.690
Tamaki!

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.200
On Shinra's signal, extend as much of your flame as you can toward the target!

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.620
It'll give away your position, so extend them higgledy-piggledy!

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.490
Yes, sir!

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.160
I've lost visual on the target.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.160
Karim, what's the point of the ice?

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.100
We're showing them that we know where they are,

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.350
while constructing a barrier to block their view of us.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.810
If we behave in a manner incomprehensible to them,

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.850
it's up to them to interpret the reason, and get freaked out.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.360
Snipers do their work from a safe place, after all.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.320
It looks like our location has been exposed.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.620
Sniping will be impossible with all that smoke and ice.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.050
We've silenced Hoshimiya.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.670
Now is not the time to expose ourselves to danger by fighting.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.050
We'll report this to the commander. We're withdrawing.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.380
The targets are falling back! Should I go after them?

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.970
With you overheated, you'll just get yourself killed by them.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.890
All we can do is stay here hunched down like turtles.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.690
Let them get the wrong idea and be freaked out, and they'll run away.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:15.650
They made a hell of a scene. Who are those white-clad folks?

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.950
There are people turning others into Infernals and killing them,

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.030
as well as setting fires, running around.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.810
Among them are children they've abducted, who possess abilities.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.750
Including my brother.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.710
"The Evangelist." I now have someone I can go after.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.220
Tamaki, is that all of the children?

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:37.810
Yes, sir.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.230
Cover yourself.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.140
Oh, no! I couldn't possibly...

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.670
It's okay, just cover yourself.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.240
Thank you very much.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:06.260
Remember, Tamaki, while he may have tricked you, you need to be prepared.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.240
Yes, sir. I brought the children into this.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.030
I will accept any punishment you give.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.320
Thanks for your help with Rekka.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.850
I'm not sure if Rekka was hot-blooded and became a son of a bitch,

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.190
or if he was just a son of a bitch who became hot-blooded.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.510
But for me, Rekka was just Rekka.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.700
I need to find out why he was a hot-blooded son of a bitch.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.330
The 8th's objective is to do an internal investigation of Fire Soldiers, right?

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.740
And you're going after the Evangelist next?

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:56.190
I'm going to track down the Evangelist, too. Let me work with you.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.470
Thank you very much.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.010
"To be continued"

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.850
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.900
and curse the unwavering present,

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.020
but words that simply hang in the air

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.780
are not enough to save you

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.080
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.250
between sights we never reach

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.470
and pain that brings no warmth

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.590
to make it to a faraway place

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.850
Given the hope that you speak of

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.060
or the ideals that you dream of

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:57.820
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.070
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.030
and curse the unwavering present,

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.240
but words that simply hang in the air

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:13.830
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.880
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.090
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.220
I hope we can still walk together again

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.470
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.180
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.980
The 1st was swamped with reports and follow-ups after the incident with Rekka,

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.260
so our training got canceled.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.600
Rekka is dead,

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.200
Arthur ended up getting lost running down Rekka,

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.540
and a search request had to be issued for him.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.580
"Tardiness is forbidden"

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:58.330
I haven't been back at the 8th in so long... It was a short appointment,

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.710
"Submit your paperwork by tomorrow!" "Tardiness is forbidden"

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.450
but it still feels like coming home.
"Spinach is fundamental" "Submit your paperwork by tomorrow!" "Tardiness is forbidden"

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:00.880
"Spinach is fundamental" "Submit your paperwork by tomorrow!"

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.440
The captain's workouts...

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.840
"Head Spa"
The lieutenant's weird hats...

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.970
The basically cool and beautiful Maki-san...

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.600
I'm leaving some tea for you here.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.100
Nice work on your training assignment.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.100
Thank you very much.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.400
The sister's angelic smile...

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.950
I only joined the 8th a little while ago,

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:33.870
but somehow or other, it's become a place where I feel settled in.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:40.000
Wh-What are you doing here, cat lady?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.040
What!

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.050
Tamaki has been put on suspension at the 1st for the time being,

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.650
for her part in the Hoshimiya incident.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.640
While she's on suspension, the 8th is taking her.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.600
With the two of you together,

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.310
filing a report on this incident will be a lot easier.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.890
I-I see.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:05.440
Th-That being the case, Tamaki, could I get your phone number?

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:12.370
Wh-Why should I have to give you my phone number?!

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.950
W-Well, if you insist, I suppose I could tell you.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.790
Really? Man, Juggernaut has really been begging me.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:24.960
No way! I'm not telling!

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:35.810
There's an intruder in my haven. And after Arthur cleared out, too.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.110
Hmph.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.490
"Next time"

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:58.540
"Episode 10: The Promise"
