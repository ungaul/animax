WEBVTT

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.020
"Tokyo, Chuo-ku"

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.770
"Holy Sol Temple, Imperial Seat"

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.490
"Imperial Throne Room"

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.110
Your Excellency, there is no need for you to appear personally.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.490
While this situation can certainly not be ignored, you can allow us to...

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.030
It's all right. Assemble the captains from all the companies.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.920
Goodness.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.090
What have we here?

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.800
"Muscle-brain" "Gorilla" "Give Shinra a raise!!!"

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.470
Shinra!

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.310
My locker has been violated again! Enough, already!

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.400
I didn't do anything, sir!

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.400
Shinra is eating the lunch that I made for him. Don't interrupt.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.530
Is this your doing again? What is the captain of the 5th even doing here?

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.250
I was going to go to the captains' conference together with you.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.830
D-Don't get the wrong idea.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.750
When I bought the sweet roll to fill up on before the conference,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750
I'd forgotten about my lunch.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.300
I couldn't eat it by myself, and it's a shame to waste it.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.970
So I had no choice but to give it to Shinra.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.430
That's not what I was asking about.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.550
Shinra!

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.470
Do something about this girl!

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.270
Huh? But, sir, the lunch is really good.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.170
Oh, yeah? It's good, is it?

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.810
Damn it, she's baiting him.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.530
I'll treat you to as much ramen as you like sometime soon!

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.650
Ramen, you say?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.490
I'm coming, too.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.170
What are you doing back?

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.910
Huh?

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.370
I'm coming, too.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.370
Captain, run!

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.040
What happened to her "lucky"?

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.840
Hey, Maki, do you want any--

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.890
Hinawa, they're playing with fire inside the office.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.850
I need to confirm the route to Central.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.140
Stop it, you idiot! You skirt-devil!

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.400
You did that yourself!

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.500
Farewell, skirt-devil.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.610
There's a delicious bakery near here.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.450
Ah, nee-san, that's an old one. Of course we know of it.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.160
They just started selling something new, with strawberries on it!

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.330
This place sure has gotten lively.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.880
The darkness is illuminated

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.510
The days we've grown accustomed to walking are weeded out

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.220
My dream might be to make a stable living

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.640
but I'll moan over the lack of stimulation

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.310
The end is illuminated

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.890
Where are the streets we're accustomed to walking?

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.650
Time can sometimes be irksome,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.030
but we're enveloped in warmth

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.860
Flames rise to show us the way

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.540
reminding us of a gentle melody

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.000
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.260
I just smile, thinking that's fine with me

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.970
If we shine, someday, our light will go out

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.810
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.850
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.400
Playthings that make sounds

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.110
and magic that chases pain away

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.200
are all precious treasures to me

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.830
There is no eternity, none at all, they say

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.750
We'll keep on walking until the day

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.590
the fire of our lives gets doused

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.600
Are you sure it's okay for Tamaki and me to attend, sir?

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.520
The topic of this conference is the Evangelist

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.390
and the White-Clad organization.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.020
Having been directly involved, we're going to need your reports.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.230
Do all the captains meet together often?

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.910
No, not once since I took command of the 8th.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.200
That should tell you how urgent a matter this is.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.960
Man-made Infernals...

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.760
Direct hit on target. Hoshimiya has been eliminated.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.640
We'll report this to the commander. We're withdrawing.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.520
The White-Clad...

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.930
Click!
"Click!"

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.890
Behold the brilliance of the star of flames ensconced in the heavens!

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.440
We will return to the bosom of the great Sol!

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.320
Turn all people into flames, and engulf the earth in the great flame of fire!

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.410
Incinerate this imperfect earth and its humanity in the flames of salvation!

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.790
All according to the will of the Evangelist.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.040
And the Evangelist...

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.500
There's no doubt we're closing in on the cause behind Infernals appearing.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.970
Ah! Is that, by any chance...?

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.720
What, Kusakabe, you've never seen it before?

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.850
That's the power station that was built at the beginning of the Solar calendar.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.310
Amaterasu, the perpetual thermal energy plant.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.320
"The perpetual thermal energy plant Amaterasu"

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.030
Amaterasu produces all of the energy for Tokyo.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.910
All from that one facility? It must have out-of-this-world firepower.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.670
Thanks for everything you did the other day.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.630
No, I should be the one to thank you.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.810
Company 1 Lieutenant Karim Flam.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.850
I heard all about what happened from Shinra.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.110
I want to learn the truth about Rekka. I intend to work with the 8th on that.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.570
I hear you're a capable man. Thanks.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.250
I thought you were supposed to be with Haijima, like me.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.380
What are you talking about?

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.090
It looks to me like you're spending a lot of time with the 8th.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.130
Hmph, you're being ridiculous.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.510
The captains' conference is about to start.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.940
"Special Fire Force Company 1 Captain" "Leonard Burns"

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.400
"Special Fire Force Company 2 Captain" "Gustav Honda"

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.400
"Special Fire Force Company 3 Captain" "Dr. Giovanni"

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.360
"Special Fire Force Company 4 Captain" "Soichiro Hague"

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.160
"Special Fire Force Company 5 Captain" "Princess Hibana"

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.120
"Special Fire Force Company 6 Captain" "Kayoko Huang"

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.880
"Special Fire Force Company 7 Captain" "Benimaru Shinmon"

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.760
"Special Fire Force Company 8 Captain" "Akitaru Obi"

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.590
The 7th is here, and they normally don't show up to anything.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.900
This really is a big deal.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.660
So that man is the renowned mightiest Fire Soldier of all?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.530
The 7th's captain...?

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.320
What's so funny, you little brat?

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.660
Waka...

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.420
Hey, Kusakabe!

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.820
Each company's captain seems to be here.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.600
"Tokyo Empire Emperor" "Raffles III"

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.990
All right, let's begin this emergency conference.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.310
I've spoken with the general of the Tokyo Army

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.440
and the chief of the Fire Defense Agency.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.160
They say that there are some who are acting in secret to threaten our nation.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.080
Their actions defile the divine protection granted to us by the great Sol.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.370
All companies of the Special Fire Force,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.710
you are to bring down the Evangelist as a traitor.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.420
"Great Sol" my ass. What a load.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.420
Benimaru Shinmon! Your disrespect is beyond the pale!

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.640
Apologize to the emperor before the punishment of Gustav Honda befalls you!

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.100
Shut up, Honda Gustav. My name is Shinmon Benimaru.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.730
A proto-national name... So you're a proto-nationalist.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:12.530
We in the 7th are a gang of idiots who used to just be the neighborhood watch.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.570
I don't remember swearing an oath of loyalty to the empire or to Sol.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.950
The 7th will do whatever we want.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.540
Hold it! We aren't finished talking yet!

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.620
Stop right there!

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.800
Ahem.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:38.390
In any case, all companies are to come together to pursue the Evangelist.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.770
This will indeed be the path to save humanity from the flame terror.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.850
You're getting closer, aren't you?

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.770
Devil's Footprints...

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.240
That was surprisingly quick. He's got some potential.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.950
Maybe I'll go and see him again.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.390
Shinra Kusakabe-kun... Yes, Your Excellency?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.870
I understand you possess an Adolla Burst.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.920
That is what Rekka Hoshimiya told me, sir.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.220
What exactly is an Adolla Burst?

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.310
It is an unsullied, pure flame.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:28.190
The primordial flame, and the spark that Sol used when creating this world.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.650
Did you happen to see it on your way here?

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.070
Amaterasu, the perpetual thermal energy plant.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:41.200
The source flame that provides all of the energy for the Tokyo Empire.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.870
That flame is no more or less than an Adolla Burst.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.800
The Evangelist is seeking to obtain Adolla Bursts.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.970
An Adolla Burst is a flame of high purity,

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.370
but how it differs from a common flame cannot be scientifically explained.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.690
Could the Evangelist have discovered what the difference is?

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.860
The Evangelist will be coming for Kusakabe.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.320
Shouldn't we keep him secured?

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.320
Secured?! Please, sir, anything but that!

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.950
Fire Soldiers are here to protect people!

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.330
I can keep myself safe!

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:28.790
The other companies ought not interfere with the 8th's matters.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.250
Each company should be devoting themselves to pursuing the Evangelist.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.630
The 3rd wants to make Shinra their specimen.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.840
The 8th accepts the responsibility to keep Kusakabe safe and secure.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:54.980
An Adolla Burst is a sacred flame of God's chosen. Take good care of it.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.200
Yes, Your Excellency!

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.320
Goodness.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.660
We're back.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.950
We've returned.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.990
Welcome home. I'll make some tea.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.000
Wearing these funny clothes is exhausting.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.250
Um, sir? Wasn't Shinra-san with you, too?

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.880
Yeah. Shinra said he wanted to see Amaterasu on his own.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.220
And, if we have to mobilize, I'll cover for him somehow.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.800
Plus, Tamaki and Arthur are here.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.890
Hmph, the guy's making work for me.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.630
If the Evangelist is going to come seeking me out,

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.570
that works for me just fine.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.620
Long time no see, Devil's Footprints.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.050
You!

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.930
An Adolla Burst. One of those is a primordial flame,

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.800
which serves as the power source for Amaterasu.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.970
The sacred flame that created this world.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.470
But then, that flame is also the cause of the world's downfall.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.900
Whoa! I'm not in the mood for fisticuffs right now.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.610
But if you insist, I'd be willing to take you on.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:32.550
You don't actually think you can get a lick in, do you?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.630
I came to tell you something you'll want to hear today.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.840
A reward for the devil who certainly has gotten closer to the truth.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.180
You've just about stumbled upon the location of your brother, haven't you?

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.560
What are you trying to say?

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.520
Keep on pursuing the Evangelist. That's where you'll find your brother.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.530
Commander of the Knights of the Ashen Flame, in service to the Evangelist,

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.240
Sho Kusakabe. Your brother.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:16.160
Sho serves under the Evangelist... as a commander... of an order of knights?

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.880
What do you mean?!

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.670
Joker!

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.930
Hell is a perfect fit for a devil.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:45.580
Mom... Sho... I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.780
Mom... Sho...

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.340
Mom...

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.730
But I will keep another promise.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.310
If what he says is really true,

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.380
I'm going to have to fight with my brother.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.550
I'm going to become a superhero and protect Mom and Sho!

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.850
The promise I made to Mom is a promise that will keep Mom and Sho and me...

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.240
...will keep our family bound together!

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.270
No matter what, I will keep that promise!

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.780
"Episode 10: The Promise"

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:43.080
"Arthur"    "Shinra"     "Obi"     "Hinawa"

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.720
The Special Fire Force is going after the Evangelist.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.550
Let's start by looking for clues in the data from all the fires that have happened so far.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.060
This is just a fraction of it all.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.730
Find any detail that may relate to the White-Clad, no matter how minute.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.560
The Evangelist and the White-Clad

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.190
are artificially causing human combustion for some purpose.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.400
We cannot allow a single one of them to get away with it.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.570
I'll leave you to it.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.390
Hey, Shinra, hurry up and find a lead.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.230
All this mental heavy lifting is making you pale.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.360
So keep it up until it kills you.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.290
Like watching a candle in the wind. Good.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.460
Let's take a little break.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:11.010
Huh? But Arthur is on the verge of dying. Let's keep going!

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:17.300
The sister should be getting back from consoling the next of kin.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.350
How about the women go cook something for us to eat?

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.720
I'll do it!

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.060
Is that okay, Lieutenant?

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.020
You guys? I have my misgivings...

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.980
Jeez, how rude. It'll be fine.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.940
Maki-san's cooking!

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.070
What is this...?

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.530
Maki-san!

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.830
Hey! Kusakabe, no peeking!

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.710
How in the blue blazes did you end up like that?

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.830
You were wearing coveralls just a second ago!

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.300
That kind of conventional thinking doesn't apply to Tamaki.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.550
Ugh... Maki, go get Tamaki changed and get back to work.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.010
I'll make supper.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.390
Shinra, you're helping.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.270
Huh? O-Okay...

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.670
You okay?

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:31.330
Huh?

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.420
If it's too hard to talk to me, you can always tell the captain.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.390
I like it here at the 8th.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.310
I'd like you new guys to be able to trust us at the 8th, too.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.860
Lieutenant Hinawa, I also love it here at the 8th.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.280
I do trust you and Captain Obi.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.740
Thank you very much.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.000
I see.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.380
The food is ready! Please come to the dining room!

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.340
Yay!

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.430
Tch.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.730
How does Shinra seem?

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.690
The strain on him after the 5th and the 1st investigations has been tough.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:46.830
You didn't recruit any fragile members into the 8th, sir. He's fine.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.290
Awesome! You made this, Kusakabe?

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.460
No, it was mostly the lieutenant.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.180
Thank you for this food!

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.640
Thank you for this food.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.850
Make sure to chew before you swallow.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.030
Thank goodness. Things are the same as always.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.950
Things had been weird ever since you got back.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.040
I thought maybe your stomach was upset,

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.420
but if you're eating that much, you must be fine.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.390
I know this is sudden, but there's something I have to say.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.860
The truth is...

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.320
I told them. About meeting with Joker.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.120
About my brother, Sho.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.580
It would be fine sharing with my friends at the 8th.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:13.720
That's what I thought.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.000
I see.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.420
But this is coming from Joker, right? Can we even trust it?

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.630
I still don't believe it, myself.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.800
In that case... Shinra...

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.980
Do you want to believe your brother is still alive, or not?

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.940
I want to believe it!

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.110
Sure you do.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.530
In that case, we have no choice but to believe it, as well.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.160
It doesn't change our mission to go after the Evangelist,

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.290
but we're going to form our strategy around the premise

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:55.370
that Shinra's brother is still alive.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.910
Thank you very much, sir.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:07.590
A light to those who are lost. To burn the land,

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:14.270
and turn this world to a flaming sun wherein God may be enshrined.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:19.230
As the Evangelist directs.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.020
"To be continued"
Látom.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.860
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.910
and curse the unwavering present,

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.030
but words that simply hang in the air

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.790
are not enough to save you

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.100
We've been walking shoulder-to-shoulder

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.260
between sights we never reach

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.480
and pain that brings no warmth

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.610
to make it to a faraway place

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.860
Given the hope that you speak of

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.070
or the ideals that you dream of

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:13.830
I'll find a way to show you love, however cold you may be

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.080
You can toil your way through humorless days

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.040
and curse the unwavering present,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.250
but words that simply hang in the air

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:29.840
are not enough to save you You can cry out timidly

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.890
but that changes when the nights grow fevered

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.100
Even if we let go of each other's hands,

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.230
I hope we can still walk together again

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.480
I'll refrain from saying goodbye

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.190
to ensure that we can meet again somewhere

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.490
"Next time"
