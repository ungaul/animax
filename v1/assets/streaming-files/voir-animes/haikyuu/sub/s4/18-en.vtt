00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.950
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.130
And Sarukawa scores back-to-back points!

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.940
They've taken the lead for the first time halfway through the second set.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.470
It's annoying how they hit the ball where it's hard to receive.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.240
Even in situations where they might score if they go all-out,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.420
they're holding back on purpose.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.370
They've been skillfully weaving that strategy into this match.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.630
When you actually stand on the court and are facing your opponents' attacks,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.480
things might not go as you planned on the whiteboard.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.720
But they have the resilience to pull it off,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.730
as well as the smarts and calm to look at the match as a whole.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.230
You've got some great players there,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.220
Aritaka.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.450
Crush him...

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.630
Crush him...

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.270
That setter's been babied by having all the passes go right to him.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.330
Crush him...

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.550
Crush him!

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.960


00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.760
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.980
Haikyuu !
!
Haikyuu

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.240
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.110
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.490
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.780
'Cause if we give up now It'll all be over

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.270
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.800
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.470
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.410
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.050
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.560
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.240
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.170
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.170
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.690
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.560
So let's start smiling

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.010


00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.050
Episode Eighteen: Trap Episode Eighteen: Trap
Episode Eighteen: Trap Nice receive!

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.980
It's not that nice.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.330
Nice spike!

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.490
That was a bit low.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.500
Sorry.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.610
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma Yamamoto, number four,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.560
as well as Nekoma's two middle blockers, Kuroo, number one, and Haiba, number eleven, are all incredibly good.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.990
Sarukawa Tech is probably focusing most of their attention on those three.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.340
I'm sure that Sarukawa's blockers were on their guard here with Haiba,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.300
and that's how Fukunaga on the left got that point.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.140
Kenma, you look super tired!

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.300
Shut up.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.610
The... setter, is it?

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.390
If you guys knew that he was so weak, couldn't you guys have just ganged up on him too?

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.730
Uh, well, even if we were going to gang up on him, the setter usually touches the ball second.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.240
Ganging up on anyone else with your serves is a pretty good strategy.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.810
You need a lot of guts and persistence to put that much direct pressure on someone for that long.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.800
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.450
What's this? Did the setter, Kozume, trip over his own feet?

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.660
Lucky, lucky, Sarukawa! Lucky, lucky, Sarukawa!
Keep Standing Back Up

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.620
You do move around quite a bit as the setter.
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.590
That position is a lot more intense than it seems.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.550
Even if it may look like a repetition of simple points,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.510
they are still stacking up gradually.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.200
Five deflections instead of one time shutting them down with a block.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.480
Ten times applying pressure.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.820
Five B-passes you get up rather than one perfect A-pass.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.190
Or ten C-passes.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.630
The stronger our opponent,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.410
the more we have to look at the flow of the match as a whole.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.560
Stack up the 100 shots that don't stand out at the end, rather than the perfect point.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.450
Yes, sir!

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.790
You good?

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.800
Ugh, how lame...

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.790
This is only the second set.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.790
My hands are melting.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.460
No one ever looks cool when they're desperate.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.520
Could you not look so smug when you say that?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:42.250
Sarukawa definitely has the upper hand this set, so letting Kozume rest until the next set is an option.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.360
And look.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.690
Speak of the devil...

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.490
All right, just one more push.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.360
It's... out!

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.090
It's all good. Let's keep this up.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.170
Man, that was close!

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.650
They were aiming for a great spot, though.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.480
We still have control of the flow.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.870
Now's the time to keep pushing through.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.230
Don't rush it!

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.900
I touched it!

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.440
Someone get it!

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.360
Zawa!

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.540
What a nice receive!

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.710
It's short.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.920
Sarukawa Tech is calmly aiming for all the holes in their defense.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.630
Nekoma's getting sloppy!

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.060
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.890
Nekoma's catching up at the end of the set!

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.630
They've tied it up!

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.770
They were thrown off balance, but they got the ball to the right, where the blockers weren't as deep.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.530
They're starting to get used to us.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.920
But they're not perfect.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.900
Don't rush it.
Right!

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.740
Sorry about that!

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.750
It's fine!

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.830
Give us a good serve, Kura!

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.750
That serve floats just over the net.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.710
Up front!
Yaku!

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.750
Got it!

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.760
Did Nekoma's receive veer too far to the side?

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.970
Hey, come on, now. Get that ball up properly.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.810
Over here.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.530
Wait.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.870
They did that on purpose to lure our blockers away from the left.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.670
Stay there!

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.210
You figured it out?

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.620
Okay.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.040
Guess we're going right, then.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.010
Yeah!

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.960
Kai Nobuyuki scores from the right!

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.420
Connect
They're going after the right side, even though it's narrow.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.380
Sarukawa's blockers look a bit shocked too.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.850
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma
Kozume is a setter who doesn't stand out very much,

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.340
but he may be the one everyone needs to keep an eye out for.
It was short. I'm sorry.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.340
It's okay.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.960
They might've messed up that receive on purpose.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.710
To lure away the blockers, right?

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.030
Hey, wait... Then that means...

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.500
When did this start?

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:47.970
Haikyuu!!

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:40.960


00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.970
Connect

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.970
Looks like their team is trying to get Kenma to run around.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.070
Tokyo Nekoma Tokyo Nekoma Yeah.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.320
Huh? What?

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.310
What's that mean?

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.180
Inuoka... Well...

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.520
You know what an A-pass is, right?

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.350
Yeah.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.410
The receive goes back to the setter with an A-pass.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:10.010
Can we come up with some strategy where we win without me getting tired?

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.430
Yeah, right.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.370
Are you really Kenma? That was a dumb thing to say.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.030
In order to get past our opponents' guts and perseverance,

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.630
we're gonna have to be just as resilient.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.130
What?! Is that what they're trying to do?!

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.590
They sure are. It's pretty amazing.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.720
We'll get used to it.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.630
The receivers will, that is!

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.490
Yeah! We take care of our pampered little prince!

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.520
Nekoma knows how to keep our setter from moving much.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.520
But...

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.470
just seeing who can hold out longer isn't that much fun.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.150
Huh?

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.170
You mean you want us to do sloppy receives?

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.540
I mean, we use that strategy sometimes, but still...

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.280
Not every time, okay?

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.730
Just at the opportune times.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.680
I mean, we can get the ball up wherever you need it,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.370
but you're pretty exhausted already. Are you gonna make it?

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.630
I can move a little bit.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.640
I mean, I don't want to keep running to the end line and back every time,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.270
but you guys will have it harder than me.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:20.560
Since I'm telling you to get me the ball where I ask you to while getting used to Sarukawa's attacks.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.480
We can do this, though.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.710
You guys are all so determined to begin with.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.340
So, any other requests?

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.610
Get the ball up high.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.230
You got it!

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.330
Got it!

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:50.000
Those guys are probably watching out down the middle for Kuro and Lev.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.170
That means their blockers will try to head toward our middle blockers.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.770
And since their whole plan is to try to crush me,

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.850
they're totally going to fall for it.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.900
That these receives are just extra sloppy.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.520
Lure the blockers one way with the ball and our middle blockers,

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.030
then I'll set the ball to the exact opposite side.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.030
And once they realize what's going on... Stay there!

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.560
that's when we aim for the other side.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.030
Kai Nobuyuki scores from the right!

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.590
Nice, nice, Kai! Nice, nice, Kai! Do it again!

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.060
When did this start?

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.310
This might've just been a coincidence.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.510
Don't let this throw you off.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.370
Just think about winning this set.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.200
Right.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.610
Were they planning this from the start?

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.960
We thought we were manipulating them, but they were the ones who manipulated us?

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.420
They brought out the backup setter, but they don't seem to be putting him in.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.070
Was that to get our guard down?

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.540
Maybe Nekoma's setter wasn't as exhausted as we thought he was.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.750
You've got some great players, Aritaka.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:16.760
But as usual, things don't always go as they were planned on the whiteboard.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.430
Now doubt begets doubt.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.680
Well, isn't that some great timing.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.140

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.140
You guys didn't make a mistake.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:33.110
All that pressure you applied is working, and Nekoma's setter is definitely exhausted.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.940
We're up against a powerhouse school, so everything won't go according to plan, but we're hanging in there.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.250
Let's give them another push.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.280
Yes, sir!

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:52.390
If Nekoma was doing sloppy receives on purpose, it means they found out Sarukawa's plan to wear Kozume down,

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:56.570
and then they tired him out further to make this work.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.470
Are they friggin' sadists?

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.430
There's no easy victory here.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.150
Hey, I know what this is. It's a deuce.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:09.200
Uh, yeah... This is that, you know, really tough thing.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.250
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma Yeah.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:18.860
Nice receive!

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.240
You're the ones who'll suffer the longer this match goes on.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.410
Their plan was to gradually crush Kenma.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.040
Too bad we're Nekoma.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.070
We'll just get used to it.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.470
Nice receive!

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.310
Everything will be decided at the end of the second set.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.850
Everyone's used to what's going on.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.770
Don't rush it!

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.730
Meaning, the moment Sarukawa rushes to try to win,

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.110
we're going to score twice in a row and win the match.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.570
At least, that was the plan, and everything was going well up until now...

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.730
You're so damn stubborn!

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.330
Would you just... ...let the ball drop!

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.300
Keep Standing Back Up We're not going to lose...

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.990
...at persistence!

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.260
Connect Push it, push it, Nekoma!

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.220
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.930
Both teams are masters of defense and unwilling to back down.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.390
We can feel the tension from the court all the way up here!

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.270
I should've told them I'd work extra hard in the third set so they'd let me sit the second set out.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.040
Why is gravity a thing in this world? Gravity pisses me off.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.160
If gravity didn't exist, the ball wouldn't fall into our side of the court.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.310
Gravity is what causes the ball to fall and...

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.840
Kenma, concentrate.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.200
Curse you, gravity.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.960
Concentration's is the one trait Kenma has more than anyone else, and he's starting to lose it.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.290
Why do you exist, gravity? Gravity... Gravity...

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.290
He's reaching his limit.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.680
Tamahiko, warm back up.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.340
Yes, sir.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.390
Then what about you, huh?!

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.890
I don't wanna hear about guts from a gutless brat like you!

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:17.150
Ever since Tora said that to me, I wondered what guts really were.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.400
Guts...

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.560
I've always despised that word.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.280
I'm pretty sure society hates that word lately too.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.990
They make it sound like it just comes to you.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.090
But lately, I've been thinking...

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.460
Whether you love or hate how that word sounds,

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:45.670
it's actually a lot harder to show your guts than you'd think.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.440
Guts are probably a final move.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.680
Only those who have trained their bodies and souls can pull it off.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.230
Meaning, that's an ultimate move that I can't use.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.770
All of these rallies have been super long.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.650
I hit it!

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.820
Up front!

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.490
Get to the ball a half-step quicker.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.710
That half-step will allow you to control the ball.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.420
Their fatigue has definitely built up.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.500
And yet,

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.950
all of their plays are so careful.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.000
The fact that we might be baiting them and might attack from either side...

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.800
They're being super careful about all of that.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.980
And at times like this, you just go with a simple, fast set right down the middle.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:44.150
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.100
And there's the back-to-back points!

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.150
It was Nekoma that finally broke through their opponent's defense!

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.860
Nice, nice, Kuroo! Nice, nice, Kuroo!

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.410
You guys use guts or whatever.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.190
I'm pretty sure you somehow think that you can't.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:01.040
It's true that you always want to give up and try to find the easy way out.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.880
But...

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.090
it didn't matter if you were last or how much you complained.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.550
Whether or not our upperclassmen or coaches were watching,

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.550
you always saw it through until the end.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.100
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:25.980
Sorry!

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.520
Someone get that!

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.900
Right now,

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.750
Fukunaga's on the left.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:37.100
Fukunaga's good, so even if there are blockers, he'll still be able to score.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.120
So, is your high school's team good?

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.670
But I'm not good.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.710
We all are.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.920
He only does that after he's gotten an A-pass.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.790
Minimal movement...

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.200
into a perfect set!

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.270
Oh...

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.090
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma Sarukawa Tech
Nekoma Sarukawa Tech Nekoma
And there it is!

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:34.090
Nekoma

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:40.440
The team to finally break through their opponent's defense and end the long deuce was Nekoma High School!

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.690
What a great final play from Kozume.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.140
He didn't give the blockers a chance to read him at all. What an excellent set!

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.690
He really gave it his all.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.900
Nice one, son.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.830
Keep Standing Back Up Thank you very much!

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.750
Thank you very much!

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.920
We'll have to try harder next time.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.370
The masters of defense, Nekoma...

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.380
Compared to the past teams, or rather,

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.940
compared to what I imagined, this team was far more aggressive.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:25.080
Sometimes they're even more aggressive than I could imagine.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.030
However...

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.390
You were worthy opponents, Sarukawa Tech.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.710
You actually put in some effort today, Kenma.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:49.750
Who would've thought you'd come up with a plan to exhaust yourself even more?

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.790
I just pushed myself so we wouldn't have to play a third set.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.480
I never would've survived it under those conditions.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.930
Sarukawa would've crushed me completely.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.960
So, hey, Kenma. When you fell earlier, was that all an act?

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.780
Do you really think I could fake that?

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.350
R-Right...

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.500
You finally showed some guts, Kenma!

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.610
That's not it.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.880
I'm not at the level where I could use guts.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.570
What?

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.340
How do I put this?

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.700
I don't... I felt a sense of duty.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.020
Everyone was working so hard to get the ball back up.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.050
So I felt like I had to try too.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.470
I guess.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.680
And I'm trying to tell you, that's what guts is all—

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.610
Seriously, do you have to give someone's effort a name?

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.050
Is it that weird that I actually tried?!

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.050
Why are you so angry?!

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.000
I think I heard you getting mad at the air during our match.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.510
Your personality changes way too much when you're angry.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.920
You must be low on carbs.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.520
Have a banana.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.180
Is it so weird that I worked hard for my friends?!

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.230
Is it that weird for me to do that, huh?!

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.740
K-Kyanma!

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.660
The hell?!

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:08.070
Kyanma! My dear friend!

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.160
You're so extra, Yamamoto.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.710
Nah.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.870
It's pretty rare for Kenma to actually call a stranger a friend.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.930
Come get some!

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.070
Back off!

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.050
Fukunaga, don't jump in on this.
Wow, bananas.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.080
I'm just gonna take one.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:27.650
Now if only Kenma could be half as aggressive in volleyball as he gets when he's playing video games.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.150
Could you not try to narrate my thoughts? Thanks.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.650
Yeah, I hate guts.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.520
They're way too hard for me.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.940
But...

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.770
I definitely leveled up for this.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.880
If we're gonna do this,

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.660
I wanna fight a strong boss.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.280
I guess there's one guy Kenma actually gets aggressive against.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.880
Hell yeah!

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.790
Looks like Karasuno's up against the Miya Twins.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.800
Oh, hey! It looks like they already took the first set, though!

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.060
Hey, Karasuno.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.480
Nekoma (Tokyo)
Karasuno (Miyagi)

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.210
We're here.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.440
We made it this far.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:21.900


00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:28.790
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:35.540
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:52.230
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:58.730
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:04.740
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:10.750
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.450
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:22.300
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:28.310
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:34.060
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:40.230
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:51.910


00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:56.920
