WEBVTT

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.480
But I love how crispy they fry up all the salmon here!

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.700
Ryuu!

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.820
And I really like their rolled omelets.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.550
Nothing beats the unlimited rice!

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.270
I heard that Karasuno won.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.620
Congrats!

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.030
Th-Thanks.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.950
Um... So...

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.280
Let's both do our best tomorrow!

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.360
Well, see you later!

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.670
Yeah.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.080
You've definitely got a chance.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.010


00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.810
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.030
Haikyuu !
!
Haikyuu

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.280
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.160
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.540
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.830
If we give up now It'll all be over

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.320
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.850
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.520
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.460
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.100
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.610
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.290
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.210
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.220
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.740
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.610
So we're smiling for now

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.970


00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.520
Jaybird Inn Episode Sixteen: Broken Heart

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.320
Episode Sixteen: Broken Heart Man, no fair.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.980
Tanaka's finally got himself a cute girlfriend.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.980
Wh-Why would you say that?!

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.490
Is having a chance the issue here?!

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.530
You're not supposed to go for a girl you don't have a chance with?!

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.050
Uh, what?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.030
A girl you don't have a chance with? You mean Shimizu?

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.990
I-I mean, am I just supposed to go for them because there's a chance?!

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.390
Yeah, I get it!

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.690
I really do!

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.830
Having a bunch of pretty ladies say, "Let's play beach volleyball together! Whoops! I dove right into you!"

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.900
Yes, please!

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.720
Of course, I want a beautiful girl my age to cheer me on too!

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.240
But that's different!

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.930
Something tells me this is different!

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.980
Yeah, we know that's how you are.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.560
We knew it from the day you joined.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.660
Wow. I guess he's on the volleyball team too.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.040
I'll be sure not to make eye contact.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.390
Ma...

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.850
Ma?

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:39.020
Marry me, please!

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.830
No.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.530
Oh, right. The first encounter-proposal incident.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.020
That's just how Tanaka is.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.760
Yeah...

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.470
I'm getting anxious just thinking about tomorrow.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.080
I'm gonna go for a walk.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.500
Is he gonna be okay? He's so devoted that he might turn into a stalker.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.200
Yeah, I don't think he'll go that far.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.090
He's pretty receptive to people's feelings, so if Shimizu told him to stop, he'd probably stop.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.510
Then he'd go off on a journey.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.950
I always think he's an idiot, but in reality, he's actually sort of amazing.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.520
Being so simple and so devoted like that...

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.770
is probably pretty hard.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.440
All right!

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.440
That's a service ace!

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.570
Karasuno Inarizaki Karasuno Inarizaki
Karasuno

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.710
Relief server Yamaguchi Tadashi is living up to his title!

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.400
Inarizaki Karasuno Inarizaki Karasuno

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.680
Whoa, they put one over on us!

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.170
Quiet down, Atsumu!

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.870
Huh?

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.460
I'm so sorry!

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.880
See? Now look what you've done!

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.580
What?

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.210
Do it again!

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.610
Nice receive!

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.970
Ow!

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.400
Couldn't he see he wouldn't get it before he hit the wall?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.810
And it's not like he could return the ball, right?

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.320
I'm pretty sure the only thing on his mind was that the ball hadn't touched the ground yet.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.940
How do I put it?

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.410
He doesn't have the luxury of just giving up.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.370
Damn you.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.920
Damn it!

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.320
That was powerful!

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.090
The ball's heading back to Inarizaki's side!

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.760
We need this chance.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.260
Don't let it slip away!

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.980
Finish it off!

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.010
Got it!

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.650
And that's a wipe!

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.200
Thanks, Kageyama!

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.330
Yep.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.370
You're totally like an ace, Asahi!

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.790
Thanks!

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.670
I mean, he is the ace.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.290
Everyone's totally on their game right now.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.750
Is he allowed to cross over the net like that?

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.510
Well, the ball and the player didn't actually enter Inarizaki's side of the court, so yep.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.070
Where the hell did you go?!

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.890
You missed Tadashi in action!

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:57.880
Were you taking a shit?!

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.740
I was saving my student!

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.320
Also, those stairs suck!

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.720
Man, I hit it toward their number one!

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.600
And after I was told to shoot for their number five with the crew cut.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.610
Don't worry about it.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.620
Karasuno reaches set point first!
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.950
If they miss this chance, the next server is Miya Atsumu.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.080
I'm pretty sure that Karasuno wants to seal the deal with this next point.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.170
We still have a chance.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.630
It's on...

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.960
our side!

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.760
And he's shut down!

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.600
He's stopped in his tracks by the middle blocker, Suna Rintarou!

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.610
Nice block, Rintarou!
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.130
Sorry about that.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.610
It was a bit short.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.610
Nah, I totally thought I could go for it.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.990
If that were me, I'd be so annoyed that I'd either be spiking the ball into the net or out of bounds by now!

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.370
He actually realizes he does that?!

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.920
Please.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.680
Don't let him get a streak going.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.620
Aim your serves at their number five.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.900
He hasn't made any great plays today.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.480
If we're gonna drag them down,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.260
start with him.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.740
It's gonna come at me.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.040
Everyone aiming for me is nothing new.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.710
Come at me!

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.470
Yeah!

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.420
What?!

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.890
Am I just, like,

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.980
extra lame today?

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.090
Nice receive!

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.420
All of you, bring in the blockers, little by little!

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.240
To be honest, I'm not great at this, but...

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.040
And Sawamura scores from the back row!

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.250
Yeah!

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.750
Nice, nice, Daichi! Push it, push it, Daichi! Do it again!
Fly Fly

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.940
Karasuno managed to limit Miya Atsumu to one serve!

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.220
Not bad.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.370
Nice spike, Daichi!

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.050
Thanks!

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.510
Inarizaki Karasuno Karasuno is at set point yet again!

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.480
Nice!

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:01.150
They're using that fast attack they're not used to yet when their opponents are at set point?

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.080
That's great. Keep it up!

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.540
We can score here!

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.710
He's fast!

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.090
The time it takes them to get their blocks in place is decreasing.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.110
Damn it!

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.490
This ain't enough to break Ryuu!

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.260
Yes, ma'am!

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.810
A C quick.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:29.650
We're gonna stop it!

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.610
I put too much into that one.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.570
Dammit.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.320
What have I even done today?

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.100
Left!

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.030
Tanaka!

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.500
What did I even do?

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.290
Three blockers!

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.100
You're overreacting... or maybe not.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:16.080
Inarizaki's blocking is persistent, and Karasuno is extremely eager to score.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.820
If the added stress of being targeted causes even a single mistake...

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.790
It makes you feel like everything is going wrong.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:45.020
Haikyuu!!

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:38.010


00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.050
I'm Tanaka Ryuunosuke from Oujitsu Junior High!

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:53.810
Nice to meet ya!

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.870
So blond.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.410
Yeah, I definitely feel like he's got a strong will and won't be bowing down to anyone.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.530
Karasuno hasn't been performing that well lately, but in my heart, it's a powerhouse.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.850
Kurokawa from Hisa Junior High,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.110
Azumane from Seikoudai...

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.810
I've heard this school's got some awesome spikers I've seen in tournaments before.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.910
And that Nishinoya's in my class too.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.050
But man...

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.900
Reality is so dull.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.060
Other people need to use the gym today, so we're gonna be outside.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.310
Right!

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.050
Wait, again?!

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.920
Why don't we complain?

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.660
Hey, this is way better than last year.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.900
And there's plenty we can do outside.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.210
What a bunch of pushovers.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.450
Karasuno                      Ougi West

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.780
Thank you very much!

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.450
Thanks!

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.370
There weren't as tough as I thought they'd be.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.940
You couldn't even call that practice.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.290
Talk about a disappointment.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.870
I'll go shut their mouths.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:58.790
How, exactly?

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.730
Oh, it's easy.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.630
I'm just gonna go thwack 'em ever so slightly when no one's looking.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.060
Let it go.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.260
It's great that they're playing us at all.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.430
Not to mention, today was the first day with our new team, so we were a mess.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.960
You're just gonna let them say that about us?!

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.270
Aren't you being a pushover?

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.390
We just have to win instead.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.210
I'm not saying it'll be easy, but it's that simple.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.760
Better get used to it.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.260
You'll be hearing it a lot.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.400
There are a lot of guys whispering about us at official matches.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.080
There sure are.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.400
"The fallen champs," "the clipped crows."

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.740
The look in their eyes doesn't match their laughter.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.890
Up until now, I treated all my upperclassmen like adults, even if they were just a year older than me.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.990
But these guys are a bit different.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.020
This is, uh...

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.050
These guys are good.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.360
Let's go to the spring tournament!

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.360
Wait, what the heck did you do?!

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.530
I, uh, thought I'd reevaluate my determination and stuff.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.510
Hey, let me touch.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.540
Man, that was lucky!

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.340
It sure was.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.990
You owe me some damn pudding.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.840
And not the kind that's sold in three-packs.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.190
Sorry!

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.550
Inarizaki Karasuno And they're tied yet again!

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.520
Can Karasuno High School make it through this?!

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.490
Did they do something super bad?

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.420
That mistake didn't exactly come out of nowhere.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.450
It's more like proof that the pressure from Inarizaki's blocking is piling up,

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.160
which is causing him to mess up.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.680
It's all right!

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.900
That was a good shot!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.670
Right!

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:04.840
Damn it!

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.360
Hey, kid with the crew cut! Do better!

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.170
Now's the time to show your stuff!

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.870
It'll be all right.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.010
It's Tanaka.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.390
He's pretty tough when it comes to matches,

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.690
and out of us second-years,

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.340
the only one who stayed on the team no matter what happened...

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.390
was Tanaka.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.400
Bring it on!

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.660
C'mon.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:36.490
You should be getting quiet or having a hard time looking at your teammates by now.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.830
Got it!

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.410
Their setter touched the ball first.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.550
That only leaves Tanaka on the left in the front row.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.840
He's gonna have a really hard time if he can't make this.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.310
How do you know the ball's going to go up to him?

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.290
That'd just be the standard play, and also, uh...

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:04.230
The wing spiker in the front row is like the last bastion when it comes to offense.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.940
I failed to call for the set!

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.650
I freaked out for a second. Dammit!

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.760
What's lame isn't losing the match.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.580
It's being too scared to try!

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.460
Left!

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.360
Azumane!

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.300
A waterfall ball.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.770
Karasuno is still managing to inch away from Inarizaki's reach!
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.340
Aw, they didn't give the ball to the guy with the crew cut.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.230
Yeah.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.860
Bokuto! Get a hold of yourself!

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.870
Ryuu just keeps getting blocked left and right.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:59.540
And I can't say the guy with glasses was wrong to try to get out of the rut they're stuck in.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.560
But...

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.710
Man, that must've sucked for Ryuu.

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:07.350
Tanaka!

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:09.880
Earlier,

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.370
when their number ten ran up right in the middle, you totally went in for the block with a "wham"!

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:17.760
It was super awesome!

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.880
Especially because you end up by yourself a lot as a middle blocker.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.480
So when someone comes to your aid, it's super reassuring!

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.360
Wow, that idiot said something decent for once.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.020
Y-You think so?

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.000
Yeah!

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.070
It was just like one of Date Tech's blocks! Seriously!

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.850
You can try to stop me,

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.250
but you're just one man.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.880
Awesome block, Shouyou, Ryuu!

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.970
Both that airheaded smooth talker and the guy who'll take compliments are scary.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.980
Nice receive, Daichi!

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.770
The rest of you better put your lives on the line and get that ball over!

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.390
I'm pretty sure I'm a normal human being.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.650
Especially when it comes to my build and abilities.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.830
When I was a kid, I was convinced that I was a prodigy.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.170
I might've thought that until I was in junior high.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.000
Actually, I'm still sorta convinced that I am.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.430
But I'm probably never going to be 180 cm tall.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.870
I'm confident in my athletic skills,

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.970
but right now, I'm not the best at anything on our team.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.560
But that's not enough of a reason to quit, nor is it an excuse.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.470
Actually, I don't usually think about this stuff.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.260
But about once every six months,

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.430
when my mental state just takes a nosedive, I end up thinking,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.790
"I'm nothing but average."

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.650
However,

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.040
to my average self, I ask,

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.110
"Do you really have time to look down like that?"

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.230
Left!

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.270
Damn, that blocker's fast.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.700
It's okay.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.160
As long as I don't give up on trying,

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.330
I'll eventually be able to do it!

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:03.430
Hell yeah!

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.930
Nice spike.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.640
He did it!

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.690
Seriously, what the hell is with him?

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.250
He's so awesome!

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:26.830
Inarizaki Karasuno
The old contenders swoop in to take the first set from the ultimate challengers, Inarizaki!

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.040
Where will the match go from here?!

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.110
Wow. For a moment there, I really didn't know what was going to happen.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.760
Tanaka usually makes it through okay.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.840
True!

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.660
Damn, I am really good or what?!

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.240
You sure are!

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.410
Tsukishima!

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.730
You totally ignored me earlier, didn't you?

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.730
Huh?

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.220
Well, I figured that Azumane had a better chance of scoring the point.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.190
Did you really have to be that blunt about it?!

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:01.950
Well, you and your insane mental fortitude are scary.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.280
Don't you ever get depressed?

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.360
Uh, I was depressed!

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.070
When?

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.620
Just a bit ago! For like a few seconds!

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.660
Well, just think about it.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.560
Which is cooler, a super-depressed me or super hype squad me?

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.020
Uh, neither, to be honest.
Obviously it's the hype squad version of me!

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.340
When you've hit rock bottom, there's nowhere to go but up!

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.330
You make it sound way easier than it is.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.910
Damn, Ryuu's not bad!

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.240
Wait, did he just get lucky there?

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.360
I never liked being called big.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.230
But...

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.250
Kanoka, you're awesome!

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.650
You can block so high!

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.190
But Ryuu always seemed so envious.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.700
And because of that, I was able to genuinely think, "Wow, maybe I am special."

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.180
That it was okay to be proud.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.890
Left!

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.220
Ryuu's always been straightforward and honest.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.610
I think...

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.090
I really did just have my heart broken.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:21.980


00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:28.870
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:35.620
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:52.300
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:58.810
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:04.820
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:10.820
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.530
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:22.380
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:28.380
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:34.140
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:40.310
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990


00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:56.990
Episode Seventeen: Cats. vs Monkeys

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.030
Next time: "Cats vs. Monkeys."
