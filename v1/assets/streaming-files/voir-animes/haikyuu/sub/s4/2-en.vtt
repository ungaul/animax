WEBVTT

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.350
You weren't invited, right?

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.150
Hey! You're Karasuno's number ten!

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.650
You little shit...

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.650
What the hell do you think you're doing, Hinata?!

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.150
Damn it!

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.320
Hinata, being a go-getter and rash are different things.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.210
Don't mistake the two.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.910
It's not that I think practicing here is more important than practicing at Karasuno.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.090
But I want to participate at a training camp that's going to be filled with talented players.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.090
Without that setter, Kageyama,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.920
I can't say that I sense any worth in you.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.300
If you don't want to be a ball boy, you can go home at any time.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.310
Sorry for interrupting practice!

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.520
I'm a first-year from Karasuno High School!

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.520
Hinata Shouyou!

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.730
I'm 164 cm tall!

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.470
And I'm a ball boy!

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.500
Thank you for having me!

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.950


00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.250
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.870
Now, go bask in the orange glow

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.220
!
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !
Haikyuu

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.360
Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.490
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.370
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.370
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:50.080
If a person tries to live their life swallowing their dreams and passions

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.800
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.840
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.770
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.940
Awaits a land Of thrilling competition

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.300
Unleash everything you've got

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.650
Winning or losing doesn't even seem to matter

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.820
When you're in the zone and everything flows

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.440
In glorious slow-motion Now, go all-out!

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.000


00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.050
Episode Two: Lost Episode Two: Lost Episode Two: Lost

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.230
We have one month until the spring tournament.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.470
I want you to use this time to improve on the one and only powerful individual skill in volleyball:

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.180
The serve.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.450
I say this all the time, but don't just do your reps to get them over with.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.140
You have to keep visualizing that you're in an actual match.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.670
Yes, sir!

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.350
All right! Make sure I can hear you, newbies!

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.630
Right!
All right, if you'll excuse me, sir.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.580
Here I go!

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.840
I'm gonna go for a bit.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.730
You're heading to Yamagata, right?
One more!

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.820
Yeah. I need to go see my upperclassman from college.
All right, here we go!

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.330
I'm also gonna pop into Shiratorizawa on the way without imposing.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.400
Give us a good serve!

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.330
Bring it!

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.840
I'll have to save lecturing Hinata for when we get back tomorrow.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.630
I'm having Tattsun come by just in case.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.040
He should be here any minute.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.850
Thank you very much.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.970
By the way, about Coach Ukai possibly showing up...

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.070
Well...

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.190
Gramps hasn't been feeling well lately, so he's back in the hospital.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.580
I see... Oh, no. It's not a big deal.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.290
Well, see ya later.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.560
Thanks.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.060
Usually, you'd be on opposing teams in qualifiers.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.040
But while you're here, you're not opponents.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.800
Just the fact that you're doing something out of the ordinary is important.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.430
Take whatever you can from each other and get even better.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.180
That's all.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.160
Thank you very much!

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.190
Let's see... First, we're going to do passing drills.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.350
We're going to have you remember each other's names.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.800
Hi!

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.010
Make sure you pair with someone that's not completely equal with you.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.780
Come on! Get a move on!

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.780
Wow, he really is the odd man out.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.140
Even though he's a starter...

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.410
Um...

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.660
We heard you're from Karasuno and helping as ball boy.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.900
Yes!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.880
It's Karasuno's number ten...

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.360
Um, we're first-years from Shiratorizawa.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.460
We're supposed to be helping out too, so it's nice to work with you.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.680
Right back at you!

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.820
Man, two meters really is huge.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.280
I wonder how everything looks when you're two meters tall.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.400
The guy started volleyball in high school, yet he's been chosen to be here.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.400
He gets to start from a completely different place than us.
Your arms aren't facing the right way.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.160
Turn you arms so the inside is showing more.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.570
All right, next. Spiking drills!

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.250
Hey.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.510
That's not where you pick up the balls.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.190
Sorry! I went the wrong way!

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.420
Just place the ball... Just place the ball...

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.730
Nice set!

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.300
How was my set?

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.900
It was fine.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.490
Tell me more!

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.130
Koganegawa from Date Tech.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.250
His technical skills are lacking, but he seems to be getting taller.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.920
Nice set!

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.780
Very nice. A giant setter.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.920
Nice spike!

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.880
Yes.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.400
Nice spike!

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.130
Was that a bit too high?

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.760
Yeah, a little.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.310
I'll correct it.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.970
A third-year from Shiratorizawa Junior High, Yura Shouta.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.000
Nice spike!

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.950
Thanks!

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.440
I see he has no problem communicating with the older players.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.060
Nice spike!
And the technique is there.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.730
Nice spike!

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.400
C-Crap!

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.150
Safe!

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.500
Be more careful!

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.040
Pick up those damn balls!

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.620
Yes, sir!

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.780
Keep your eyes on them!

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.370
Yes, sir!

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.010
He's getting yelled at more than us.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.710
I wonder why Coach Washijou didn't just send that kid packing.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.340
If he's not going to practice, he should just force him to go home.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.440
He's usually not interested in small players, right?

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.340
Supposedly.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.320
What a waste.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.610
I'd totally nurture him as a wing spiker.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.790
Well, Karasuno did manage to take their spot at the spring tournament this year.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.810
Maybe he's getting back at them.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.950
Like he'd ever do something so immature.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.280
Nice spike!

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.750
Man, I'm starving...

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.590
Let's go home.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.910
Yeah.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.720
That little shrimp...

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.190
He's not the same newbie he was in junior high.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.350
He must've put in a lot of work.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.040
Damn it.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.410
I guess jump serves are pretty hard.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.540
Come to think of it, this is the first time I've ever just been the ball boy.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.250
Even when I played with the older ladies or in junior high, they'd still let me practice.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.800
What have you been doing for the last three years?!

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.130
I'll defeat you next time.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.590
I'm going on ahead.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.850
I can't...

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.400
stop!

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.590
Hey.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.550
Could you hurry up and get ready to leave?

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.680
Unlike the King's camp, this isn't an excused absence.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.140
We have to go to school tomorrow like normal.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:07.870
Tsukishima.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.490
I... I...

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.940
I-I'm sorry for the—

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.430
Yeah, could you not apologize?

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.700
It's not like being an impulsive dumbass is anything new for you.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.490
You mad that you can't even really touch the ball?

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.260
Serves you right.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.960
Wanna cry, saying you're gonna quit?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.560
Keep doing your best, ball boy.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.710
Make sure you don't waste a precious five days of practice before the spring tournament.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.880
Faculty Room

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:39.460
Man, that Hinata kid from Karasuno was messing around with the ball until the very end.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.580
Though I was still surprised when he crashed the training camp.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.100
I don't mind youngins who are a bit reckless.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.100
But...

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.990
even if he shows an excessive amount of effort or determination during this camp,

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.340
I have no intention of letting him join the practice.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.160
Hey!

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.120
Gimme back this week's Jump!

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.100
I'm still reading "Removes Unnecessary Hair and Leaves Skin Feeling Silky Smooth."

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.090
Could you read the actual manga instead of the adverts?

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.090
By the way, you're gonna go to the first-years' training camp tomorrow, right,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.000
Wakatoshi?

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.530
Yeah.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:38.030
Haikyuu!!

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.020


00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.450
Camp (back the same day)
All-Japan Youth All-Japan Youth So?

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.320
Did you really think they'd let you join the practice if you went?

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.340
Keep quiet Keep quiet

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.810
Everyone's so far ahead of me, so I wanted to do something to catch up.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.800
I mean, he's not wrong.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.660
And yet...

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.480
That doesn't make it okay for you to cause everyone trouble.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.320
Right.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:25.700
So you're saying that Coach Washijou doesn't care if Hinata's here or not?

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.150
Well, uh... actually, yeah.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:34.210
So you volunteered to be a ball boy?

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.310
Yessir.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.640
You stuck your nose in all this.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.950
You'd better not regret this.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.100
Think about what it is that only you can do there.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.600
Also, don't go underestimating what it takes to be a ball boy.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.780

That's all.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.250
Is there anything you'd like to say?

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.150
No, sir.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.710
Faculty Office Please excuse me.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.610
One lecture after another for you, huh?

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.350
When'd Daichi get to you?

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.030
First thing this morning.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.780
How many times do I have to tell you?!

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.000
You always need to consider how your actions will affect others!

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.600
Good going, Hinata!

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.400
Suga!

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.540
Whoops, my bad.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.710
Well, I mean, you are pretty bad.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.800
Make sure you learn a special attack or something.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.800
You don't often get the opportunity to play with guys from other teams.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.270
Don't panic too much.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:16.700
I'm sorry.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.940
Shouyou!

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.650
How's the training camp going?

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.210
Th-The guy who's two meters tall is super huge!

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.410
So that one guy's there too? Uh... Manzawa!

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.160
You mean Hyakuzawa!

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:42.380
One, two, three, four... Five, six, seven, eight...

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.380
Shouyou, could you make the drinks again?
Two, two, three, four... Five, six, seven... Got it.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.590
Today, we'll be doing serve and spike drills.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.150
After that, we'll have a practice match.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.310
Right!

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.440
Hey! Wake up!

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.650
Sorry!

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.160
A perfect straight spike...

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.880
Nice spike.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.810
Tsutomu!
Yes, sir.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.390
The way your body's facing.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:14.980
Yes, sir.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.580
You're completely obvious.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.250
Nice spike!

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.420
Come at me, Hyakuzawa!

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.030
What the heck was that?

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.190
It was so cool!

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.590
Do another one of those perfect straight spikes!

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.450
All right, next, form up for a match!

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.640
Yessir!

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.840
Shouyou, get the vests!

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.670
Oh, right!

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.820
Nagamatsu!

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.940
Nice receive!

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.540
Left!

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.440
Two blockers!

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.830
Apparently that Nagamatsu guy's a third-year in junior high.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.500
He's gonna be coming to our school, right?

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.300
Man, I can't believe he's younger than us.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.180
Heya.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.090
Looks like they're here.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.430
Hello!

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:21.350
Ugh...

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.820
So we're really lucky.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:37.560
Some third-years and alumni from Shiratorizawa agreed to play a practice match with you boys.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.030
Bleh.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.560
Seriously?

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.700
It's Ushijima!

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.780
You acting like a hotshot, Tsutomu?

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.500
Ushiwaka... It's actually him.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.500
No, I'm not!

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.970
A practice match...

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.190
with Ushiwaka!

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.790
First, decide on who's going to play and the signs you'll use.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.710
Talk amongst yourselves.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.600
I spot number ten from Karasuno!

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.610
I'm gonna cut you down to size even more!

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:08.680
I'm—

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.690
Hey!

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.520
Could you make me more drinks?

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.280
Right!
Sorry!

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.800
Let's play!

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.730
Blockers!

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.390
You put your hands down way too early!

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.240
Don't give up the block that easily!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.850
Yes, sir.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.690
And you need to stop crouching too low before you block.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.150
That's why you're always late.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.570
Yes, sir!

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.410
Someone could've dug that out!

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.240
I need to hear your voices more! Talk to each other!

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.580
Wakatoshi!

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.750
So heavy... Koganegawa! A serve's coming!

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.850
Hey!

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.330
Right!

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.820
Just because we're at the net, it doesn't mean we have to slam the ball down.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.640
Right.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.710
Time for a lap of diving drills!

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:30.610
Right!

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.140
So...

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.990
why aren't ya playing?

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.060
B-Because...

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.960
I wasn't actually chosen to be here.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.910
Huh?

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.710
Then why the heck are you here?

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.510
I-I crashed their practice.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.460
Did you hear that, Wakatoshi?!

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.330
This kid's totally crazy!

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.310
So...

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.850
what are you even doing?

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.080
Come on, let's go mop the court.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.280
Right!

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.650
I'll go get it!

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.050
Rolling... Thunder...

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.500
Double!

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.520
Tanaka just got run over by Nishinoya!

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.920
Nishinoya! Tanaka!

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.890
Wait, why am I getting yelled at?!

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.940
Why aren't they actually resting during break time?

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.440
The hell are you two doing?!

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.470
My bad!

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.260
Noya ran into me!

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.570
Yeah... Take this more seriously!

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.090
Hey.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.630
We'll be doing serves next.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.310
Yessir!

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.740
Bring it!

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.310
Hit a good one!

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.220
It's out!

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.270
Don't worry about it, Asahi!

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.230
Here I go!

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.510
Give us a good one!

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.630
You got this!

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.610
It's going out!

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.750
Ukai.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.410
What's the matter?

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.080
Here I go!

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.030
Nice receive!

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:17.550
In order to win the upcoming tournament, we can't lose any of our current players.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.720
That obviously includes Hinata.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.000
But because of that, we've limited what Hinata should be doing.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.930
All for what's best for the team.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:36.400
In a way, we're doing the same thing as Coach Washijou and going with the most effective method.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.570
But that's also why we have weapons that've been polished to be their best.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.810
One more!

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:50.240
Not to mention, Hinata understands more than anyone else that he's got a ton of stuff to work on.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.480
Okay, here I go!

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.950
Here I go!

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.580
One more!

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.020
So I'm sure that makes him panic a bit.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.540
One more!

00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:00.130
If we can always present the correct answer to them, we should.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.510
But the best thing we can do is make sure that they don't stop thinking,

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.920
and to make sure they keep searching for what's best for them. Don't you agree?

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:12.980
Not to mention,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.870
we're not the only ones thinking here.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.460
I think we can win the next one!

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.770
Pretty sure you're imagining it.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.940
But our blocks are finally starting to work.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.950
Now that our blocks are coming together, it makes things in the back easier.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.910
I need to have my team's blockers learn from this.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.510
So,

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.720
what...

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.260
the heck am I doing?!

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.540
What have you been doing for the last three years?!

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.920
Make sure you don't waste a precious five days of practice before the spring tournament.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.500
Don't panic too much.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.000
I can't say that I sense any worth in you.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.190
Just the fact that you're doing something out of the ordinary is important.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.510
So what chance do you have if your technique is clumsy too?

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.550
To become good at something, you must follow the proper steps.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.230
You can go home at any time.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.560
Also, don't go underestimating what it takes to be a ball boy.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:42.030
So... what are you even doing?

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.360
Find it!

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.160
Find it!

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.460
Think!

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.820
I need to change my perspective!

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.870
I need to change the way I think!

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.310
Think about what it is that only you can do there.
Think about what it is that only I can do here.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.850
Find it.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.070


00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.090
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.320
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.390
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:56.480
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.880
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.210
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:07.570
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.410
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.660
Turned them into conviction

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:20.130
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.760
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.610
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:34.930
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:40.520
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.230
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:50.680
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:52.030


00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:57.030
Episode Three: Point of View

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.570
Next time: "Point of View."
