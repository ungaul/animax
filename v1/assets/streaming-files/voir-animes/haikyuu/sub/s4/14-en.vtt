WEBVTT

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.380
We don't need the memories

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.240
Could the one to keep our eye on this match be the one people are calling the top high school setter,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.910
Inarizaki's Miya Atsumu?

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.620
Indeed, we should.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.410
Tsubakihara (Kanagawa)
Karasuno (Miyagi)
Inarizaki (Hyougo)

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.410
But we should also keep our eyes on Karasuno's setter.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.330
Karasuno High School's Kageyama Tobio.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.420
He's another skilled player who was invited to the All-Japan Youth Camp this year.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.670
We're definitely seeing a setter battle between East and West!

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.550
That jump was really good!

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.020
I forgot to hit the ball!

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.570
How could I waste an opportunity like that?!

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.450
No need to be so depressed.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.700
Isn't that the first time Hinata's been distracted by anything other than a set that went up?

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.250
If you ever do that again during a match, I'm never setting to you again.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.670
You need to make sure you can do both.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.670
You absolutely suck!

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.880
Got it!

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.020
Did something click with him...

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.350
after he saw the real deal yesterday?

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.610
Maybe.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.150
But even if he's able to make that boom jump a success,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.320
I didn't expect Hinata's highest point of contact to change that drastically.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.530
This is going to throw us off.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.960


00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.230
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.110
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.490
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.790
If we give up now It'll all be over

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.250
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.800
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.470
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.390
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.060
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.570
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.240
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.160
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.670
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.920
So we're smiling for now 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.640
Episode Fourteen: Rhythm Episode Fourteen: Rhythm

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.880
Episode Fourteen: Rhythm Give us a good serve!

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.850
I couldn't care less if it's loud or quiet.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.730
What a tough spot to reach!

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.060
And the receive is a bit sloppy.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.150
Got it! Tanaka!
Tanaka goes in for finish!

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.360
I touched it!

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.150
You got this!

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.400
Mine.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.620
Miya Atsumu sets the ball on the first touch!

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.880
Then Ojiro Aran smashes it over the net!

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.510
Karasuno High School has completely stopped in their tracks!

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.010
Aran Nice spike, Aran!

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.430
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories
Nice spike, Aran! Jump, jump, Aran!

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.100
Do it again!
Nice spike!

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.060
You scared the crap outta me!

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.650
Inarizaki's always breaking the mold.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.230
"The ultimate challengers," huh?

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.400
Aran's not bad, though I'm better!

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.700
Right, Akaashi?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.410
Yes.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.450
Of course that was a very direct surprise attack,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.660
but they were also trying to say,

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.620
"We're not going to be overwhelmed by our first match. This is a piece of cake,"

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.920
and put pressure on them.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.960
I can keep calm while watching them play,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.050
but it'd suck playing against them.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.510
They piss me off.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.270
Give us a good serve!

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.690
Right at the whistle?!

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.400
Sorry! That was a bit long!

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.610
He managed a rebound without turning around!

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.450
That was good!

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.160
There!

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.120
We're up against the ultimate challengers.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.450
But...

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.670
we're just as much...

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.510
the challengers when it comes to volleyball!

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.850
Hinata Shouyou ran out and scored the point!

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.860
That's the Karasuno first-year duo's famous broad jump!

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.730
All right!

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.150
Yes!

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.360
Huh?!

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.950
Way to go, Hinata!

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.040
That's a scary attack.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.370
Their first one is always a killer.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.040
Man, I almost ran into that guy with the scary face.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.920
I almost fell for Hinata's fake attack too.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.260
Wow.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.590
Inarizaki Karasuno What the heck was that crazy spike?!

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.380
It sure was crazy!

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.840
That's called a broad jump.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.510
You don't see that much in boys' volleyball.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.640
Yeah?

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.390
It's fast enough to break through a block,

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.060
yet it doesn't sacrifice any height.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.520
How frickin' cool is that?!

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.990
That thing's even cooler to see in person!

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.110
What's your deal? You always mentally regress, like, five years when we're in a match.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.490
Shut yer trap!

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.950
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.880
It doesn't really seem like we're applying pressure to them.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.630
That four-eyes earlier was basically smirkin' the whole time.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.840
I mean, you can try to distract me when I'm serving all you want, but it won't work.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.890
Should we switch things up early?

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.810
Yeah, let's.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.850
The whole team that placed second at the interhigh is giving it their all to beat us!

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.980
When it's my turn to serve...

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.490
it'll be hundreds of them versus me!

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.880
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.590
They're going faster and faster.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.270
That serve toss wasn't the best.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.240
His first step was perfect!

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.660
They're going into a fast attack from there?!

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.080
Nice spike, Ren! Jump, jump, Ren!
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.420
Do it again!
Holy crap!

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.290
You only need to see it once.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.550
His first step was as refined as it gets.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:55.010
That quick and accurate first step gives the setter time to set up and figure out where his teammates are,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.680
and it gives the team time to figure things out.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.890
When a middle blocker scores the point, the opposing middle blocker scores right back.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.060
Nice. Neither side is letting up.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.160
Are they gonna use every last bit of the eight seconds they have?!

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.130
Nishinoya!

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.750
I was a half-step late!

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.420
Hell yeah!

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.550
Nice, nice, Ryuu! Push it, push it, Ryuu!

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.140
Cut them right off, Ina High!

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.850
Hey, Ryuu's not half bad.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.310
Yeah.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.610
Number ten's decoy was effective too,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.820
but he's got a good eye on the blockers and the floor.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.950
He used to just smash the ball as hard as he could.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.820
S-Sure.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.080
She's staring way harder than I expected.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:19.390
It's like that thing where people start syncing up their applause for, like, a long jump in track and field.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.850
But it's way different when you start it yourself than when people just randomly start it for you.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.270
Even if the crowd means well, it may just end up provoking Karasuno.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:35.990
It's fine!

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.110
That's not good.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.490
Huh?

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.700
That rhythm that keeps getting faster.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:47.750
That pressure isn't obvious, but before you know it, they're setting the rhythm.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:53.710
I thought we'd just have to worry about the booing, but this is becoming an impediment too.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:59.090
We have to start by being on par with our serves, or we're not gonna get anywhere.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.400
Yeah!

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.360
Nice serve, Aran!
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:20.570
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.780
Inarizaki High School's managed their second service ace already this match.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.570
The lead just keeps growing!

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.840
Inarizaki doesn't seem like they're established champions.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.130
They still have the feel of a team of upstarts that are climbing their way up.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.840
Then they've got their support...

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.720
Inarizaki's cheering section seems more like cover fire than just your usual support.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.770
I see what you mean.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.770
Both on and off the court,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.980
Inarizaki uses sound and time

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.980
to expand their territory.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.700
Dang, their team's cheer squad is hella impressive!

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.170
Sorry to keep you boys waiting!

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:30.930
Haikyuu!!

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.930


00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.190
Nice serve, Aran!

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.400
Inarizaki High School's managed their second service ace already this match.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.360
Inarizaki Karasuno The lead just keeps growing!

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.530
What the heck? Inarizaki's already taken over the gym.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.240
Atsumu, your first serve was a bit off.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.330
Did you let the cheer squad distract you?

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.800
If only you guys had beaten Nekoma, you'd be playing here too, Suguru.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:07.050
Nohebi Academy Volleyball Team Former Captain Daishou Suguru

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.930
Y-Yeah, you're right, Mika.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.650
Wow, they're so cool!

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.730
Talk about pressure.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.520
Glad I'm not playing against them.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.080
Hey, taiko drums.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.290
That's awesome!

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.210
Fly Fly

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.170
It's Saeko!

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.300
Her awesomeness is lethal.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.140
That's definitely a new way to die.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.890
Thank goodness they made it in time.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:51.600
Yeah.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.020
You're late!

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.560
My bad! We sorta got lost!

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.320
I just figured you were drinking all night again.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.610
I mean, I was drinking until 5 AM, but we still left on time.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.070
Give us a good serve!

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.080
Yes!
Thanks!

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.460
Wow! He's so fast!

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.380
Nationals is scary!

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.340
You got this, Hinata!

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.550
It's always ideal to have it be silent when you're about to serve,

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.520
but I really want to stop them from taking over the rhythm!

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.230
It doesn't have to be loud enough to overpower them.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.940
As long as we can get a rhythm besides what Inarizaki is playing into the server's ears, then that's enough.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.360
Let's go!

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:55.580
That one time really pissed me off.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.460
But our job here isn't to beat the opponent's cheer squad.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.130
We might not even be able to give our boys the push they need.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.680
Because they're gonna keep moving forward on their own.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:17.060
So we just need to regain the balance in here a bit.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.030
I suddenly feel like I can hit the best serve ever!

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:34.320
Despite all of Inarizaki's provocation, Karasuno's number ten isn't showing even a bit of panic.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.870
It almost looks like he's cracking a bit of a smile.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.040
What kind of serve is he gonna do?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.620
A spike serve? A jump float serve?

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.380
Or a completely normal one.
Aran!

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:47.840
Got it!

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.340
A double quick.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.260
A super fast one from the side.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.010
Tsukishima's blocking the cross.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.740
It hasn't touched the ground.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.030
It hit his foot.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:15.450
The hell?!

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.080
Is that even allowed?

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.080
Technically, yeah.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:19.950
It's just...

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.910
super embarrassing, I'm guessing.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.500
It's that guy again!

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.960
Use your damn hands!

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.960
I totally missed!

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.630
Great job getting to the ball, Shouyou!

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.550
I've gotta regain my dignity!

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.470
Back row minus tempo!

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:43.730
Daichi!

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.400
Fly Fly
Nice, nice, Daichi! Push it, push it, Daichi! Do it again!

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.440
Sawamura moves in from the right!

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.280
Nice set!

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.860
I totally yelled "Back row minus tempo" in my head!

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.870
I honestly thought the set was going to Hinata Shouyou again!

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.960
Maybe Inarizaki is watching Hinata a little too closely.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.880
I can't say I blame them, though.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.250
Inarizaki Karasuno
Looks like Karasuno's getting back into a rhythm!

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.470
I thought he was totally going for Hinata, but he stopped.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.430
He was trying to lure me in.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.970
It totally looked like he was setting to Hinata just now, didn't it?!

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.890
Yes, it did.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:28.560
Simple decoys won't work on read blockers.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.440
But the receive went up in the center of the court,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.570
and it looked like he was setting to Hinata, but it went further right.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.120
It's not just that Kageyama's got everything in his field of view;

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.120
he probably knows how his opponents are viewing him.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.870
Also...

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.870
Hinata's so tiny, but he sure makes himself known on the court!

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.090
Indeed.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.880
Man, that totally looked like it was for me.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880
You moron!

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.050
Kageyama, you moron!

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.510
Not only did they place second in the interhigh,

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.930
they also have that overpowering cheer squad.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.980
But it's possible we've been overestimating them to our detriment.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.690
It'll be okay.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.530
If we approach each problem one at a time, we'll be able to figure this out.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.070
Yes.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:21.370
Nice spike, Hitoshi! Jump, jump, Hitoshi!

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.410
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.370
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.330
Do it again!

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.790
And there's the dual wielder again.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.920
What's that mean?

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.540
Is he gonna use two balls?

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.210
No!

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.590
He can hit a spike serve or a jump float serve.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:40.050
Basically, they won't know if they're gonna get Azumane's serve, Kageyama's serve,

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.680
or Tadashi's serve right up until he actually hits it.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.220
Crap!

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:48.100
And depending on which one it is, the positioning for receiving will be different.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:54.690
If they're even a step off, that delay can prove fatal when the serve comes in at over 100 km/h.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.780
Jaybird Inn

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.780
Miya Atsumu is a dual wielder when it comes to serving.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.990
Does that mean we won't know which serve is coming until he actually tosses the ball up?

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.000
No, you can tell them apart.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.870
Count his steps.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.670
When he's serving, he routinely measures his distance by the number of footsteps.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.340
When he's going for a jump floater, he's four steps from the end line.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.090
When he's going to do a spike serve, it'll be six steps.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.640
That's how you'll be able to tell them apart.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.430
It'll make a huge difference if we can tell which one he's going for.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:31.400
They don't really show all the movements that go into doing a serve on TV, do they?

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.270
I'm surprised you were able to figure that out!

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.270
I did a lot of research!

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:39.400
I looked at videos online and videos my buddies took too.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.410
Thanks!

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.460
That's four... A jump floater.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.380
Bring it!

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.170
You may've figured that out,

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.470
but it's merely the starting line.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.020
It only took a second...

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.810
...and it was right in his face!

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.860
Yet another service ace!

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.780
Miya Atsumu has two incredibly powerful serves under his belt!

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.000
That was an excellent serve!

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.540
Powerful serves can make the team powerful too.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.300
If they don't stop him soon, Karasuno High School is going to be in trouble.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.210
Inarizaki Karasuno Damn, that serve was insane!

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.800
Wow.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.260
All right, guys.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.680
We've dealt with intense serves in the past too.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.560
Now's not the time to panic.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.310
Right!

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.310
Oh?

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.440
Say, Samu.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.320
Yeah, Tsumu?

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.740
We can't miss a chance to score. Am I right?

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.120
Four steps.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.580
Another jump floater?

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.130
Yes!

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.800
Asahi!

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.470
Got it!

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.390
This position.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.100
This timing.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.320
This angle!

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.240
It's all perfect!

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.710
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories
Nice spike, Osamu!

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.880
The ball really did just show up.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.430
Hell yeah!

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:15.020
Th-That was almost like Hinata and Kageyama's...

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.230
deviant fast attack!

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:21.940


00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:28.740
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:35.500
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:52.180
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:58.690
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:04.690
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:10.700
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.410
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:22.250
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:28.260
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:34.010
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:40.190
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.950
