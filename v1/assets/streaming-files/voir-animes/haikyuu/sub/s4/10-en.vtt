00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.520
You got this!

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.400
Out!

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.640
You can do this!

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.090
Everyone was antsy during the opening ceremonies,
One more!

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.340
but they don't seem as nervous as they were during yesterday's practice.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.220
Okay. Okay, got it.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.290
Thanks.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.850
What's the matter?

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.640
One more!

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.310
That was from Shimada at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.010
Apparently, the matches are moving much faster than expected.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.400
Especially in the beginning, it's really important that we warm up properly.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.860
You got this!

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.450
I was hoping we'd have some more time to do it.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.250
Do it again!

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.700
It's about ten minutes to the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium by bus.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.310
All right, let's get going.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.380
Yes, sir.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.570
All right!

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.210
Mommy, I have to go pee.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.810
Hurry up and go.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.190
When's the next bus?

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.840
There, there... You must be hungry.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.330
In four minutes.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.330
Gonna hit the can.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.200
Me too.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.010
I'll watch your stuff.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.320
Thanks!

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.050
You're setting yourself up to be late.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.750
Hey, stop that!

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.220
You first-years have a lot of stuff.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.140
I'll carry some of it.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.930
No, no. It's okay.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.820
These nerves are going to kill me if I don't keep busy with something.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.890
Thanks.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.650
All right, stay calm.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.990
Talking to yourself, Daichi?

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.110
Shut up.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.800
Azumane, you forgot your pass.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.660
Huh? Oh, sorry!

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.310
You won't be able to go inside without this.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.370
Everyone's still stiff as can be, but that's to be expected.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.760
Also, I need to calm down.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.090
Huh?

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.820
What? You forget something?

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.600
No, it's not that. This bag...

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.790
It looks the same as mine, but it's different.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.850
Huh?

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.220
I don't have my shoes!

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.980


00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:21.280
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.900
Now, go bask in the orange glow

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.250
!
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !
Haikyuu

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.390
Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.520
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.390
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.400
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:04.120
If a person tries to live their life without getting a taste of their dreams and passions

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.830
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.870
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.800
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.970
Awaits a land Of thrilling competition

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.330
Unleash everything you've got

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.680
Winning or losing doesn't even seem to matter

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.860
When you're in the zone and everything flows

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.470
In glorious slow-motion Now, go all-out!

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:42.990


00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.290
Episode Ten: Battle Lines Episode Ten: Battle Lines
Episode Ten: Battle Lines

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.100
So it got switched out somewhere?

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.290
It's the orange-colored one from that kids' clothing store, right?

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.770
It was Natsu's, but it's sturdy and was the perfect size...

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.440
While you were in the bathroom,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.890
I looked away from your stuff for just a second.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.100
That must've been when...

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.960
I'm so sorry!

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.000
It's not your fault, Yamaguchi!

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.600
Okay, calm down.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.320
I'll call the gym where we were doing our warmups.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.390
Should we go buy another pair?

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.180
If it comes down to it.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.780
Sorry!

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.200
Don't worry. It's not like anyone's dying.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.490
Hey, where's your phone?

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.210
It's inside that bag!

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.070
Nice idea, Kageyama.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.020
Hello?

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.000
Apparently no one's turned in a bag.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.010
A kid accidentally took it.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.020
His mom said they'd wait at the gym.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.570
Thank goodness.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.990
It's not far.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.230
But Shimada went to pick up the neighborhood crew.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.110
I'll go.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.470
Huh?

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.240
In that case, I should probably go.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.540
I'm pretty confident when it comes to stamina and speed.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.840
I won't take too long,

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.050
but I know you'll feel a little lost without me.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.140
You'll just have to get used to that, however.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.130
Right.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.720
I'll be back before the match starts.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.540
We're sorry!

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.850
This might be asking too much, but try not to worry while I'm gone, okay?

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.810
Thanks, Shimizu. We're counting on you.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.970
Kiyoko, please be safe.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.350
Hearing you talk like that is making me even more nervous, so just stop.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.910
Shimizu will be just fine.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.830
Come on! We need to concentrate on our match!

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.720
Let's get down there and warm up.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.170
Right!

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.580
After practicing, and practicing, and practicing,

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.470
everything I'd worked so hard for ended so abruptly.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.350
What did I do differently that time?

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.460
I could feel my leg cutting through the air, but it was suddenly met with something hard,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.040
and I felt my chest tighten.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.280
Don't give up!

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.820
One more lap!

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.520
Did you already decide on a club, Shimizu?

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.740
Any interest in becoming a manager for the volleyball team?

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.810
It could be that I feared that truth more than I was willing to admit.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.500
Sure.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.590
The volleyball team hadn't had a manager for a while,

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.080
so I picked up some things on my own.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.350
The rules of the game, the referees' hand signals, how points were scored.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.800
It felt nice to devote myself to something,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.850
but it still sort of felt like I was on the outside.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.360
I felt some relief, knowing that I wouldn't be out on the front lines.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:57.090
But as time went on, gradually, the players stopped being just random people to me.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.580
Fly Fly Listen up.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.590
Compared to the floors we usually play on, the floors here will be harder to slide on.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.820
You'll get hurt if you play like you usually do.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.760
Work up a good sweat to get rid of some of that friction.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.040
Yes, sir!

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.390
Umakita Thank you very much!

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.430
All right, let's go!

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.330
Yeah!

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.720
That ceiling's probably gonna cause more of a problem than I expected.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.650
Huh?

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.200
Not only is this our first time here, but it's huge.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.130
We need to expect that it's going to take them a little while to get used to the sense of distance.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.840
Make sure you get the ball higher than usual!

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.580
Yessir!

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.700
So bright—

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.840
Come on! Be more careful!

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.800
Right!

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.950
Man, my hands take forever to warm up when I'm nervous.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.440
Do you need some gloves?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.940
Nah, I'll be fine.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.000
Don't you ever get nervous?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.950
I do.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.920
But I'm not nervous right now.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.320
The hell?

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.330
This is just another step toward our goal.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.930
Damn you, you big shot!

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.920
Hurry up and come back to me, shoes!

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.380
I became a volleyball team manager on a whim.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.560
There wasn't anyone filling that position before me,

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.120
so I thought they'd just go back to how things were if I ever left.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.240
But...

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.430
I had to pass it on.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.990
I had to entrust this position to someone new.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.030
After practicing, and practicing, and practicing,

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:15.090
everything I'd worked so hard for ended so abruptly.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.820
So what?

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.200
It's not that I'm admitting defeat.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.520
It's not that I'm saying we're going to win.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.860
I'm not going to be standing on the court,

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.810
nor am I going to be wearing a uniform.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.800
But right now...

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.460
I have to take on this challenge!

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.080
This is my battle line right now.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.450
Hitoka!

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.900
My shoes!

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.160
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.450
I'm pretty sure I can jump about five meters high now!

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.080
Really? I'll be looking forward to that, then.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.470
All right, line up—

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.840
Let's go, Tsuba Academy!

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.530
Yeah!

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:42.380
My nerves... are about to kill me... so let's at least make sure we're being heard out there!

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.590
Stop making it sound like all we know how to do is yell.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:12:00.030
Haikyuu!!

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.020


00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:05.950
Karasuno Tsubakihara Miyagi Miyagi Karasuno Karasuno

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.120
The match between Karasuno High School

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.100
and Tsubakihara Academy is about to begin!

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.370
Let's have a good match!

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.740
To be honest, I was a bit worried with how nervous everyone was,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.960
but they seem to be over it now.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.190
Especially Hinata.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.310
Maybe him losing his shoes was a blessing in disguise.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.930
And it's all thanks to Shimizu.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.640
Yeah!

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.060
You okay, Maruyama?

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.820
You look like you're the most nervous.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.800
I'm okay!

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.120
I'm never going to repeat the nightmare where we were on the bus back home before I knew what happened!

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.200
You were insanely nervous for our first nationals last year.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.180
All right, I want you to concentrate on splitting up their attacks with your serves.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.040
We'll be able to deal with them as long as we can limit their attacks.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.170
But don't take your eyes off of their number ten.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.600
He'll hit the ball from the direction we're least expecting.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.000
Yes, sir!

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.090
They're totally staring at us.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.600
Those guys beat Shiratorizawa, right?

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.190
Let's not think about that.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.250
Would you have preferred to play Shiratorizawa?

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.240
Nope!

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.060
Right?

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:23.320
We saw their match against Shiratorizawa at their qualifiers, and it's not like they crushed them.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.030
Lucky breaks happen to exist in this world.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.910
So basically, we're lucky that we're not going up against Ushiwaka!

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.250
Correct.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.110
You sure are good at looking on the bright side.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.920
It doesn't change the fact that they beat Shiratorizawa.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.930
But that doesn't matter.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.280
Maru's not the only one who doesn't want a repeat of last year.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.730
Every team here has defeated another powerhouse school to qualify.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:04.250
And those powerhouses that defeated other powerhouses may still disappear instantly.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.820
In this first match,

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:10.840
the team that's overwhelmed up by their opponents and the crowd will disappear.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.500
Hit 'em with a killer serve!

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.700
It's out!

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.340
Nice call!

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.660
Sorry.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.800
It's okay. Just focus on the next point.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.010
Lucky, lucky, Tsuba High! Lucky, lucky, Tsuba High!
Even the Smallest Stream Can Become a Great River

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.470
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:41.820
Sorry!
Someone get it!

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:48.060
He served right into the spot where the back-row setter would cross paths with someone else.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.370
He hit to that spot like it's nothing.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:52.660
Daichi!

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.910
Nice receive.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.880
The one we have to definitely look out for is their number four, Teradomari.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.080
He's a tall guy at 190 cm, and he hits the ball even if the set isn't perfect.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.460
His back row attack is pretty intense too.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.110
Do whatever you can to make sure he doesn't get over your blocks.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:11.960
Tera!

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.190
So high!

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:16.960
Good!
Get it!

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.060
Tanaka!

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.640
It's long!

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.150
Karasuno Tsubakihara Nice spike!

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.570
Sorry!

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.110
It's all right! Move on!

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.530
Got it!

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.170
Here he comes.
Their number ten.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.490
Lucky, lucky, Tsuba High! Lucky, lucky, Tsuba High!
Even the Smallest Stream Can Become a Great River

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.440
Volleyball is a sport where the ball is usually in the air.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.010
A sharp sense of spatial awareness is absolutely necessary.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:03.400
But there's no doubt that their nerves and being in this gym for the first time are messing with that awareness.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.320
And the one who is being affected the most...

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.260
is Kageyama, whose setting requires absolute precision.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.350
Sorry.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.290
I'll adjust.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.770
Sorry, I'll need a little time.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.710
I know.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.670
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.050
It's too long.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.730
Nice save, Tanaka!

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.530
We've gotta keep things going...

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.980
...until Kageyama's accuracy is good to go!

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.920
You can definitely tell that Karasuno's playing a bit stiff.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.610
Yes. It's rare to see Kageyama make very apparent mistakes.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:01.620
The fact that Kageyama and Hinata didn't get to sync up before the match is gonna hurt.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.290
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:11.920
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.710
Teradomari drops the ball right into Karasuno's court.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.620
He's got good awareness.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.920
And the point gap widens.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.250
Karasuno's setter's definitely off his game. Let's bait him.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.110
There won't be any fast attacks coming! Keep concentrating on the left!

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:20.890
Why, though?

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.160
We're still gonna do fast attacks.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.770
Fly Fly Got it!

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.700
Nice spike!
Yeah!

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.190
Damn it! They went for the left anyway!

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.460
I tried to bait them and got baited instead!

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.310
That one was about half a ball too short.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:05.800
Too high.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.550
Damn it! He actually made that miracle shot.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.320
Come on, let that freak accident pass.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.660
The hell was that?

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.280
That was awesome.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.040
Just a little more.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:33.170
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.580
Even if you tell yourself that you're going to remain calm, panic will eventually hit you.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.760
But if you let that overwhelm you, it's all over.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.310
That's why we need to give them a shot in the arm a bit early.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.930
Whoa, he's throwing Tadashi in pretty early today.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.510
I probably won't be doing anything but serving at this tournament.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:56.610
That's why I played out this scenario hundreds of times in my head.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.170
Listen up, Tadashi.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.730
Don't wait for your nerves to calm down.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.410
Practice making yourself calm.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.120
And the best way to do that is giving yourself a reset point.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.590
During your warmups, look for something that'll be your calm-down spot.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.310
It can be anything from a poster to even an emergency exit sign.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.290
For now, use that bag as your reset signal.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.850
Once my emotions are reset, I need to take aim.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.480
My target is behind their ace...

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.320
To hit there, I have to send the ball over that part of the net.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.520
It veered toward their libero.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.630
Damn, I hesitated.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:56.880
He messed up the receive.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.210
Echigo, finish it off!

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.670
Three blockers!

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.090
Nice!

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.110
Hell yes!
Their first block of the day!

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.560
You took way too long to decide who would receive.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.770
Right!

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.210
Do it again, Yamaguchi!

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:24.820
Yes!

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.710
Yes, yes, yes!

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.250
Just how much did that kid improve in such a short period of time?

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.170
One more!

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:39.920
Maiko!
There!

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.550
Tsubakihara Academy finally ended his run.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.520
But it looks like Karasuno's finally gaining momentum.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.670
All right! Let's get right into those double digits!

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.230
Karasuno Tsubakihara Yeah!

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.060
Tsukishima!

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.710
Nice spike, Tsukishima!

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:01.630
All right.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.590
Nice job! Keep it up!

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.950
But we can't seem to close the point gap.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.140
Okay, I think I got it.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:25.590
Set to me, set to me, set to me, set to me, set to me, set to me!

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.350
I don't think Hinata ever gets scared of messing up.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.130
And the same goes for him.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.000
Right...

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:01.510
on the mark!

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.800
Yes!

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.090
I apologize if I kept you waiting.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.020


00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.070
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:46.300
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.370
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.460
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.860
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.190
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:07.570
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.390
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.660
Turned them into conviction

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:20.120
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.740
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.590
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:34.910
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:40.520
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.230
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:50.660
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990


00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:56.990
Episode Eleven: A Chance to Extend the Rally

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.890
Next time: "A Chance to Extend the Rally."
