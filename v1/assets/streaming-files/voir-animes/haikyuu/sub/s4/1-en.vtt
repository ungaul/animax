00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.900
Heya, Shouyou.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.070
Heading to practice?

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.440
Hey, Acchan.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.360
Yep.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.240
Isn't it early even for an early lunch?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.080
Actually, this is my second breakfast.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.830
I have lunch and snacks packed separately.

Congratulations on going to the spring volleyball tournament, boys' volleyball team! 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.380
I guess this is really happening.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.760
Hinata!

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.720
I forgot to mention this earlier,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.560
but we'll be taking measurements for the pamphlets today, so hurry and come see us right after school.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.390
Could you tell Tsukishima and the other guys that too?

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.520
Sure!

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.020
Hey!

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.480
Let's see who's got the highest reach.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.240
Bring it on, Kageyama.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.240
I'm even willing to make a wager, if you'd like.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.200
Three curry buns.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.030
Deal!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.790
I'm a man who defeated a wild boar!

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.460
Is their teamwork really gonna be okay?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.460
Yeah, well, I defeated a bear!

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.960
Wild boars—


00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.260
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.890
Now, go bask in the orange glow

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.770

Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.230
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !

Haikyuu

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.360
Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.490
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.370
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.380
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.090
If a person tries to live their life swallowing their dreams and passions

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.800
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.850
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.770
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.950
Awaits a land Of thrilling competition

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.320
Unleash everything you've got

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.660
Winning or losing doesn't even seem to matter

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.830
When you're in the zone and everything flows

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.460
In glorious slow-motion Now, go all-out!

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.010

We'll gladly use them!

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.220
Huh?

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.760
Er... Yes, I'm single, but...

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.600
Yeah, I'm content.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.180
Heyo.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.400
How's it going?

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.900
A fourth of the time when I call alumni, they try to set me up with someone.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.700
So about that video... W-Will you do it for us?!

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.330
This is for my precious juniors.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.870
I'll go all-out.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.710
Nurse's Office

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.840
Ready?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.630
Go for it.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.630
I'm ready.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.930
Oh, hey, Hinata.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.430
How'd it go?

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.350
I'm 164.2 cm!

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.390
I've grown a whole 1.4 cm taller!

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.850
Wow, that's great.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.980
What about you, Yamaguchi?

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.400
I've grown 5 millimeters and I'm now 180 cm on the dot!

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.400
You've gotten into the 180s!

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.490
What about you, Kageyama?

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.280
181 cm.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.910
What decimal?
Point nine.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.410
Wow, you grew.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.330
Kageyama Me Grown!

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.420
Yes! I win!

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.750
How so?!

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.840
I grew a whole millimeter taller!

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.760
Wait, you actually remember everyone's height, Hinata?

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.970
I guess you're good at math when it comes to this, Hinata.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.100
Having fun comparing shrimps and pipsqueaks?

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.430
Good work.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.390
Tsukishima!

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.980
You jerk!

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.400
Tsukki, don't tell me...

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.320
That's amazing, Tsukki!

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.280
You finally surpassed 190!

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.660
I order you to shrink, Tsukishima!

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.320
Tsukki!

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.120
I wish I could get that excited about getting my height measured.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.830
Wake up, Hinata!

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.660
The hell are you doing?!

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.120
Hey! All of you pipe down!

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.710
Faculty Office Mr. Takeda, you've got a call.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.120
It's on line 2.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.000
Hello, this is Takeda. I hope I didn't keep you long.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.380
Yes.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.880
Oh, yes!

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.090
Thank you for calling.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.590
Yes. Yes.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.590
Huh?

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.060
Tsukishima got 334 cm!

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.980
Wow, that's the highest so far.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.030
Great job, Tsukki!

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.410
What are they doing?

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.410
They're measuring the highest point they can hit for the spring tournament pamphlet.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.700
Next, Nishinoya.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.410
Oh? I guess that's what you do when you're going to nationals.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.080
They're jumping higher than I can!

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.750
Nishinoya's only about 150 cm tall, right?

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.260
I'm 160, damn it!

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.670
That was 302 cm.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.720
Next, Kageyama.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.100
Here I go.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.690
Um... 337 cm.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.490
Right now, Kageyama's in the lead.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.070
And there's only one person remaining... Next, Hinata.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.030
Right!

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.250
Everyone's being so competitive with Hinata.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.550
What?!

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.470
How high did he get?!
How high?

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.310
Just wait!

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.930
Um...

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.150
333 cm.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.110
Yes!

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.360
That's about the same as you, Asahi.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.190
Damn it. I'm not gonna lose.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.950
You owe me three curry buns.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.410
He's increased five or six centimeters from before.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.580
I guess guys really aiming to go higher are different.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.950
Higher?

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.580
Well, when you're spiking, you're usually just trying to match your height with the ball, right?

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:47.130
But Shouyou's absolutely positive that Kageyama will get the ball to him,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.880
so he's always trying to jump as high as he can.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.890
Things like your form and your running approach are important to increasing your jumping ability.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.190
Basically, Kageyama is gradually making Hinata's jumps higher.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.360
Next, let's compete to see who can get the most blocks!

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.520
The loser buys the winner Gungun Yogurt for a week!

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.150
You're on!

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.780
Is everyone here?

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.650
Gather 'round!

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.610
Yessir!

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.620
Good afternoon!

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.500
Thank you all for your hard work.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.460
This is sudden, but I have some big news.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.170
Kageyama,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.340
you've been asked to attend the All-Japan Youth Training Camp.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.680
All... Japan?!

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.720
Japan?!

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.100
Holy crap!

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.100
Youth... As in...

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.150
The national representatives for under-19 Japan team... right?

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.150
Yeah.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.530
Wow. That's really all I can say.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.490
Shiratorizawa Academy Shiratorizawa Academy
Wing Spiker Wing Spiker That's the same as Ushiwaka!

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.450
Ushiwaka managed to remain a representative until the end,

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.750
That's awesome, Kageyama!

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.290
but who knows if the King will actually last that long?

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.710
All-Japan is like super cool!

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.330
If I remember correctly,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:13.550
it's from the players nominated today that they'll pick Japan's actual under-19 representatives in two years.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.510
To compete against teams from across the globe.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.560
They basically look for 15- and 16-year-olds all around Japan to prepare for that selection in two years,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.690
and then select a tiny handful of the best of the best.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.860
Just being invited to something like that is amazing.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.650
I guess we've been practicing with some insane guys.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.910
I mean, playing versus teams from around the world?

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.030
They're on a totally different level.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.290
Please stop.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.580
But the training camp is going to be held for five days at the beginning of December,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.090
right before the spring tournament starts in January, so it's not a requirement to go.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:48.790
However—
I'll go.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.210
He should go.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.010
I mean, the best in Japan will be there.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.260
Not to mention,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.390
there's no point in a team like us being timid.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.730
What about me?

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.900
Uh, we're talking All-Japan here.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.030
All-Japan.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.900
Representatives for all of Japan under 19.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.780
Do you get that?

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.910
Of course I do!

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.080
So... the only one who got an invite was Kageyama.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.580
Kageyama, make sure that when you get interviewed,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.420
you tell them that your wonderful senior named Sugawara showed you the ropes.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.220
Right... Don't slip in suggestions!

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.550
No fair trying to get ahead, Suga!

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.470
Honestly, I'm wondering why they haven't invited Nishinoya.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.180
True.
Don't let it get you down!

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.680
Well, we are kinda biased.
Let's just keep practicing our asses off!

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.900
Well, in cases like this, I'm sure they consider talent and potential,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.480
but I hear they look at how balanced a player is overall too.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.450
There'll be a lot of guys meeting for the first time, so they probably consider how well they play with others.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.410
And for a libero, I mean...

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.960
They'll probably invite someone who's a bit more mature...

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.830
Mature.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.870
Right.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.380
I can't even argue with that.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.170
All right, listen up!

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.840
I have one more piece of news.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.260
Also happening at the beginning of December,

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.180
there will be a special training camp for promising first-years in Miyagi Prefecture.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.640
Coach Anabara from Jouzenji High School just gave me a call.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:35.610
It's apparently an idea to try to increase Miyagi Prefecture's volleyball skills as a whole.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.570
As this is only open to first-years,

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.200
it's basically a mock youth camp.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.540
A mock youth camp?

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.910
One of our players has been invited.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.080
Tsukishima.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.460
That's so awesome, Tsukki! You're one of the best first-years in the prefecture!

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.300
A training camp?

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.260
I mean, Tsukishima was amazing in the finals!

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.760
What the hell?

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.890
Why is it only first-years?

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.760
Sir! What about me?!

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.600
Well, Tsukishima was the only one invited to this one...

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.520
I mean, the spring tournament is right around the corner, so I'll have to—

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.820
Do your best out there, Tsukishima!

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.400
Yeah! It's rare for you to get a chance to have guys from other schools mess with you.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.530
Fukurodani Fukurodani Fukurodani Brother Brother
Brother Brother's team Brother's team Brother's team
Nekoma Nekoma Nekoma
No, I actually get enough of that already.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.950
Okay, I'll go ahead and tell them you'll both be participating.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.160
Hey.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.170
I'm going on ahead.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.130
Foot of the Slope

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.350
The place that Kageyama's going for the training camp is supposed to be amazing, right?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.560
It's Tokyo's National Training Center.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.060
Yeah, that!

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.570
That's also where current Olympic players train, right?

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.690
I'd love to go there someday.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.030
Why not sneak in?

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.280
Yeah, I'd be arrested on the spot.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.160
Let's all just have fun here, Hinata.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.380
You say fun, but you guys are just gonna be practicing.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.580
Well, yeah.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.310
Your legs aren't moving!

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.310
Come on! Another one!

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:33.060
Kageyama's starting the training camp tomorrow, yet he's still at it.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.320
This is the route from Tokyo Station.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.950
Once you get to Tokyo Station Utsunomiya Line
Utsunomiya Line for Koganei for Koganei

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:34.000
Get in one of the cars toward the back
Akabane Station Akabane Station
West Exit West Exit Bus stop #6

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.820

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.990
Once you get to Tokyo Station

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.780
Take the bus heading to Ouji Station U...

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:34.000

Take the bus heading to Ouji Station U...

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.000
Take the bus heading to Ouji Station

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.380
I wonder if Kageyama got there okay.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.800
I heard that Take gave him detailed directions, so I'm sure he'll be fine.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.020
I hope he didn't write it in cursive.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.930
Huh?

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.640
Something wrong?

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.110
Well, I didn't see Hinata anywhere.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.780
Yeah, I haven't seen him either...

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.450
Shiratorizawa Academy He's usually here by now.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.840
Um...

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:51.990
Haikyuu!!

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:44.980


00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.500
You weren't invited, right?

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.540
Just ignore him.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.540
I don't know him.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.750
He's a total stranger.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.420
Hey! You're Karasuno's number ten!

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.920
Wait, Karasuno?

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.090
Hey! You're the fast attack guy!

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.720
Wait, did he just say he wasn't invited?

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.680
How friggin' stupid are you?!

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.510
Well, I didn't want to get arrested.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.430
What?

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.640
Yeah, that!

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.360
That's also where current Olympic players train, right?

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.230
I'd love to go there someday.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.820
Why not sneak in?

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.820
Yeah, I'd be arrested on the spot.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.490
Yeah, but what would possess you to come here?!

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.990
No, wait. You'd go if you wouldn't get arrested?!

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.000
What the hell kind of thought process is that?!

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.250
You mor—

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.960
You absolute moron!

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.500
Wow, that amazing vocabulary.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.920
I guess even Karasuno's Four-eyes can lose his cool.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.340
Sorry, what?

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.600
Apparently, Hinata infiltrated that first-year training camp.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.430
I guess he's at Shiratorizawa right now.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.690
Way to go, Shouyou!

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.070
He sure does some crazy things.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.030
Shiratorizawa Academy You little shit...

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.610
What the hell do you think you're doing, Hinata?!

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.990
Damn it!

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.370
S-Sorry!

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.330
What?!

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.130
Hinata, being a go-getter and rash are different things.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.340
Don't mistake the two.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.920
I'm sorry!

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.840
Mr. Takeda from Karasuno always seems pretty calm, but I wonder if he's actually scary.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.640
It's not that I think practicing here is more important than practicing at Karasuno.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:48.650
But I want to participate at a training camp that's going to be filled with talented players.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.610
I want to see what they're like outside of matches.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.820
And see why they're so good.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.120
I have to know!

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:05.500
I understand how restless you feel, but that doesn't excuse your actions.

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.630
This also means you'll be causing them trouble.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.590
Please come—

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.050
He's just another ball boy.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.630
That's fine with me.

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.440
I'm finally here!

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.570
Karasuno High School Volleyball Team...

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.940
You're from the team that beat Wakatoshi.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.950
That's... Sakusa Kiyoomi from Itachiyama Institute.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.500
He's one of the top three spikers in Japan, and he's the only second-year here.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.330
And I get to watch him up close.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.500
I'm Kageyama Tobio, a first-year from Karasuno High School!

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.960
I play setter!

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.800
It's nice to meet you!

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.300
Huh? Yeah, sure...

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.020
Oh man... I'm getting so excited!

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.480
He showed up even though he wasn't invited. That's impressive.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.520
I thought he was a junior high kid for a sec.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.030
I wouldn't have known if he wasn't wearing his jacket.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.190
He's even smaller in person.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.450
What the hell?

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.830
Just let the shrimp from Karasuno join.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.580
I'll crush him.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.420
I guess guys Aone's acknowledged are on another level.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.420
To be honest, I'd recommended Hinata.
Faculty Room Yes.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.670
So, if you're okay with it... Yes, right.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.420
Yes.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.640
Thank you very much.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.480
Do you think he'll be okay?

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.020
If Coach Washijou didn't want him there, he'd just say it.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.020
But...

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.570
when you consider who they've gathered there...

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.110
And Coach Washijou is in charge.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.620
He hasn't changed at all.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.200
"Simple is best."

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:12.290
He loves height and power above anything else, and he's always on the lookout for talent to gather.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.010
I don't know how far Hinata's thought this through,

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.260
but this is a really important opportunity.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.720
But...

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.720
I mean... I couldn't have asked for anything better.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.100
Let me just say this.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.610
Without that setter, Kageyama,

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.320
I can't say that I sense any worth in you.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:50.460
If you don't want to be a ball boy, you can go home at any time.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.710
...this might be far more difficult than Hinata realizes.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.270
The floor's not hardwood?

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:22.650
Apparently footage from the court shows up on that screen with a six-second delay at all times.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:23.320
Wow.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.780
So you can thoroughly examine your plays.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.370
That's awesome!

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.620
Gather 'round!

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.250
Now then...

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.130
All-Japan Boys' Youth Team Coach Hitaki Kotarou

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.420
Let's have a word from the Japan Olympic Men's Team Coach, Hibarida. If you would.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.920
Sure thing.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.090
Let's see...

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.550
Japan Olympic Men's Volleyball Team Coach Hibarida Fuki

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:48.180
I'm sure you're tired of us old guys flapping our gums, so I'll keep it short.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.600
"The Japan Team crumbles before height and strength."

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.060
That phrase is pretty outdated now.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.030
Skills and talents aren't meant to be had.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.030
They're meant to be shown.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.660
Public Interest Incorporated Foundation
Japan Volleyball Association
When you go up against teams from around the world, make sure you go wild.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.580
Let's prove to everyone that volleyball is way more interesting than they thought.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.600
Gather 'round!

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.060
Sorry for interrupting practice!

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.940
I'm a first-year from Karasuno High School!

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.950
Hinata Shouyou!

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.450
I'm 164 cm tall!

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.620
And I'm a ball boy!

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.250
Thank you for having me!

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:21.020


00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:40.040
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:45.260
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.340
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:55.430
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.810
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.150
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:06.530
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:11.360
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.620
Turned them into conviction

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:19.080
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.710
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:28.550
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:33.890
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:39.480
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.190
If you say it's too hard, I'll laugh it off

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:49.610
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:50.990


00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:55.990
Episode Two: Lost Episode Two: Lost Episode Two: Lost

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.320
Next time: "Lost."
