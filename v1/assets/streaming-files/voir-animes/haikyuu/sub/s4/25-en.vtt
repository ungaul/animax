00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.000
This timing.

Haikyuu

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.240
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.120
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.500
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.790
'Cause if we give up now It'll all be over

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.280
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.810
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.480
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.420
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.060
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.570
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.250
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.180
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.700
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.570
So let's start smiling

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.020


00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.310
Episode Twenty-five: The Promised Land

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.780
The Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium is absolutely shaking from the roar of the crowd!

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.760
Seriously, what the hell are you two?! Damn it, you jerks!

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.910
Right. That's our cue.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.470
Let's go.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.930
We messed around too much, Tsumu.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.180
You're right, Samu.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.120
Did you see my block, Kageyama?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.940
I'm the one who stopped that.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.140
No, it was me.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.500
It was me!

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.430
Hello?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.820
Crap! I got all worked up and called him.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.880
Er, sorry for calling out of the blue. This is Anabara. Um...

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.640
I saw.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.810
Oh, right. Yes, of course.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.260
Thank you very much!
I was shocked.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.410
Karasuno High School advances to the top 16.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.730
One of the favorites, Inarizaki High School, led by the Miya Twins, is out after their first match.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.650
It's only day two of the spring tournament, but we've just seen will be one of the biggest upsets of the tournament!

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.790
See you again, Tobio.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.180
Sure.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.770
Shouyou.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.410
Yes?

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.530
Which one is he?

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.120
I'm gonna be setting to you one day.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.610
But before that happens,

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.800
I'm going to crush you at the interhigh, so you'd better be ready.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.110
Talk about a sore loser.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.580
What?! I didn't lose!

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.490
The hell are you saying?!
I mean—

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.350
Fly Fly Gather 'round!

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.310
Nice match!

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.270
Ryuu!

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.160
That was the best!

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.230
Thank you!

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.200
If we didn't have them cheering for us, Inarizaki would've overpowered us.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.200
I can't thank them enough.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.870
Thank you so much!

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.660
You guys are awesome!

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.620
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.740
Insult us already.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.490
Losers don't need applause.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.700
Shut your trap, Atsumu!

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.510
Huh?

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.250
You always wear your heart on your sleeve!

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.350
Every good match deserves praise, you dumbass.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.040
When an adult says, "The process matters more than the results," kids aren't really gonna understand.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.780
I think you're the odd one out here, Kita.

Thank you very much!

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.920
Inarizaki was one of the favorites for the tournament.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.450
Where do you think things went wrong?

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.310
In order to win this match, we probably should've been more aggressive.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.640
That was my mistake.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.250
However,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.070
there's no doubt that the players made great strides today.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.650
Say...

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.120
S-Sorry—

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.080
Are you two trying to feel a little relief by apologizing?

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.830
That's not it at all!

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.920
I know, I know. My bad.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.490
But only apologize when you truly feel bad.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.920
I don't think you were wrong to use that fast attack either.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.930
I thought it was going to get through.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.970
Though...

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.810
I hate when you do stuff in matches that you don't do in practices.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.670
Those were the worst two guys to receive that fast attack.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.650
Yeah.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.620
When you guys are really on your game, everyone else usually gets left behind.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.300
But apparently this time, they were really on their game too.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.100
You felt exhilarated, didn't you?

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.090
It's not every day we get to have a match like that.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.230
Good for you.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.390
Kita was smiling just now, wasn't he?

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.180
Yeah... He smiled a few times during the match too.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:16.950
Huh?

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.100
Seriously?

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.560
Still...

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.240
losing sucks.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.890
We did everything we could,

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.100
and I don't have any regrets.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.510
In the end, results are just a byproduct.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:41.820
But I wonder what it is...

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.270
"Well? Isn't my team amazing?"

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.930
I wanted to say that even more.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.280
Please keep saying it.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.430
We'll be juniors you can brag to your grandkids about.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.610
Well, I look forward to that.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.740
Come on. Let's hurry up and get changed.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.190
Tanaka, how long have you been like that?

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.530
Put some clothes on.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.560
Aight.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.310
Tsukki! You've got two jackets on!

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.250
This is the first time I've seen Tsukishima about to shut down.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.480
Well, he jumped plenty today.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.410
Nishinoya! Don't fall asleep there!

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.510
The one who usually passes out first is surprisingly awake.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.620
Yeah.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.920
Maybe he can't actually sleep because he moved around so much.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:10.590
Today, I'm pretty sure I witnessed someone else having that moment.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.800
The second day of the spring tournament.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:28.160
That's the day that he sunk one level deeper into being hooked on volleyball.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:43.040
Haikyuu!!

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.020


00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.420
Fukurodani Morikawa

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.670
Yeah!

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.920
Karasuno (Miyagi)
Inarizaki (Hyougo)
Hey, Karasuno beat the Miyas!

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.640
You didn't notice?

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.450
Didn't you hear all that ruckus?

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.940
Why would I know what's going on outside of my match?

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.190
Well, yeah.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.190
Guess one of the favorites is out.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.110
Man, I wanted to play the Miyas!

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.750
What? Seriously?! I definitely don't.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.420
It's true that Bokuto is actually concentrating today.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:19.430
He had a hard time getting into the match yesterday at first, but ever since, he's been in great form.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.750
No, I need to stop.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:27.510
The more I think about this, the greedier I get, and things go wrong.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.360
I just need to be methodical.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.860
Yes, methodical.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.520
Akaashi's definitely overthinking things again.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.510
That was amazing!

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.030
I think I might become a Karasuno fan.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.470
Hey, who's Karasuno playing next?

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.940
Nekoma.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.720
That's the team you guys played against, right?

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.540
Who do you think is going to win?

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.900
I'm not sure.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.700
But I don't think you can underestimate Karasuno's enthusiasm.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.970
I see.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.650
Karasuno sure is on a roll.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.800
What do you wanna do tomorrow? Should we come watch?

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.690
Yeah, sure.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.740
I'm looking forward to Karasuno's match tomorrow!

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.310
It can't be easy stopping that attack.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.690
Right?

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.210
And this Nekoma team they're up against seemed sorta bland.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.150
They're totally no match for Karasuno.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.600
Piece of cake.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.800
Oh, you'll be eating those words.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.480
Jaybird Inn Jaybird Inn

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.940
And that concludes our story about a snake jealous of a cat.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.180
It must be hard being that snake.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.440
Okay, and next up is sports.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.410
Yamashita!
Here it is!

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:53.080
 National High School Volleyball Tournament Day 2 of the Boys' and Girls' Matches!

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.210
Today was the second day of the National High School Volleyball Tournament.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.870
The seeded teams were added in and both the boys' and girls' teams started round two.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.090
Something unexpected happened in one of the boys' matches.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:01.590
The second match of the day on Court A was between Inarizaki High School, led by the superb Miya Twins,

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.940
and an old guard from Tohoku.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.850
This team also has a first-year setter who was invited to the All-Japan Youth Camp, Kageyama Tobio.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.060
This is the team that's super-aggressive on offense, Karasuno High School.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.060
The Miya Twins gave Karasuno a lot of trouble with their flawless team play.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.650
On the other side was Karasuno's "raider captain," Tanaka Ryuunosuke.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.280
Maybe he was trying too hard, but he couldn't seem to get on his game.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.660
Man, this hurts.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:31.720
Even in the second set, Karasuno's blockers couldn't seem to stop middle blocker Suna Rintarou's fast attacks.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.370
It only seemed like it! That's all!

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.850
Yamaguchi, shut up.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:41.800
Karasuno couldn't take the second set, but then they definitely turned the tables in the third.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.880
Hey! Look! It's me!

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.720
Holy crap, your face, Suga.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.210
Yeah, that's not very flattering... Hey, it's Shimizu!

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.010
Hey! They're totally keeping the camera on Shimizu for way longer!

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.650
She's so beautiful.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.860
Hey! It's Asahi!

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.630
You look like you've killed a man or two in that shot!

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.570
So cool!

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.270
What?

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.680
Is that really what I look like when I'm concentrating?

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.290
You sure do.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.020
See? See that?! My receive!

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.170
Did you see that, Kageyama?!

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:17.830
Nope!
Well, look!

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.420
Kinoshita!
Damn you!

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.600
Shut up!
How embarrassing...

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.890
How come you're out here, Bokuto?

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.740
Aren't you going to watch TV?

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.660
We already did.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.510
Well, I mean, you usually watch it on repeat a hundred times.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.380
Who the heck do you think I am?

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.110
I wasn't on camera that much, so watching it 20 times is plenty.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.360
So you actually watched it 20 times.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.330
Well...

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.680
I'm gonna still be playing volleyball after high school,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:58.280
so I really didn't think things were that different, even though this is my last high school tournament.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.470
Man, I really wish I could play with you guys more!

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.710
You're not going to die, are you, Bokuto?

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.510
Huh? I plan on living until I'm 130 years old.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.030
What are you talking about?

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.610
It's only the second day.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.070
The third round, the quarterfinals, the semifinals, the finals...

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.210
The road ahead is still long.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.030
Yeah.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.920
And we're gonna win all of them.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.450
All right, let's hurry inside.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.180
The flu and the norovirus are going around.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.990
You can't underestimate January.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.170
January?!

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.350
Man... Kageyama just gets more and more amazing.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.150
I think I'm just gonna ask for his autograph now.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.120
You know he probably hasn't figured out his own autograph yet.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.310
He'll just write his name.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.960
All right, I'll come up with one for him!

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.590
I'll even add a heart in there.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.280
Yeah, don't.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.570
Tanaka was really great today too.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.210
That awesome cross-court spike!

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.870
Followed by that razor-sharp straight spike!

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.670
His rebound toward the end was insane.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.130
He seems like the last person who'd play so calm and collected.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.340
If we're talking calm and collected, that's Tsukishima.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:30.340
How does he keep gradually narrowing down the attackers' paths? Is he some kind of master craftsman?

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.600
I'd definitely just go for the ball.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.320
Oh yeah, and then there was Hinata's receive today.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.880
Man, that was a shocker.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.550
I mean, that dig was something,

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:44.320
but that last point... Hinata managed to bump Tanaka's rebound super high.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.900
Oh yeah!

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.990
He did!

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.360
I totally cried!

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.320
I mean, I can't blame you.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.070
You know, watching those guys...

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.050
I don't want to lose to them.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.110
Of course, you never want to lose against your opponents...

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.850
But I don't want them to beat us either!

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:04.760
Exactly.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.030
Hey, don't you go trying that insane cross-court spike tomorrow.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.900
What are you talking about?

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.470
Like I have the guts to do that.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.350
Dude, just do it!

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:14.280
At least lie and say you can!

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.850
Come on, now!

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.290
Yeah, come on.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.610
Women 's Bath Women 's Bath

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.590
Hey, I know that one. It smells really good.

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.240
All the girls in my class use it.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.820
Oh, but you know,

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.130
I heard you're not supposed to use soap on your face or body all the time.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.530
What?!

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.490
But I always scrub as hard as I can!

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.960
I guess I'll try to copy you tomorrow then, Shimizu.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.880
It's pretty embarrassing being watched like that.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.560
You sure are energetic today, Hinata.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.150
I just can't calm down after that match!

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.810
I wanna have another one right away!

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.990
Creepy.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.330
Tsukishima!

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.450
You weren't being sarcastic there, were you?!

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.750
You're gonna hurt my feelings!

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.130
What was that for?!

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:20.840
Shut up.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.560
Hinata... What?!

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.960
The word "consistent" has always described Nekoma High School very well.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.580
After gaining an aggressive new middle blocker, they're bringing their offense and defense to new heights.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.760
Karasuno seems to be on a roll right now, so hopefully Nekoma can put up a good fight.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.100
You jackass! Don't make it sound like we're weaker!

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:45.930
As for the girls' side, one of the favorites, Niiyama Girls', managed to win and move on to the next round.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.270
Well, everyone's saying that Karasuno's better than us.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.930
What?!

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.840
They've beat plenty of good teams.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.870
You dumbass! We're only here because we've defeated good teams too!

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.360
Hey! Why'd you only get your bed out?!

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.810
Really? But I mean...

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.370
Do you really think we could've beaten Ushiwaka or the Miya Twins?

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.290
Hey, don't leave it at that!

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.360
We'll never know unless we try!

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.870
Also, rock might crush scissors, but it loses against paper!

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.900
Well, it doesn't really matter.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.300
We came all the way here to play them and find out who's better.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:27.590
Kenma probably won't care if they happen to lose.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.440
Huh?

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:32.460
But I'm gonna beat him!

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:33.400


00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.320
Wow, it's totally dark.
The heat flickers

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.770
Sorry, Akane. I just got so caught up in our conversation.

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:46.910
Sweat glitters on my skin Shouts echo and shoulders hit

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.550
Don't worry! I called my mom.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:51.670
We asked the sky through the open window

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:57.680
What our summer would be like Tell me, Mr. Future

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.020
Come on, come on, come on The chance is there

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.570
Come on, come on, come on Do it together

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.710
Everybody always wants to stand there

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:17.460
Make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:22.200
We'll never give up We don't want it to end

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:28.160
I will continue on with my imagination

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.680
Rather than an answer in a textbook

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.330
I wanted to be blown away with emotion

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:48.070
This thing that filled my heart with excitement

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:54.280
Was all I could believe in at the time, Mr. Future

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.490
Hello, hello, hello Can't you hear me?

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.030
Hello, hello, hello Give me an answer

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:09.280
I want to struggle and fall and become stronger

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.930
I want to persevere, stand back up, do it again

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:18.670
And never give up Let me run

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:24.640
I will run to where my imagination leads me

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.970
The second you lose is the second you can start over

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:36.540
Even if right now you taste the bitterness of defeat, baby

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.840
Someday that'll change

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:03.180
Everybody always wants to stand there

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.930
Make mistakes, get angry, and struggle

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:12.690
We'll never give up We don't want it to end

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:18.440
I will continue on with my imagination

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.590
I will continue on

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:27.030


00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:36.190
Guess I get to finally show you the Battle of the Garbage Dumpster!

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.420
The Battle of the Garbage Dumpster, is it?

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:42.750
Huh?

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:47.660
After I started this facade of teaching strangers for a while,

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.170
I tried to get players to do the same thing as me,

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:54.390
or things I tried to do but couldn't.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.860
But one day, I started wondering how they felt about that.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.280
In the end, they're not me, nor are they my pawns.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:11.430
I finally realized the obvious, and my teachings weren't a facade anymore.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.540
This is all harder than it sounds.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.250
But you, you're a natural.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.700
It's probably a good thing that you suck at volleyball.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.760
What?!

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.790
You think I'm just trying to show you the Battle of the Garbage Dumpster for your sake?

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:38.110
The ones who want to beat Nekoma more than anyone else right now are my boys.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:42.110
They're not the team you've held a grudge against for so many years anymore.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.610
So you'd better just look forward to it.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:57.000
Thank you for watching!
