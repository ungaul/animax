WEBVTT

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.840
So that's Ryuu, huh?

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.930
I know this is gonna sound rude, but what's so great about him?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.620
We were neighbors up until I moved away in fourth grade.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.080
Hey, giantess.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.290
Don't just stop there. We humans can't get by!

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.250
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.920
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.230
Crap! It's Tanaka from Class 2!

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.820
Hey, you're really tall and super cool, so straighten up!

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.800
Okay, I'm gonna take you to the best place ever today.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.460
Comin' through!

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.030
Ryuunosuke! I told you to quit with that greeting!

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.980
I don't know how to explain it, but he really helped me build up confidence in myself.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.620
Uh-huh? Oh yeah? Is that right?

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.180
I didn't say anything to embarrass you that much! How shy are you?!

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.310
I... have a chance?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.020
How about I walk you home?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.600
That's okay.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.260
I'll carry that for you!

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.350
Just practice.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.020
I didn't stand a chance up until now, but now I do.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.720
Which means I've...

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.760
just been born.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.630
Uh, Tanaka? Get a grip!

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.480
You've been alive this whole time.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.070
This is all your fault, Ennoshita!

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.180
Yeah, whatever.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.000


00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.300
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.920
Now, go bask in the orange glow

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.270
!
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !
Haikyuu

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.410
Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.540
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.420
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.420
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.140
If a person tries to live their life without getting a taste of their dreams and passions

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.850
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.900
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.820
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:04.990
Awaits a land Of thrilling competition

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.350
Unleash everything you've got

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.710
Winning or losing doesn't even seem to matter

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.880
When you're in the zone and everything flows

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.490
In glorious slow-motion Now, go all-out!

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.970


00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.260
Episode Thirteen: Day Two Episode Thirteen: Day Two
Episode Thirteen: Day Two Great job today.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.300
I'm sure that you're already thinking about tomorrow,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.400
but please allow me to say this.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.820
Congratulations on your important victory at nationals.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.320
Yeah!

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.740
All right, let's talk about tomorrow.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.120
I mean...

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.210
The reality isn't gonna change, so I'll just say it.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.130
We're going up against the runner-up team from this year's interhigh.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.850
Inarizaki High School, representing Hyougo Prefecture.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.890
Well, you know...

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.060
You could call them the favorites to win this whole thing.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.770
First, their top scorer is their number four, Ojiro Aran.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.880
He's both very tall and powerful.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.690
Just like Fukurodani's Bokuto, he's on the cusp of being one of the top three hitters in Japan.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.650
And when he's on his game, he has the ability to surpass that.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.310
Just like when we faced Ushiwaka, you always need to think about blocking and digging out the ball.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.280
We'll counter him with our total defense.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.090
And this is their middle blocker, number ten, Suna Rintarou.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.550
He's actually shorter than most middle blockers,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.640
but he has incredible instincts.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.750
Make sure you're constantly on him when he attacks.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.550
He'll definitely get used to our fast attack too.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.960
Make sure you take advantage of the space you have when you attack.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.840
Ojiro and Suna are Inarizaki's main guns,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.400
but what we really have to watch it for is the guy who can precisely use all of their spikers, including those two—

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.040
their setter, Miya Atsumu.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.750
Kageyama, you probably met him at the youth training camp.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.370
Yes, sir.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.370
That guy's said to be the best high school setter.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.580
Supposedly, the way he sets the ball makes it look like the spiker's gotten better.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.840
To be honest, his sets are really easy to hit.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.020
They're consistent and don't waver.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.310
You're actually admitting that?

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.730
Well, his setting isn't the only thing we have to watch out for.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.720
His serves.
Yeah.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.510
Miya's basically been dual-wielding spike serves and jump float serves for a while now.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.950
So we won't know what he'll hit us with until the last second.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.500
It'll be hard to form a serve-receive formation, then.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.870
I heard that he earned the best server award at both the junior high and high school tournaments.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.920
I really didn't need to hear that.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.040
Sorry.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.010
We just won a match, but everyone already looks terrifyingly serious.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.140
The second seed...

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.870
Out of the dozens of teams listed here, we get stuck playing the second-best team?

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.980
The top two teams in the country...

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.230
That means we get to play both of them!

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.480
That's if the top seed Itachiyama makes it all the way to the finals.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.410
They're on the other side of the bracket.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.700
You're right.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.190
But then whatever team beat Itachiyama would become the best, right?

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.160
You're right.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.080
You're right?

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.130
I just can't with you two... I really can't.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.680
How are you two so ridiculously confident?!

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:55.980
Man, it's cold...

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.840
Hey, Asahi. You can do that thing now.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.600
Huh?

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.810
The thing where you mention that it's finally our last tournament, or whatever.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.220
I didn't let you say it at the interhigh.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.660
This probably isn't the time for that.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.390
It's sorta weird, though.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.710
When you're all panicky, I somehow don't feel panicky for once.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.730
Oh, shut up.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.140
Looks like both the energetic crew and the airheaded crew finally ran down their batteries.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.350
Well, everything's been a bit different, including our warmups.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.760
They were probably way more tired than they realized.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.570
Jaybird Inn We all need to make sure we don't get hurt.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.950
Yeah.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.920
Mentally Tough Mentally Tough

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.500
Damn it, what the hell?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.340
Am I nervous?

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.710
No, this is one of those situations where my adrenaline's just pumping.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.350
Oh, Ryuu.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.890
Oh, hey, Kanoka.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.260
You've definitely got a chance.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.680
I guess it's pretty cold in Tokyo too.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.900
Yeah.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.600
How's Saeko doing?

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.970
She's good.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.350
How's your family?

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.800
They're all doing well.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.570
Ryuu.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.510
So, um... I... You've got a chance

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.510
You've got a chance

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.140
It's not even just a chance
It's not even just a chance
You've definitely got a chance
You've definitely got a chance I...
You've got a chance You've got a chance

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:59.250
You've definitely got a chance S-Sorry!

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.140
You've got a chance

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.220
I already have my heart set on another!

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.400
What are you doing, Kanoka?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.900
Wait inside. It's cold out here.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.420
Kanoka grew into a beautiful young woman.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.740
The city at night... An older city boy...

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.210
Did I... just completely...

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.210
misunderstand the situation?

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.600
Pretend I never said anything!

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:31.330
Huh?!

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.120
Oh, hey.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.670
My mom hand-stitched this again for some reason.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.390
Certain Victory Certain Victory You can do it, Kanoka
You can do it, Kanoka You can do it, Kanoka

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.360
Kou, I think I might've just gotten my heart broken.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.310
Huh?!

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.620
U-Uh, it'll be okay?

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.840
Sorry, it's nothing.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.660
I didn't come here to fall in love.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.320
O-Oh yeah?

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.290
I'm going to win this whole thing.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.240
We're playing second.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.170
We can practice on the court at 8 AM for 30 minutes.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.120
Let's be quick.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.600
Yessir!

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.440
Pardon me. Spiking drills are up next, right?

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.140
Huh?

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.630
Um...

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.570
Is he the coach for Inarizaki?

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.600
He definitely seems used to all of this!

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.020
We'd like to spend some more time serving if that's all right!

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.160
If their setter, Miya Atsumu, is super awesome,

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.290
then we should probably aim for him when we return the ball, right?

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.760
Yeah! That's a super smart idea, Shouyou!

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.880
Hang on, guys.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.580
The recording we saw just now was of their qualifier finals,

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.570
but during that match, the player who they usually have in the opposite position wasn't at 100%, so he sat out.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.930
The opposite...

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.930
The player who stands opposite of the setter, right?

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.370
The same position as Sawamura and Ushiwaka.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.660
There's a good chance that they're going to have that player this time.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.760
Now I remember.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.990
"Even if you manage to take down Miya Atsumu, his twin brother Osamu will make up for him."

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.650
The best twins in the high school volleyball scene...

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.820
The Miya brothers.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:49.020
Haikyuu!!

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:42.010


00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.870
Inarizaki's first match is today, so how's the team doing?

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:55.660
That's right.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.240
The first match can be rather scary and nerve-racking for any team,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.480
but we're all pretty calm.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.450
Inarizaki High School Captain Kita Shinsuke

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.160
We're in top shape, so I'm pretty confident we'll be fine.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.130
So what's your goal for this tournament?
Hey, isn't that Machino, the announcer lady?

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.660
To win, of course.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.740
Who's that?!

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.260
What if she tries to interview us too? What should we do?

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.480
They're only talking to powerhouse schools, aren't they?

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.050
Don't worry. They won't come to us.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.380
Good point.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.330
Yamaguchi! Peace signs! Let's go throw up some peace signs!

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.360
Please don't.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.140
I ended up getting told off too!

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.280
Listen up.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.490
You're way more impressive than you seem to realize!

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.350
That goes for your face and your body!

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.200
It's not like Ryuu has a girlfriend, right?

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.530
So keep pushing!

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.780
Keep pushing, and he'll be yours.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.060
But...

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.450
Hey, Kanoka. What's wrong?

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.620
I can't get any serves over at all...

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.490
How can I get better?

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.040
Just keep trying until you can!

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.130
Okay!

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.010
Yeah!

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.520
She probably didn't take that in the direction I meant, but whatever.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.930
I'm so sorry for saying all that weird stuff out of the blue yesterday!

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.040
Forget I ever said anything!

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.520
No, no, it's fine!

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.430
I'm sorry that my brother showed up out of nowhere.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:25.180
Wait.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.110
Did you always have an older brother?

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.840
He's actually my cousin. He lives here.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.280
Whenever I have a match in the city, he always brings over good luck charms and other gifts.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.880
Hey, he sounds like a great guy.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.340
Huh?

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:44.130
Wait, then that means thinking it was a misunderstanding was a misunderstanding...

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.610
So, um...

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.430
I don't slouch anymore because of you, Ryuu.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.600
I've gotten really good, so watch me, okay?

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:07.400
A New Rising Star!

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.330
Amanai Kanoka That's right.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.570
Kanoka is a lot better now.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.400
I'm the one who's getting left behind.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:11.140
I ain't gonna lose!

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.180
Hinata, you moron!

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.540
I wanna hurry up and start jumping!

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.670
You look like you're rarin' to go.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.220
Heya.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.390
How you doin', Tobio?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.440
Fine, thanks.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.390
That one's Miya... Atsumu, right?

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.070
Do your best out there today.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.780
I really hate playin' against people who suck, y'know?

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.160
Damn... Elites sure are scary.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:54.980
Yeah, sorry about that.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.370
Why are you apologizing?! Kageyama, you jerk!

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.330
But I don't suck.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.080
Oh, don't I know.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.630
Though he sucks.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.090
How can you say that?!

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.550
But he's not totally awful, so I think we'll be okay.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.930
The first match is in the middle of their second set.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.800
Even in our alternate uniforms, Noya looks like the star of the show!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.570
I know, right?

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.830
Kageyama, orange really isn't your color.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.780
Shut up, you human tangerine.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.180
The hell did you say?!

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.280
These do feel different, but what can we do?

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.860
Our opponents are in black too.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.430
You're somehow even more annoying now.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:42.800
Tsukishima!

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.420
You're probably the last one who should be saying that, Tsukishima.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.460
Must be nice.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.230
How are they able to stay that calm?

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.720
But you know, Hinata doesn't really get nervous anymore.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.320
Huh?

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.330
He seems to be way more excited than nervous now.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.180
He's actually maturing.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.190
Oh yeah.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.970
Earlier, I saw some girls hold Miya Atsumu hand fans. What is he, an idol?

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.300
He pretty much is.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.220
He's got a different kind of popularity than the champions, Itachiyama.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.820
He's definitely got the skills and impressive plays.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.670
He's the ultimate challenger that has both of those qualities.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.790
They feature him a lot on TV too.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.510
No one in this arena even knows we exist...

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.410
What the heck, Daichi?! Get a grip!

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.030
It gets me even more fired up!

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.430
Looks like Daichi's finally back.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.770
You were pretty tame yesterday.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.600
I was just concentrating.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.600
All right, let's get going.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:49.530
Yessir!

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:19.020
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Ina High!

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.360
I really can't take their cheering section.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:24.350
Does Inarizaki have a top-level marching band too?

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.660
My stomach... Those huge horns are super cool!

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.860
Atsumu!

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.280
Aran!

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.040
Osamu!

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.280
Miya!

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.640
All right, let's go!

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:41.410
Let's go!

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.250
Let's go!

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.210
Let's fucking go!

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.630
Official Warmups Official Warmups Yeah!

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.090
Yeah!

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.760
Nice spike!

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.720
Last one!

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.050
Soul swap delayed timing attack!

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.220
Wow!

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.010
Uh, that's not a delayed timing attack.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.140
He just wanted to say that.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.660
Did the setter just spike right now?

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.690
That was actually pretty good.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.800
But isn't the guy who set even better?

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.320
Good job, Miyas!

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.460
Hinata, nice spike!

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.660
Man, that kid sure can jump.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.830
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.130
All right, the match between the Hyougo Prefecture representative, Inarizaki High School,

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:41.340
Miyagi Karasuno
and the Miyagi Prefecture representative, Karasuno High School, is about to begin!

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.810
Let's have a good match!

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.270
All right!

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.730
Damn it... Why are we freaking out? Calm down!

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.660
No one thought we would beat Shiratorizawa.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.660
Let's surprise everyone yet again!

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.870
Yeah!

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.010
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.520
Wh-What the heck was that?! That was super cool!

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.310
Ready, and... go!

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:32.350
Uh-oh.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.030
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.490
Nice serve!

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.040
Hey, loosen up a bit. You guys are as stiff as boards!

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.430
It's not like he's throwing knives at you!

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.950
Right!

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.160
He's looking at us!

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.840
Don't interrupt my serve again, you squealin' pigs.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.380
Sorry. Could you keep it down during the serves?

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.880
Wh-What?

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.340
They do it all the time on TV!

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.730
It's... ...out!

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.060
Damn it!

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.300
Lame.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.110
Can it!

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.780
My serve toss got a bit away from me.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.740
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.450
Asahi! Stay focused!

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.410
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.680
Is the crowd actually booing at the server?

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.060
They make sure to stay perfectly quiet for their own team's serve,

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.540
but they're loud and cause a fuss when the opponents serve.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.710
Their fans are definitely trained.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:52.960
Uh-oh! It got caught on the net!

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.680
Sorry.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.020
We'll get the next one!

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.520
Both teams are showing strong serves as each side tries to build momentum.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.400
Could the player to keep our eye on this match be the man people are calling the top high school setter,

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.410
Inarizaki's Miya Atsumu?

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.790
Indeed.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.370
But we should keep our eyes on Karasuno's setter as well.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.370
Karasuno High School's Kageyama Tobio...

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:21.130
He's another skilled player who was invited to the All-Japan Youth Camp this year.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.510
We're definitely seeing a setter battle between East and West Japan!

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.930
That jump was really good!

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.310
I forgot to hit!

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.650
If you can't jump and hit at the same time, then don't even try, moron!

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.940
Did he just say that he forgot to hit?

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.120
He did.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:54.370
Are you sayin' the jumps we've seen so far ain't the highest he can go?

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:59.250
Is he really experimenting while playing against us?

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:08.250
I figured Tobio was the kinda guy who marched to the beat of his own drum,

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.820
but apparently that kid's just as bad.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.020


00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.070
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:46.300
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.370
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.460
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.860
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.190
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:07.570
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.390
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.660
Turned them into conviction

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:20.120
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.740
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.590
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:34.910
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:40.520
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.230
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:50.660
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990
