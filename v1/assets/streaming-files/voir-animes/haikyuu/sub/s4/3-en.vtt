00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.330
How creepy.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.040
Yeah.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.400
I hate it.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.010


00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.310
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.930
Now, go bask in the orange glow

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.280
!
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !
Haikyuu

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.410
Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.550
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.420
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.430
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.140
If a person tries to live their life swallowing their dreams and passions

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.860
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.900
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.820
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:47.000
Awaits a land Of thrilling competition

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.360
Unleash everything you've got

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.710
Winning or losing doesn't even seem to matter

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.880
When you're in the zone and everything flows

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.500
In glorious slow-motion Now, go all-out!

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.970


00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.900
Episode Three: Perspective Episode Three: Perspective
Episode Three: Perspective I'm not on the court.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.550
I'm not anyone on that court.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.830
I can't just chase after the ball.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.040
I need to put more of my all into it.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.730
I forgot that I left the jerseys in the washing machine!

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.730
Oh crap!
I'll go hang them up!

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.040
Okay, thanks!

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.990
Third set!

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.200
Bring it!

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.520
Wakatoshi!

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.490
It didn't go up, but he at least reacted to it.
Don't worry about it!

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.820
I basically brace for impact and get all stiff, thinking the spike is about to come.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.280
Left! Left!

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.180
Moving in sync with the blockers.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.920
Guys who are really good are able to tell where the ball is gonna go just from reading the spiker's form.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.450
For example, Morisuke from Nekoma or Daichi.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.300
The spiker's form...

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.860
Nice spike!

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.190
Wakatoshi!

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.550
So cool!

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.530
It's hard to describe. It's like he doesn't make any unnecessary movements.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.670
But even if I was able to move like that, my reach wouldn't be enough.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.010
All right!

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.850
Come to think of it, I don't usually get to watch Noya from behind.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.840
During a match, during practice, or even when I'm watching matches on TV,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.860
all I ever watch is the ball.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.380
Semi Semi, better get that service ace!

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.560
Why are you calling me that?! Stop it!

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.020
That's the guy who was really good at serving during the finals!

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.690
Here comes an intense serve!

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.710
Nice receive!

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.280
Wait.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.590
What's that called again?

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.380
Get one more, Semi Semi!

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.570
It's over!

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.920
Damn it!

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.230
Thanks!

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.940
It's just a tiny little movement.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.660
Tama, practice passing with me!

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.110
What? Again?

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.790
Then help me practice first.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.090
I already planned to!

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.740
Here I go!

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.960
Hit it back! You suck!

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.960
You're not gonna take it easy on me?!

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.070
You have really good reflexes, Hinata.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.890
Sometimes you even hit the ball back decently.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.120
Just sometimes.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.270
But when I think about the fact that I'm about to hit the ball, I put up my guard and can't move.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.350
In that case, take your feet off the ground.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.980
That's a basic form of movement in tennis.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.810
You got this!

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.860
Thanks!

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.520
What was it?

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.830
What else did Tama say?

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.830
Give us a good serve!

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.540
Want me to show you how to smash?

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.510
Whoo! A smash?!

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.120
No, wait. That wasn't it!

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.590
I wanted to do anything to stand out even more back then!

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.670
I'm such an idiot!

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.440
It was spa... S-Strap?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.880
Spl...

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.100
Splatter step?!

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.820
No, split step!

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.810
Don't make it sound gross!

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.250
Split step!

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.230
The moment the other guy makes contact with the ball,

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.150
by picking up both feet from the ground, you reset your form.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.820
Then you use the impact of your feet landing to propel yourself!

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.870
Damn it!

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.730
That guessing guy moves super fast to block.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.650
Now that I think about it, he's completely different from Tsukishima.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.930
That's a crappy place to hit the ball back!

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.580
When did he even look at their side?

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.500
He doesn't seem to be taking an extra step.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.170
So there's more than one way to receive well.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.820
Up until now,

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.140
I've only been chasing the ball.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:40.090
But the court is so full of information.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.710
Thank you very much!

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.600
Thank you!

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.880
See ya, Tsutomu. We'll be back.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.660
R-Right!

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.310
I guess we're gonna start spending the night today.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.540
Man, even the washing machines are great at Shiratorizawa!

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.570
Really?

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.960
By the way, Shouyou, aren't you cold wearing just a T-shirt?

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.690
I'll put a jacket on in a second.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.710
In a second?

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.790
Just so you know, there's no food or lodging for someone who wasn't invited.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.390
Y-Yes, sir!

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.240
We do have places he can sleep, though.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.470
This camp has fewer people than most, and everyone sleeps in one big room together.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.310
Hinata Shouyou came here to create a chance he wasn't given.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.480
Whether or not that was successful,

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.630
the fact is that he wasn't chosen to be here.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.540
And something similar is probably going to happen again.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.910
I see.

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:41.870
Come on!

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.500
Help me practice a bit!

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.110
No thanks.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.610
You're asking the wrong people.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.000
I don't mind practicing with you.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.110
Kindaichi!

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.720
Are you doing some extra practice?!

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.430
I'll pick up those balls for you.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.330
S-Sure... Hell yeah!

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.830
You're not gonna hit any?

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.950
You're not gonna practice with us?

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.580
Why would I?

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.110
Show me those super-sharp straight spikes of yours!

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.600
The ones that get past blockers who are sure they got in front of a straight spike!

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.210
Like, whack!

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.230
How the heck do you even do that?!

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.920
Wh-When was the last time I felt like this?

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.750
This feeling I'd forgotten because I'm surrounded by cold or completely unreadable upperclassmen!

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.310
This feeling of being praised and adored!

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.980
You're so amazing, Tsutomu.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.640
You're so tall, Goshiki!

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.680
You're our ace, Goshiki!

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.640
Y-You just need me to do straight spikes?

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.910
Maybe some cross-court spikes too!

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.640
Damn, he's a pushover.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.190
Also, don't go underestimating what it takes to be a ball boy.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.840
First, my position.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.600
Nagamatsu's blocking over there, so that narrows down where the spiker can hit the ball.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.780
I'm gonna get my hand on the ball.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.410
How fast will I be able to get to where the ball is going to land?

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.600
I need to keep my eyes on the spiker, and then do a split st—

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.880
How crappy is my timing?!

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.240
Jumping's not the goal here.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.740
I need to keep my body flat.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.350
Too slow!

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.060
Too slow!

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.310
Way too slow!

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.780
Left!

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.570
Goshiki?!

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.190
Will he do one of his amazing straight spikes?!

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.150
No, wait. This is probably going to be...

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.720
a cross-court spike.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.010
My hands were full...

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.410
But I was right about where it was going!

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.280
There was a blocker in the way for a straight spike,

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.340
and the set was a bit short.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.910
He can't hit as close to the antenna as he usually can!

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.740
It's easier for me to hit if you can get the ball as close to the antenna as possible.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.630
Roger!

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.810
There are times you can tell where the ball will go from the set too!

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.830
I'm just gonna have to hold out until I get home.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.160
I couldn't wait yesterday and ate a hamburger.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.030
I wonder what the food is like at a powerhouse school.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.140
Hopefully Tsukishima actually ate something.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.250
He likes to leave some food whenever the third-years aren't watching.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.410
To get home, I take a bus,

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.250
then a one-hour train ride, then a 30-minute bike ride.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.360
Your muscles are at their limits, so you recover by eating.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.340
That's how you build muscle.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.270
That's how you get stronger.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.840
So eat.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.810
Eat a proper meal.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.390
My muscles definitely want to be repaired right now.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.860
Usually, I'd be able to head straight home and dinner would be waiting for me, so I never really had to think about it.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.030
What should I eat?

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.760
One sec.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.670
Hey, what's up?

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.130
Coach, what should I eat?

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.150
What?

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.590
Oh.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.570
Wait, I'm sorry. Is it okay that I ask you that?

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.720
Who the hell else would you ask?

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.160
First, you should be drinking a sports drink with amino acids.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.470
But you probably already are.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.440
Oh, right. Uh, one sec!

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.810
You'll need some protein too.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.450
Even convenience stores have protein drinks now.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.700
What you'll also need is carbs.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.050
Something like a banana or 100% orange juice.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.870
And then,

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.210
Go home and eat a proper meal!

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.680
Also, make sure you get some sleep.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.390
Right! Thanks!

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.160
Right, then.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.110
My brand-new travel toothbrush set.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.150
I won't be able to use you just yet.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.150
Just wait a tiny bit longer.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:42.000
Haikyuu!!

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.000


00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.470
Tokonami Tokonami Karasuno Karasuno

00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:00.990
It doesn't matter if this is our usual gymnasium, Shinzen's gymnasium, or Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.370
You need to train your body to be able to do the same thing anywhere.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:13.490
It's out!

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.190
You got this!

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.840
Sorry!

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:23.980
Got it!
Nishinoya!

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.710
Got it!

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.610
Sorry!

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:30.230
Shake it off!
My bad!

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:53.370
Tanaka's little routine he does now that he does jump serves is somehow stupidly cool.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.110
My bad!

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.380
Though he still has to work on getting the ball over the net.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.380
You'll get the next one!

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.340
Tokonami Tokonami Karasuno Karasuno

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.190
Hell yeah! We managed to win a set against Karasuno!

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.730
We can go to nationals now!

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.060
One lap of diving drills!

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.380
Yessir!

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.760
Wait, they actually have penalties?

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.020
Oh, we just do this all the time.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:26.340
After getting so used to losing at the Tokyo training camp, I get the urge to do these even when we win.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.280
Right?

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.660
Yeah, we sorta messed up the serves this set.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.320
May we play another set?!

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.410
O-Of course.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.300
The set is a bit high.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.670
So...

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.800
he won't be able to hit it straight down!

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.020
Damn it! I was totally right too.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.730
His movements are completely different from the first day.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.050
It was too high. My bad.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.270
I'm sure he's got extremely good natural athletic abilities,

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.890
and before, his movements tended to rely on instinct.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.160
It was still inbounds. Nice spike.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.700
But now, he's considering his movements.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.160
Even though he's a bit clumsy currently,

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.240
as he builds more experience, Bring it!

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.860
his thinking will start to merge with his instincts...

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.900
and transform into intuition.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.010
Not to mention, when he was blocking in the match against Shiratorizawa,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.850
it seemed like he didn't even know the basics.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:46.040
It seemed more like he was trying to find what worked best for him.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.780
Nice spike!

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.400
Because he's so empty that there's no unnecessary filler.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.850
Wait, wait. "Empty" was probably a bit too harsh.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.710
Sorry about that, Hinata.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.020
Whoa!

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.900
Once you're playing in an actual match, everything's more frantic,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.010
and you don't know who's gonna hit until the very last second.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.760
That part's different from tennis.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.260
Not to mention, guys tend to hit the ball really fast.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.350
So is there really time to incorporate the split step?

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.130
Break time!

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.040
Yes, sir!

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.990
I'm obviously moving around way less than in normal practices,

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.880
but all this thinking is making me hungry too.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.870
Well?

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.050
Are the monster children still working hard?

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.170
Monster?

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.760
They totally seem like monsters! Karasuno's number nine and ten, I mean.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.480
We... eat humans...

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.560
True.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.370
I mean, you're basically a monster yourself, Wakatoshi.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:18.450
I wonder if he'd get mad if I asked if he was worried about his brethren.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:21.880
Here are your drinks!
Thanks.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.370
Here!

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.990
Here!

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.520
Why are you like that?

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.700
Like what?

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.580
You always seem so desperate.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.010
Well, I decided I was gonna defeat Kageyama.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:46.270
But right now, he's All-Japan...

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.010
I figured he was there.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.650
I mean, he's amazing too,

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.650
but he might be getting his ass whooped right now.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.550
Oh?

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:16.960
Thanks!

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:23.890
Whoa, there!

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:25.600
I can hit it!

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.690
Nice save!

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.780
Crap.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.510
Oh well. This is still the first set.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.040
Sorry. Force of habit.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.150
My bad.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:01.510
A set that basically said, "Of course you're this far into your approach already, right?"

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.960
That's what I like to see!

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.070
Time for more spiking drills!

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.520
Yes, sir!

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.940
I'll go on this side!

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.480
O-Okay.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.810
He seems way too excited to be a ball boy.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.140
He kept getting them last night too.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.270
Seriously?!

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:31.830
He's acting like...

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.620
he's the only one in the middle of a match right now.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.680
Ugh, I hate this.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.870
I always feel like I need to do something whenever I see him.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.450
I need to smoothly read the next move too, not just when I get the ball.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.150
I'm going to be receiving this spike.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.810
I'm a receiver who's been tasked with defending a part of the court!

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.990
Dumbass.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.200
I-I actually feel bad about that.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.160
I keep tellin' you to keep yer damn eyes open!

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.200
Yes, sir!

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.090
Shiratorizawa Academy

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:07.580
Hey.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.010
Yeah?

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.980
Come with me for a sec.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.020


00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.040
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:46.270
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:51.340
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.430
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.830
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.160
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.520
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.360
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.610
Turned them into conviction

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:20.080
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.710
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.560
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.880
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.470
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:45.180
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:50.630
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:51.980


00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:56.990
Episode Four: "Easy"

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.540
Next time: "'Easy.'"
