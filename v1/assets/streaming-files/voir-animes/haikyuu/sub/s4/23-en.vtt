00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.240
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.550
Inarizaki seems to be adding their captain, Kita Shinsuke, back in.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.950
Are they strengthening their defense?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.160
I believe so.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.820
Inarizaki seems stronger, both defensively and mentally, when he's on the court.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.430
I probably shouldn't be the one to bring this up.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.160
What?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.290
Wouldn't putting me back in right now be passively defensive?

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.460
What?! This is my best offensive move!

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.020
The Miyas are totally on point today.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.080
So if I'm putting you in, it means that the last thing they should do is step on the brakes.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.700
We don't need the memories

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.300
To be honest, I don't like that motto.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.860
It's not like the path is only in front of us.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.910
Focusing and being rash are two different things.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.830
I don't understand guys like them at all.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.660
That said,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.780
watching them does make my heart stir.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.130
I'm not a player that can change the flow of things,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.980
but I feel like I need to watch the backs of these guys who just keep running ahead.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.100
Pretty sure I can do it now.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.730
I bet...

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.040
you're in the same boat.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.980


00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.780
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.000
Haikyuu !
!
Haikyuu

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.250
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.130
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.510
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.800
'Cause if we give up now It'll all be over

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.290
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.820
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.490
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.430
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.070
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.580
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.260
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.190
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.190
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.710
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.580
So let's start smiling

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.030


00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.240
Episode Twenty-three: The Birth of the Serene King

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.250
Got it!

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.620
Go again!

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.000
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.560
Looks like you don't have enough stamina.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.800
Probably.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.540
It's coming back.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.670
We can score here!

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.560
Got it!

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.580
Synchronized attack!

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.930
We're not syncing up!

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.200
Their timing was off!

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.610
That mistake's gotta hurt for Karasuno High School!
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.030
Damn it! It was too high.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.680
My b—

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.210
Could you not apologize?

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.450
I just didn't jump high enough.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.520
Always jumping with the intention of hitting the ball over.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.790
Always making sure there's enough distance for the running approach.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.920
Hinata always does this?

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.990
Actually, even more than this?

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.150
Shut up.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.970
I estimated wrong.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.630
It's my mistake.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.850
It's amazing how insincere you seem.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.270
So, can you do this?

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.820
Of course.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.610
We're gonna get the next one!

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.830
Yeah!

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.580
I'm pretty sure they still could've gone for the ball.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.210
Let's nail this one!

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.590
Serving for Karasuno is Azumane Asahi.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.840
He's definitely one of their best servers, but I'd say he's only been nailing about half of his serves today.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.890
Things are still up in the air.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.600
Well, they're behind in the final moments of the match.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.610
I'm pretty sure he's feeling even more pressure than he's used to.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.130
A hundred percent...

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.460
Bring it!

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.500
He did it! Azumane Asahi, showing us why he's the ace!

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.130
That's a service ace!

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.760
Nice, nice, Asahi! Push it, push it, Asahi! Do it again!

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.570
Good job, samurai boy!

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.330
Kick-ass serve!

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.600
Damn those geezers!

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.120
The Karasuno samurai...

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.190
He probably starts off at around 80 percent, then gradually gets more and more powerful throughout the match,

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.010
letting loose his full power at the very end.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.510
Man, I'm hungry, Samu!

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.540
Same here, Tsumu.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.540
Do it again!

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.540
Shinsuke!

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.040
Nice receive!

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.670
Captain Kita cleanly gets up that powerful serve!

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.300
Damn. I have no idea if I could've gotten that one.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.300
Who's Miya Atsumu going to set to?

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.210
Please come together for a powerful two-man block!

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.140
Yes!
Help!

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.850
Got it!

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.070
Nice receive!

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.580
Man, what the hell?

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.110
This is definitely it!

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.490
Wait, he's in the back row!

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.200
It has to be now!

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.240
Every single time, "now" is the best chance we've got!

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.370
Twins' fast attack...

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.170
...minus tempo...

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.570
reverse!

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.140
Nice save!

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.740
I don't want to lose.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.550
We can't lose.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.190
I'm not gonna let it end like this!

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.070
Now, just watch me get the next one!

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.690
"I don't want to lose."

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.620
"We have to win."

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.030
How could we be so naive?

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.750
Victory and defeat are just results!

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.960
Our concept doesn't change.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.170
This point right now...

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.630
...is what we're fighting for.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.050
Synchronized attack!

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.880
During their match with Shiratorizawa, they didn't do a single back row attack.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.920
They only did it once today as a surprise attack to cut off Atsumu's serves.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.860
What's the point in doing an attack when you're not going to be there to back up your teammates?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.440
I'm not here to protect my teammates.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.650
Each and every one of us is here to score!

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.160
Inarizaki Karasuno Yeah!

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.380
Karasuno managed to grab hold of the distant Inarizaki from behind!

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.310
Yeah!

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.360
The goddess of victory turns her gaze toward Karasuno!

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.320
Inarizaki Karasuno Karasuno takes the lead!

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.040
Things seemed pretty grim when they couldn't score after Hinata's incredible receive.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.460
Ever since that timeout, it seems like Karasuno is over whatever was dragging them down.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.430
Damn, that was high.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.920
Inarizaki High School's not wasting any time catching back up.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.130
I think these eight seconds are my second favorite, after chow time.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.020
Get it!

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.980
Kageyama, finish it off!

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.490
He definitely went after their setter.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.150
Osamu!

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.610
Hey, it's that thing they did earlier.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:14.120
Nah, I can't imagine they'd try that unreliable fast attack again so soon.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.300
They're definitely going to do it.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.710
You think so too, don't you?

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.530
One and a half blockers!

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.100
Inarizaki Karasuno
Inarizaki High School takes the lead back again!

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.510
One more!

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.310
Nice spike!

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.180
Not bad, Samu!

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.850
Right?!
Yeah!

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.610
Looks like the Karasuno blockers were distracted by Atsumu on the right for a bit.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.730
I see.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.540
I'm sure they're exhausted physically and mentally.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.290
Damn, I want some carbs right now.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.580
Tanaka!

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.650
Three blockers!

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.250
Nice spike!

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.340
Yes, yes, yes! Great job!

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.240
Nice spike!

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:14.910
Yeah!

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.480
Tsukishima and Hinata still aren't the best servers,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.880
so they're probably going to give up a point during this rotation.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.200
But that's exactly why scoring here will mean so much!

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:27.560
Aran!
Got it!

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.080
Gotta touch it...

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.410
Gotta touch it, gotta touch it, gotta touch it, gotta touch it, gotta touch it, gotta touch it, gotta touch it, gotta touch it...

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.080
And no one expected that setter dump!

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.540
Hell yeah!

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.240
Hey! Snap out of it!

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.040
Save your regrets for later!

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.210
Just as Inarizaki's Kita moves to the front row,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.010
they're putting Ginjima back in.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.010
You got this.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.030
Yes!

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.360
The powerful serve is spiked back almost immediately!

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.360
Yeah!

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.600
Looks like Inarizaki's going for the checkmate!

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.410
Inarizaki Karasuno Nice spike, Hitoshi!

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:24.410
Nice spike, Hitoshi! Push it, push it, Hitoshi! Do it again!

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.700
We're gonna stay calm.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.670
We'll get that point!

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.880
Concentrate!

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.840
Damn it, you've got this!

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.580
It doesn't matter if you're tired!

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.680
It doesn't matter how good the other team is!

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.500
Who the hell cares if you're already doing your best?!

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.150
Try harder, damn it!

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.860
This is...

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.050
crazy.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.360
Inarizaki Karasuno It feels weird.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.490
I think I'm actually on a roll.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.830
I feel like I'm seeing blocks better than I usually do.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.790
Maybe that's why...

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.880
my instincts are telling me not to go any harder.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.800
Kageyama...

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.470
I'm gonna swallow my pride and ask you to do this.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.430
Cut back on how many sets you send my way for a bit.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.400
No.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.360
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.030
Get it!

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.950
Tanaka!

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.110
Kageyama!

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.980
Karasuno follows one fast attack up with another!

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.170
But Ojiro managed to get the ball up! Can they keep the rally going?!

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.650
They're not gonna be able to get off a decent attack!

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.030
Holy shit.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.660
Both setters are some of the best in the nation!

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.910
They're showing off some insane moves!

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.750
Inarizaki Karasuno No.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.170
We need your attacks, Tanaka.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.880
That...

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.340
wasn't him trying to make me feel better.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:41.800
Kageyama!

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.890
It's normal not to know what others are thinking.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.350
You need to know the current state of the match and your teammates' conditions.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.060
Ever since the end of the first set, Tanaka definitely hasn't been doing bad at all.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.370
He's been staying calm even at times he'd usually go crazy.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.170
That cross-court spike he pulled off was amazing.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.740
But is that really Tanaka's best weapon?

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.830
Everyone on our team is good at what they do.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.620
No,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.770
that's not for me to decide.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.310
After landing so many insane attacks,

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:26.030
even at the end of this match, with long rallies, recovering from messed-up receives...

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.780
It's not too short, not too long, not too close, nor too far.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.890
A beautiful set stretches over our side.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.360
Send it further, right to the very edge.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.820
I need to give my spikers options!

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.780
Ever since that insane cut shot,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.820
it's been subtle, but the blockers have definitely shifted for a cross-court spike.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.730
Another path that Tanaka pried open for us.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.700
That wasn't him trying to make me feel better.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.630
I'll make all the trust he put in me...

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.460
the right decision!

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.480
A spike right on the line!

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.060
I can't believe how close that was!

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.860
Yeah!

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.910
Tanaka Ryuunosuke makes his presence known once again!

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.740
That really was an insane straight spike!

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.620
And his positioning suggested he was going for another cross-court spike!

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.580
Nice, Ryuu!

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.470
Nice set!

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.620
Nice spike.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.200
Where...

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.480
Where the hell'd Goody Two-Shoes go?

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.370
What the hell happened in this short amount of time?

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:11.980
Karasuno High School's Tanaka Ryuunosuke just sliced through Inarizaki's defense with that spike!

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:22.840
That guy's weird.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.210
Ma, shh!

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:41.980
Haikyuu!!

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:34.970


00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:47.440
Inarizaki Karasuno
Karasuno shows no signs of slowing down, but Inarizaki's at match point.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.910
A service error or a serve that's too easy to receive...

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.690
will mean that Karasuno loses.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.970
I know I don't need to guard my head,

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.580
but I still want to protect it!

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.140
Seriously, what the hell's his deal?

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.810
Did you see those nerves of steel?! That unbreakable concentration?!

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.140
An amazing service ace ties them up once again!

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.410
This is Kageyama Tobio!

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.480
Yes!

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.710
This is going beyond amazing to annoying.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.620
Bring it!

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.790
Seriously.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.810
His play today...

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.300
Up front!

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.220
At the very last possible second,

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.680
Kageyama seemed to know exactly what the receivers were thinking and dropped the serve up front!

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.280
Let's go!

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:05.610
With lightning speed, Karasuno gets one right down the middle!

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.740
Yeah!

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:13.070
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.450
They knew their opponents were thrown off their game!

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.670
What an incredibly fast hit down the middle!

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.070
Now Karasuno's nearing checkmate!

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.780
Nice receive!

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.920
You're only the ace if you can attack and defend!

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.690
They knew exactly what they were doing there! Ginjima scores on the left!

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:45.440
I'm pretty sure they're all exhausted by now, but they didn't give the blockers even the slightest hint.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.400
What a beautiful set.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.710
Even though we're at the very end of the match, he's not thrown off at all,

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:57.620
and Atsumu seemed to know what they were thinking when he set the ball.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.610
That guy's definitely a prodigy.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.470
It's painful playing the same position as him.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.260
Kageyama's serves are crazy too.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.270
Man, I wish I had talent too.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.840
I don't remember when, but someone once asked me this.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:18.100
"You're not a starter, so isn't it hard to have such a prodigy who's younger than you on the same team?"

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.350
I'm not sure what qualifies as a "prodigy,"

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.600
but I understood what they were trying to say.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:31.740
There happen to be people who think that someone like Atsumu was just born a talented player.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.530
However,

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.470
everything I do every day, on a scale from one to ten,

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.950
guys like Atsumu do on a scale from one to twenty.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.410
Or it's a more effective ten,

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.290
or a denser ten.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:53.800
And sometimes, instead of one to ten, they try things from A to Z.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.400
That's what goes through their heads.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:03.720
Even if they mess up sometimes, or they're hated by strangers, or they get cast out,

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.270
or if they completely ignore something we'd consider important,

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.180
they just have to do it.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.980
Even if they start coughing up blood, they're the guys who just wanna keep running.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.450
I touched it!

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.270
There are plenty of guys in this world who we're no match for,

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.960
and it's natural to find people like that amazing.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:29.270
I think being able to dive headfirst into things is a talent in and of itself,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.130
and it doesn't matter what you call them.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.590
And it's not like "prodigy" is an insult.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:41.220
But if you're thinking they're prodigies from the start,

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.660
that just means you've lost before you even faced them.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.270
And it's rude.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.230
Sorry, it's long!

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.750
Karasuno manages to dig out another one!

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.330
What a long rally! Their sheer willpower is on display!

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.180
Damn it... Just five more centimeters...

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.920
I should be able to reach that!

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.650
Jump higher!

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.080
Reach it!

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.410
Shit!

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.910
His foot!

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.470
Hinata Shouyou shows incredible balance and instinct!

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:26.430
Inarizaki Karasuno
Karasuno somehow manages to stop Inarizaki from getting back-to-back points!

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:30.640
Wow, I'm sure Hinata plays with the ball all the time.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.080
Damn it!

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.900
Don't get tired now!

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.110
I know you didn't mean anything by it.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.550
Sorry for going on that rant.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.680
No...

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.840
I think it'd be worse if I said that without thinking.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.290
Damn, my brain is gonna be sore tonight.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.290
Complain, damn it!

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.000
Complain? Why would I?

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.210
Gimme the next one too!

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:06.950
I thought Kageyama had nothing to be scared of anymore.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:07.810
But...

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.310
it's not just the other team that can push you beyond your limits.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:21.400
I'm moved, Shouyou.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:21.990


00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.880
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:35.630
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:52.310
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:58.820
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:04.820
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:10.830
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.540
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.380
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:28.390
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:34.140
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:40.320
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990


00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:57.000
