00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.600
This position.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.310
This timing.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.230
This angle!

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.700
It's all perfect!

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.500
Wow, you really did do it.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.630
I can't be as accurate as Tobio,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.380
but who doesn't wanna copy cool things when they can?

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.090
Man! You guys can trust each other so much because you're twins!

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.600
It must be nice being brothers!

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.930
Trust each other?

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.640
It's not like I actually trust Tsumu.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.440
He never listens to me.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.400
Osamu, what the hell?! Why didn't you wake me up?!

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.240
I did. And I told you I was going early because I'm on class duty.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.570
He never returns things he borrows.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.370
That's my jacket.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.280
Can I borrow it?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.370
You can ask that once you return the damn thing first.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.160
I didn't eat it!

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.210
Seriously?

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.620
And he lies.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
But who needs trust anyway?

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.470
I mean, I know the ball's comin'.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.930


00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.730
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.950
Haikyuu !
!
Haikyuu

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.200
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.080
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.460
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.760
If we give up now It'll all be over

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.220
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.770
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.440
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.360
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.030
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.540
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.210
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.130
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.130
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.640
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.520
So we're smiling for now

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.970


00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.100
Episode Fifteen: Found Episode Fifteen: Found
Episode Fifteen: Found

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.350
Daichi!

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.610
Asahi!

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.200
Look at that speed!

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.000
They're basically on par with Karasuno's first-year duo!

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.250
You really creep me out.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.090
Aw, flattery will get you nowhere!

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.550
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.130
Got it!

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.850
Sorry! Someone get it!

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.310
It seems that Tobio tends to go for a fast attack even more when the receives are messy.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.780
And considering we just pulled off one ourselves, he's probably gonna go for...

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.570
Shouyou!

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.870
Shut down!

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.750
Inarizaki just shut down Karasuno's main attack!

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.460
It's almost like he blocked knowing for sure that the ball would go to Hinata.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.010
Hinata, Kageyama, calm down.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.420
Don't get so worked up.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.930
I'm my normal self.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.390
Oh yeah?

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.060
Inarizaki Karasuno The Miya Twins are unstoppable!

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.640
They're truly the ultimate challengers!

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.570
Their number ten is small but an excellent scorer.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.490
It must be depressing when someone else can use your unique attack so easily, though.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.990
You think so?

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.870
I doubt he got much attention without Kageyama prior to this.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.880
But it's not like he's going to keep playing with Kageyama as his setter forever.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:49.850
Basically, what that fast attack shows him is that there are other setters like Atsumu who can get him the ball.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.440
I think it's welcome news for him that it's not exactly unique.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.810
Not to mention...

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.820
I wouldn't call that face "depressed," would you?

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.740
Sorry! Get it!

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.670
Looks like your unpredictability is gettin' predictable, Tobio!

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.460
That's out of bounds!

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.100
That ball was touched by the blockers!

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.220
That's a point for Karasuno!

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.140
Kourai, that was... He definitely saw that.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.230
Yeah!

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.400
I'm my normal self.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.900
He wasn't even trying to act tough.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.030
He's just trying to set the ball the best way he knows how.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.870
He's fully aware that what happens afterward isn't always in his hands.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.040
The old Kageyama would've probably tried to do everything on his own.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.180
Up front!

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.470
Gin!
Got it!

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.650
This time it was Karasuno that stopped them!

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.280
First-year Tsukishima Kei stopped the Miya Twins!

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.780
We did it!

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.700
The deviant fast attack's biggest enemy is when the blockers get used to it.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.750
As for examples of deviant fast attack killers...

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.340
I'd say either Aone from Date Tech or Inuoka from Nekoma,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.710
who've stopped Hinata plenty of times.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.340
Nice, Tsukishima!

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:54.560
Or someone who's seen the deviant fast attack many times on a daily basis and probably hates it.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.430
Like Tsukishima.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.480
I've always wanted to stop one of those.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.900
What?

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.370
I touched it!

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.420
This is the first time I've heard of Karasuno, but they've got quite the lineup.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.500
That fast attack is insane, that samurai dude is strong, and their libero's really good.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.260
Left!

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.590
What about their number five? The kid with the crew cut.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.090
He's energetic, I guess?

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.050
What the hell, man?

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.280
Hell yeah!

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.700
Yep! Energetic!

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.580
Inarizaki Karasuno
And Inarizaki High School immediately calls for a timeout.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.130
They're physically cutting off the streak.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.090
Great job out there, Tsukishima!

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.300
I was able to stop that last one because it was easy to read,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.640
but that fast attack's still going to be plenty of trouble.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.760
True that.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:17.850
Hinata.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:18.970
Yes?

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.640
I'm leaving one of the twins to you.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.940
I need you to be like Inuoka.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.280
Fly Fly

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.080
No sighing!

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.380
Daichi!

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.920
Damn you all, with your powerful serves...

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.800
Whoa, Tsukki's gonna take flight!

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.390
Come up here...

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.100
and get it!

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.650
You little...

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.200
This is definitely higher than the ones from Shiratorizawa!

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.920
Tsukishima Kei is definitely shining on both offense and defense!

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.830
That one sure was high.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.750
Come on, guys. At least high five or something.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.840
Tsukishima's got the "That went well, but I'd rather die than admit it" face.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.840
And Kageyama's is a "He's glaring at me, so I'm glaring right back" face.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.810
How can you even tell, Ennoshita?

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.310
It hasn't been that long since the Youth Training Camp.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.650
What the hell happened to Tobio since then?

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.490
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.070
All right.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.990
Let's do this!

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:15.970
Haikyuu!!

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:08.960


00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.930
I swear, this never gets easier.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.640
You got this.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.480
Not to mention, we're up against people I've seen on TV and in magazines!

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.020
Hey, Kinoshita Hisashi, age 16.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.780
The current Inarizaki receivers are Ginjima Hitoshi, age 17,

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.490
Miya Osamu, age 16, and Akagi Michinari, age 18!

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:42.950
That's all!

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:51.170
So we're not up against college guys, adults, or aliens.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.680
Nice serve!

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.970
I'm leaving one of the twins to you.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.930
I need you to be like Inuoka just this once.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.770
Hinata is gonna stay on Miya Osamu.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.360
So for any attacks from the left or center,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.700
I need you guys to block with two blockers, no matter what.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.610
Got it!

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.200
If he takes a running approach to his block, Hinata's point of impact is one of the best on the team,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.660
and he's got quick reflexes.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.210
He'll do fine.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.920
Sounds like something a mildly intelligent animal could pull off.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.670
Are you jealous that I got assigned a big role, Tsukishima?

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.260
Sure, yeah.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.760
Come on, Tsukishima. Don't get lazy with the retorts.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.180
We've got this!

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.640
Hinata's commit blocking Miya Osamu?!

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.900
It hit my hands!

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.360
He does it!

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.870
The little guy at 164 cm blocked the 183-cm tall spiker!

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.790
Karasuno High School has tied the score for the first time!

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.910
Inarizaki Karasuno Inarizaki Karasuno

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.790
Inarizaki Inarizaki Karasuno Karasuno

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.960
D-D-D-Did you see that, K-K-Kageyama?!

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.000
You just got lucky.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.380
You're more surprised than anyone else here.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.510
That kid sure can jump.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.640
He suddenly showed up in front of me outta nowhere.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.720
I definitely wasn't expecting a commit block.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.230
Neither was I.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.270
Hinata did it.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.270
Yeah.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.190
But that was basically like a surprise attack.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.650
You're gonna have to keep at it.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.200
Got it!

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.330
He's not going to take that lying down.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.910
Atsumu just did the same attack twice in a row.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.960
That was a nice serve!

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.250
I couldn't force their setter to dig it out, though.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.090
I could've aimed that one a lot better!

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.260
We can score here!

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.350
The ball's right above the net!

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.150
We're not up against college guys, adults, or aliens.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.030
But I know...

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.450
they're a different kind of high schooler.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.410
They're high school kids who've worked harder than me and have way more experience.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.790
I don't stand a chance.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.750
But they do!

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.500
Our deviant first-years definitely do!

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.420
That kid's got a huge vertical.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.050
But that's basically all he's got.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.980
Inarizaki managed to push it to the other side!

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.940
Guess you're not as tough as I thought you were.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.740
What can he do?

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.530
They have a lot more experience.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.370
That last joust ended up how it did,

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.990
but it's probably really stressful being beaten in one-on-one blocking like that.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.870
Especially because he managed to get that first block by luck.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.500
Inarizaki is learning how to deal with the deviant fast attack.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.550
So let's go ahead and try blending in.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.970
Got it!

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.340
All according to plan!

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.390
Did you actually forget?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.310
It was in your mind at first,

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:39.400
but ever since you saw the twins' fast attack, you started thinking about how yours is faster.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.600
Is that it?

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.110
Don't get so worked up!

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.780
That's the second time I've told you today!

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.900
Yessir.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.110
That goes for spikes and blocks.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.870
Go for it again!

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.920
Nice receive!

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.040
I touched it!

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.460
Sorry, it's close to the net!

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.930
Dammit!

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.640
I put too much strength into that one.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.680
Wake up, Samu!

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.930
I am awake.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.140
Stop lying!

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.400
Goin' in there like, "I'm just gonna be the decoy." I see right through you!

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400
Shaddup.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.110
If I jumped for every ball, I wouldn't make it to the end of the match.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.320
If you'd hit the ball, you'd get it over, so hit the damn ball!

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.280
Or what, are you scared of that tiny little blocker?

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.660
Like hell I am!

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.370
Really?!

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.790
Y-Yeah.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.120
He's not scared?

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.420
I guess a scary blocker would be more like...

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.300
Aone.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.340
But Date Tech also comes at you with at least two guys and looms over you.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.220
One-on-one...

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.940
Who was the most annoying blocker when I went one-on-one with them?

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.400
Who was it?

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.320
Who was it?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.030
An annoying blocker.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.940
Who was it?
Annoying.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.700
Who the heck was it?

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.320
Don't slack, don't slack, don't slack!

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.370
I know!

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.040
The blocker I hated facing one-on-one the most was...

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.210
Please don't hit a cross-court spike, okay?

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.500
You can't hit it this way, right?

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.800
Yeah!

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.510
He made me hit a straight spike?!

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.770
Their number ten isn't coming?

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.060
Blend in!

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.610
Synchronized attack!

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.320
All right!
Yeah!

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.740
Fly Fly Karasuno with back-to-back points!

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.290
They're tied up yet again!

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.160
Shouyou, was that on purpose?

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.160
Yep.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.500
I really hated that guy's blocking.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.040
Huh?

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.710
Don't get sick now.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
Well, whatever. Good job!

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.260
Thanks!

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.390
You're not the one who scored, though.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.510
I'm no longer just all about offense—

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.350
Hey, listen!

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.810
Damn it, Kageyama!

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.060
Man, I'm getting hungry.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:26.900
Huh?

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.730
Karasuno's doing way better than I thought they would.
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:37.070
This match essentially looks like the newcomers challenging the better veteran team,

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.620
but it's actually Inarizaki that's trying to deal with Karasuno.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.370
At least for now.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.540
Coach Ukai's grandson understands that too.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.080
He's keeping their balance by using surprise attacks,

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.880
but once they stop, they'll be overwhelmed.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.760
The real battle might be when they finally use up all their surprises.
Miyagi Karasuno Miyagi Karasuno Hyougo Inarizaki

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.590
Hyougo Inarizaki

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.810
I wonder if they have a strategy where their number ten doesn't jump out.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.470
Or was that just random?

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.770
There was something similar toward the end of the Shiratorizawa match too.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.360
Seriously, how many times do I need to say this?

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.820
If you get distracted by their number ten, you're falling right for their trap.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:17.490
There's a time to be adaptable, and a time to stand your ground.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.780
Don't forget the difference.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.450
Read blocking starts to shine in the latter half of a match.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.990
Right!

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:37.550
Damn!

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.510
Aran!

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.010
Three blockers!

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.560
Yes!

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.680
Crap.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.020
Did that just go above our triple block?

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.190
You can hit like that any time, Asahi!

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.480
Yeah, no. I'm not getting over them like that.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.160
Inarizaki Karasuno Give us a good serve!

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.080
Stop him... You gotta stop him!

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.130
Damn it!

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.840
What a monstrous serve!

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.090
Getting the ball up was all they could do.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.260
Left!

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.300
Asahi!

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:21.890
That was actually okay!

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.010
I actually pulled off an okay emergency set!

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.850
Yeah, that was just luck.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.220
Three blockers!

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.440
Damn it!

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.070
What the hell?!

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.700
Yes!

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.620
Yeah, sorry about that.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.830
They got this far and they're still trying new things?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.370
Those damn crows.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.920
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.460
I finally get to play in the back row for once!

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.130
All right!

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.220
Yes! Yeah!

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.720
Hinata's even more hyped up about serving than he usually is.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:10.140
Yes! Yes! Yeah!

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.600
Even though his serves suck.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.140
I think he's more excited about playing defense than serving.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.600
Yeah! Yes!

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.060
Oh, and Yamaguchi's serving.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.400
Okay, you know what to do.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.280
Make sure you score ten points!

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.320
Why are you all teary-eyed?

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.870
Go. You've got this.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.990
I can't really describe it, but I think we've got this!

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.540
Follow my process, step-by-step.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.090
The way I walk.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.050
The way I touch the ball.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.380
My target is their ace.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.890
The goal is to get him to drop to one knee.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.350
I need to reset, just like I did in the Tsubakihara match.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.230
Wait.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.440
I could see it during warmups.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.190
Calm down.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.280
Just find something else.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.070
Nice spike!
Do it again!

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.250
Concentrate.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.420
You did just fine yesterday.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.880
I need to reset.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.670
Tadashi!

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.390
Tadashi!

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.080
All right!
That's a service ace!

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.790
Oh, sorry about that.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.000
Karasuno takes the lead!

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.260
Hell yeah!

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.880
Oh man...

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.730
Do it again!

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:21.980


00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:28.780
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:35.540
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:52.220
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:58.730
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:04.730
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:10.740
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.450
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:22.290
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:28.300
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:34.050
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:40.230
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990
