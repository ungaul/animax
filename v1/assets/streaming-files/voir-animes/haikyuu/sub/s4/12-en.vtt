Eiwa Fukurodani Okay, do it again!

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.000
Wait, it's too early for that.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.330
I think things are going pretty well.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.760
That Bokuto guy's not a big deal at all.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.530
It's not like he's gotten blocked yet today,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.190
and it's not like anything else should've set him off.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.690
What's causing this?

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.160
Hey, what's wrong?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.860
Cheer up already.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.090
I...

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.360
I wanted to play in the main arena too!

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.580
Bokuto's weakness number 6... He wants to stand out.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.590
It's way bigger over there, and there are more people.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.200

Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.500
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.380

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.380

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.810

You didn't notice?

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.700
I didn't notice them for a while either.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.340
Crap, I didn't notice at all.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.410

Wait, did I gain weight?!

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.440
No, I mean you're bigger in general.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.350
Hello, Kurokawa!

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.280
I guess he's an alumnus.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.240
Oh! So he's our seniors' senior!

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.940
Hinata! Yamaguchi!

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.780
Kageyama and Tsukishima, you guys come over here too.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.870
Let me introduce you.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.280
This is Tashiro, who was the captain when I was a first-year.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.610
And this is Kurokawa, who was our captain when I was a second-year.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.580
Hello!

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.340
Hello.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.550
Whoa!

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.240
Are they really first-years?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.220
Sadly.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.490
We should have some lunchboxes, so go ask Shimizu about them and hand them out to everyone.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.700
Right!

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.660
Who are that first-year setter and that tiny middle blocker?

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.950
Kageyama, the setter, is an amazing kid that's also a candidate for the All-Japan team.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.300
The tiny one... Er, I don't know what to say.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.430
He's an energetic brat.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.290
An athletic monster.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.950
What about when he was in junior high?

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.920
He was totally an unknown.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.680
And sometimes, he's like a completely unknown force,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.500
I guess you'd say.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.650
He picked a fight with Shiratorizawa's Ushiwaka.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.760
Seriously?! With the Ushiwaka?!

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.360
An unknown force...

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.630
I'm pretty sure that's what the other schools think of Karasuno right now.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.030
Make sure you win the next match too.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.990
Right!

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.470
I wanted to be the one who told them to win.

They're good.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.550
But I mean, there's basically no team here who doesn't have someone amazing.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.970
Nice receive!

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.650

Oh man, this is rough.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.470
It's exhausting.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.790
You're empathizing way too much with Kiyokawa's ace.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.700
Those are some nice receives.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.700
Out!

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.240
It was!

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.670
There was nowhere he could go with that.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.420
I touched it!

That's Karasuno's setter.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.630
Man, he looks intense.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.050
He sure projects an intimidating aura.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.600

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.720
I wanted to play in the main arena too!

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.790
The main arena's bigger!

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.370
We let our guard down.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.790
Last year at the tournament, we played in the 8th match of the day,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.910
and the match before us was running longer than scheduled, so we started after 7 PM.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.440
There were barely any players or audience left.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.390
It was insanely hard to keep Bokuto motivated!

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.900
It's sorta cold.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.530
But we're playing in the middle of the day this time, so we thought he'd be okay!

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.390
Why are you like this?

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.160
Why do you let this crap bother you?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.290
Not to mention, you knew this would happen since yesterday!

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.630
Are you really going to let the court decide how you play?

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.910
Well, whatever.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.630
He'll get into it eventually.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.720
This happens all the time.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.770
Whatever.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.970
It's not like Bokuto's always on point anyway.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.070
You say the best things.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.080
Say more!

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.520
Bokuto sure loses motivation fast.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.090
I mean, he's actually being serious right now.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:20.190
Then again, I don't think Bokuto could understand not being able to do your best due to nerves or pressure.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.530
He'll be fine.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.460
Because we're the better team.

Though their ace, Bokuto Koutarou, hasn't gotten many hits through yet.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.870
Eiwa High School was the most cautious about Bokuto,

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.950
so they may be a bit confused right now.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.660

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.040

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.130
Bokuto's starting to get restless.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.230
Any second now...

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.530
Bokuto.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.700
This is basically center court.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.810
The main arena is definitely bigger and has more people,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.510
but only about a quarter of those people would actually be watching you.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.520
However, the only ones competing here are us.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.860
Everyone in here is watching you.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.360
Uh, the number of people watching in the same in either case...

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.950
Just one more push.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.890
And...

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.840
your student has come to see you too!

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.330
Hey, he saw us.

To be honest, I don't exactly know how Bokuto works yet.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.270
Though this may look silly to most, Sorry, get it!

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.510
this is all very important to him.

That shot was right on the line!

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.730
It's because we're in the sub arena... Bokuto!

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.960
Nice spike!

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.930

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.000

Hey, hey, hey!

We're lucky that the short kid from Karasuno showed up at the perfect time.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.390
I'm surprised you found him.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.100
Yeah.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.880
But even if Hinata didn't show up, we just needed to make an opportunity.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.430
Akaashi, you know you can ignore Bokuto sometimes.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.970
Though we might be in trouble if he doesn't get back in his rhythm at times.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.310
I'm only able to draw out a small part of Bokuto's abilities.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:57.780
And watching Bokuto when he's on top of his game is really satisfying.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.940
Why not just tell him that to his face?

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.510
No, no! Then he'll never shut up!

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.080

No...

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.240
but if I look away, I lose!

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.400
Oh, Hoshiumi. Hi.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.940
Oh, hey, Kageyama.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:24.930
How'd your match go?
We won.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.650
Oh, congrats.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:28.870
Thanks.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.080
Do you know him, Kageyama?

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.630
We were at the youth camp together.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.910
This is Hoshiumi.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.710
Youth camp!

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.460
So they're on your team.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.170
Yep.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.290
What position do you play?

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.470
Middle blocker.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.080
How tall are you?

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.050
A hundred and sixty...

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.020
five cm!

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.150
He added a centimeter.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.860
What's your running vertical?

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.730
333 cm!

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.970
I win!

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.660
Kourai, what are you doing?

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.510
The match before ours is almost over.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.980
Well, see ya, Kageyama.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:13.950
Sure.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.970
Make sure I don't get yelled at too.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.170
m 132 -181.5 l 126 186 -106.5 187.5 -117 105 -115.5 55.5 -93 -196.5 85.5 -205.5
He who laughs in the face of grit will be made to cry by grit.
I didn't want the "Grit and Laughter" T-shirt to sell out.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.770
Don't worry.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.890
I'm pretty sure it's not that in demand.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.260
Why wouldn't it be?!

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.100
Welcome back. Where's Mr. Ukai?

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:38.060
Takatani First Takatani First Sentoku
Sentoku Nobusawa Girls'
Nobusawa Girls'
Kamomedai Kamomedai Sannomiya Tech
Sannomiya Tech Chikuida Chikuida
Matsuyama West Business Yukawa Girls'
Yukawa Girls'
Yamato Girls'
He's still talking to some of the previous Coach Ukai's acquaintances.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.760
How have the matches been?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.550
That number five guy from Kamomedai is really amazing.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.780
Oh, here he is.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.870
Hoshiumi Kourai. 169 cm.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:49.700
Left, left!

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.540
Whoa! He hit that above the block!

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.240
He's supposed to be amazing, right?

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.000
Was he in one of the magazines?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.300
Nah. Apparently, he absolutely hates interviews.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:14.320
Really? I'd be super excited to even do an interview for the school paper.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.640
Where are you going?

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.650
I want to watch from closer!

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.090
Kourai!

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.740
Shut down! Look at that block!

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.760
That was Hoshiumi again, wasn't it?

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.700
Indeed, it was.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.940
Again?

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.790
Wow...

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.470
Dang, he can do anything.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.460
Who the heck is their number five?

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.600
Service ace!

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.060
Hoshiumi does it again!

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.460
He can't be stopped!

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.610
The one-man army is on a roll!

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:13.390
He truly is... a Little Giant!

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.870
Wow...

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.650
Hinata's never faltered against two-meter-tall opponents,

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:36.780
but I wonder if it's more shocking for him to see someone in a similar situation who surpasses him.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:38.990
That just popped up in my head.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.480
Kamomedai Chikuida

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.440
Hoshiumi!

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.560
You were amazing out there! Congratulations!

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.410
Thank you.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.400
Your opponents had an average height of over 180 cm!

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.620
They were all way taller than you!

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.850
How did that make you feel?

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.770
Uh-oh. Not good.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:07.580
Huh?

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:14.050
Kourai hates it when someone mentions how small he is or says, "Even though you're so tiny..."

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.760
For as long as I can remember, whenever he made a play way better than the others,

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.820
he'd always get told, "You're so amazing even though you're so small!"

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.670
So he'd just say, "I'm just amazing, period."

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:29.110
Compared to the rest of the world, being over 180 cm isn't really that big of a deal.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.230
Huh? The world?

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.150
Are you paying attention to me because I'm small?

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.660
Uh... U-Um...

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:46.330
But the thing Kourai hates the most is to be told, "You lost because you're so small."

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:52.510
Everyone thinks that being small is more detrimental than it actually is.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.360
Even though being smaller puts you at a disadvantage in volleyball,

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.270
it doesn't make you completely helpless!

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.410
Okay, we're done.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.270
Sorry about that.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.650
He likes to rant.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.880
What?!

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.540
She was trying to give you an honest compliment.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.000
You said yourself that your height puts you at a disadvantage.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.560
Of course it means you're amazing if you can still play this well, then.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.830
You're too self-conscious.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.430
Could you not be so blunt about it?!

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:41.560
Go on.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.020
Apologize to the nice lady.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.850
I'm sorry.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.430
It's fine...

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.280
Oh, he's back.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.640
Hinata, Mr. Ukai's back, so we're taking off.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.340
I'm...

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.520
so happy I made it here!

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.720
Guess I was worried for nothing.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.980
Everyone's just so...

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.220
I can learn a lot from you.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.350
You all need to act more freaked out!

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.250
Hey there, now...

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.760
Looks like we've got us some country bumpkin crows.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.580
Good for you.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.050
You came all this way and you don't have to go back immediately.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.510
We didn't travel that far.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.160
Well, try to survive tomorrow too.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.720
Right back at you.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.460
As soon as both Kuroo and Sawamura turned around, they stopped smiling.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:33.620
I was reminded just how difficult it was going to be...

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.150
to survive day two.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.800
Spring tournament day one: 40 teams eliminated

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:45.010


00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:04.060
So what if the pressure's on?

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.290
I don't need any help from on high

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.360
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:19.450
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.850
I'll take on every challenge

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.180
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:30.560
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.380
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.650
Turned them into conviction

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:43.110
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:47.730
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:52.580
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.900
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:03.510
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:08.220
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.650
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.020


00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:18.520
Huh?

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.480
Niiyama Girls' High School

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.870
They're from Niiyama Girls'.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.680
So they're at the hotel next door.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.230
That difference, though...

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.200
They're seeded, right?

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.050
I mean, they won the interhigh.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.140
Maybe they just finished their practice.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.790
They really are royalty.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.290
And their food must be...

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.290
a luxury all-you-can-eat buffet!

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:49.420
But I love how crispy they fry up all the salmon here!

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.990
And I really like their rolled omelets.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.600
Nothing beats the unlimited refills on the rice!

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.780
True!
Ryuu!

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.440
I heard that Karasuno won.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.800
Congrats!

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.200
Th-Thanks.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.140
Um... So...

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.820
Let's both do our best tomorrow!

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.010
Y-Yeah...

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.600
Okay, see you later!

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.750
Yeah...

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.300
You've definitely got a chance.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.630
Damn you!

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.880
I was trying not to notice!

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.570
I mean, it's not even just a chance.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.010
I thought this at the opening ceremony, but I'm pretty sure she likes you.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.060
Stop!

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.330
I... have a chance?

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990
