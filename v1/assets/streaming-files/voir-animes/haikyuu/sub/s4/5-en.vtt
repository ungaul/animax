WEBVTT

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.510
We're not following you anymore.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.150
Are you really giving Shorty the kind of set he wants?

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.430
Have you even tried to?

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.430
If you can't understand that, you've basically regressed back to being a dictator.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.740
Is something up with Kageyama today?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.370
You mean physically?

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.720
No, I can't think of anything.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.000
Come to think of it, when Kageyama was in junior high,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.400
he caused a buzz with a headline like, "A Promising Setter Prodigy in Miyagi Prefecture!"

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.690
I thought he'd fulfill that promise in his third year of junior high,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.770
but I didn't hear about him at all.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.520
"Prodigy," huh?

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.700
I'm not sure what the actual definition for prodigy is,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.670
but I personally think they're the furthest away from perfect.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.720
That's what makes them interesting, though.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.810
But on the court...

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.540
you're a Goody Two-Shoes, aren't ya?

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.970


00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.270
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.890
Now, go bask in the orange glow

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.240
!
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !
Haikyuu

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.370
Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.500
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.380
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.390
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.100
If a person tries to live their life swallowing their dreams and passions

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.820
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.860
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.780
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.960
Awaits a land Of thrilling competition

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.320
Unleash everything you've got

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.670
Winning or losing doesn't even seem to matter

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.840
When you're in the zone and everything flows

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.460
In glorious slow-motion Now, go all-out!

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.020


00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.560
Shiratorizawa Academy Episode Five: Hunger
Episode Five: Hunger Episode Five: Hunger

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.110
Here's our chance to score!

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.120
He's doing... a fake set!

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.040
I was right!

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.020
Not so fast!

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.760
He actually predicted that!

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.300
Finish it off!

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.010
The set was too low and sloppy!

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.200
Sorry.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.390
I know I suck at overhand passes.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.110
Watching Tsukishima get yelled at is new.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.570
There are only two of you on the court.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.530
There's no one to cover for your mistakes.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.670
They should aim for Hyakuzawa when they hit it back over.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.530
He's easier to break than Kunimi.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.160
But if Hyakuzawa is the one who gets the first touch,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.560
he's going to be the one who gets the last hit.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.420
If he can get a high set, he'll probably hit it over.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.340
He's really good at hitting high sets.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.100
He doesn't seem that great at defense, but he's got plenty of stamina.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.390
And he's got a long reach,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.810
so even when you think you're getting a hit in...

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.630
he'll get a hand on it.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.840
Let's take it easy, Hyakuzawa!

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.530
Thanks to Hinata, he really is getting relaxed.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.990
Finish it off!

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.410
That's definitely not an easy ball to hit.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.460
Should I step back rather than trying to jump for a block?

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.230
No, but Hyakuzawa's...

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.630
gonna go for that spike!

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.430
I touched it!

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.440
Nice contact!

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.350
Nice backup!

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.980
Crap. It might've drifted.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.440
That's fine. That's plenty.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.570
Hell yeah!

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.070
Nice spike!

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.910
Tsukishima... nice set...

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.710
What's with your face, then?

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.410
After seeing you actually do some serious setting, I got super hyped, but super frustrated as well.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.880
Well, thank you for being so detailed and honest.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.840
It wasn't even that good.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.300
I...

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.660
I also need to be able to do everything.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.730
All right, then...

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.730
Because Coach Saitou from Shiratorizawa Academy is, er... not feeling well,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.790
we'll be doing a joint practice match.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.440
What's wrong with Coach Saitou?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.080
He ate some bad oysters.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:59.170
And so, the third-years and alumni from Shiratorizawa will be playing against you again.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.670
Today's the last day of your five-day camp.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.170
Do your best to make this match a better one than last time.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.770
Whoa!

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.520
All of Shiratorizawa!

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.390
Chances like this don't come often!

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.550
Don't you agree, Kunimi?!

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.020
That's what you think on the inside, right?

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.740
Let's do our best!

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.520
Yeah!

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.310
By the way, Karasuno's number ten was a ball boy the last time we came by too.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.620
Why isn't he playing?

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.830
Oh, well...

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.560
It's sort of a long story.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.290
First off, he wasn't actually invited to this training camp.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.190
Huh?

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.550
What's that supposed to mean?

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.180
Got it!

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.150
Ushijima!

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.610
Can I ask you a question?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.960
Hinata's actually talking to Ushiwaka.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.550
He sure has guts.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.290
You're from the same school.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.240
Huh?

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.790
I mean, he's hard for us to approach as well.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.000
When you're receiving the ball, what are you thinking about?

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.760
Are you sure you don't need to ask Ushijima for advice?

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.930
Who knows when he'll be by next?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.970
I-I...

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.430
I don't know about asking my rival for help...

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:46.900
Rival? What are you talking about? You should probably get rid of that unnecessary pride

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.400
This is why you're second best, you bowl-cut brat

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.400
You don't have to lecture him that hard with your eyes.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.410
If anything, in the matter of taking initiative,

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.080
you're definitely one step behind Karasuno's number ten.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.800
U-Ushijima!

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.680
It's a tip!

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.520
Got it!
Nice!

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.850
Not only did he dig out the ball,

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.950
he's conscientious enough to move so the back row attacker can approach.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.450
Kageyama!

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.330
Nice spike!

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.730
Yes.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.610
Yeah!

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.970
Kageyama's doing great as a left wing spiker, and Hoshiumi's a great setter.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.630
Yeah, he can play any position.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.140
I'm on a roll.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.050
Everyone's so good that I feel like I'm rising to their level.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.960
Nice!

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.570
Man, that was good.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200
Nice location!

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.920
Hey! You just doubted my set, didn't you?

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.520
I just took a second to make sure.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.040
Hoshiumi really is a great all-rounder.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.690
This is their time of discovery.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.510
We don't know what kind of potential we'll see from them,

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.830
and we don't know what the players themselves will realize.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:26.190
In the end, they're talented enough that they're going to have to produce results eventually.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.480
But despite being in a high-pressure situation,

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.780
I want them to enjoy volleyball.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.970
"Take your time" might just sound like really run-of-the-mill advice,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.260
but I mean...

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.300
Taking your time really is important.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.920
Miya!

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.630
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.960
All righty, then...

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.710
Here you go.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.940
Yes!

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.140
Nice spike!

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.600
Really good setters can even bewitch their spikers.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.120
They can make them think that they've suddenly gotten better and stronger than before.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.980
We've got a great crop of setters this year.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.780
I hope the spikers who've been hitting the balls Kageyama and Atsumu have been setting

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.910
suddenly get confused when they go back to their teams.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:42.010
Haikyuu!!

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.000


00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.070
Hisashi, nice serve!

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.150
Kinoshita's gotten better at jump float serves.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.030
I'm not gonna lose!

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.340
It's a bit long, but I can definitely see the movement!

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.130
Right!

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.290
Noya, here I go!

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.690
All right! Bring it!

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:20.840
Ukai!

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.340
Sir! How'd it go?

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.110
They seem okay with the idea.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.040
We just have to get our schedules together.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.350
I see.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.920
We've got less than a month until the spring tournament,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.310
so I want to get in as many matches as we can when our full lineup's back.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.210
And against the toughest opponents possible.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:41.850
Right.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.620
Well, the other players should be coming back tomorrow.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.910
Well? How did being a spiker feel?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.750
It was fun.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.470
Your sets were really easy to hit.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.750
Right?

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.670
Anyone who can't hit my sets just sucks.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.900
Maybe you're better off being a spiker rather than a setter, Tobio.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.320
Why do you think that?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.100
Your face is really tense when you're setting.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.970
I'm pretty sure that's because you called him a Goody Two-Shoes.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.510
But you looked like you had a lot of fun playing a wing spiker.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.820
I see.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.840
I'm a setter, though.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.320
Yeah, I figured as much.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.040
Um, Miya...

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.340
What'd you mean by "Goody Two-Shoes"?

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.830
Exactly what it sounds like.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.000
You're serious, honest, and an all-around good kid.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.100
Great job training at a training camp in an unfamiliar gym with players you aren't used to.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:01.190
I know this was to get you started on your youth team activities, so there was a lot of fumbling around.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:07.070
But I hope you don't think of the practice you've done here as different from what you'll be doing when you get back.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.300
It'll be great if we can all improve.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.910
Let's all keep doing our best.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.370
Public Interest Incorporated Foundation

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.190
Japan Volleyball Association That's all.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.370
Thank you very much!

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.700
Tobio, see you again at the spring tournament.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.300
Yeah.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.880
See ya.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.060
See you soon, Kageyama.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.780
Do your best at the spring tournament.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.530
Yeah.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.240
Which way is the station?

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.590
I'll just go with you.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:06.170
Shiratorizawa Academy

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.170
Yeah! I get to practice for real again tomorrow!

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.600
I'm gonna hit so many balls!

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.050
Ugh...

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.000
I just finished my training camp, and I have to go straight back to practice tomorrow?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.530
What the heck are you talking about?

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.680
There's less than a month until the spring tournament.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.260
What?

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.650
Taking breaks is a part of our training too... Hey!

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.970
Tsukki! Let's exchange email addresses!

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:28.520
Huh?

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.310
Hey, Goshiki!

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.980
I need your email address!

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.320
Email address?

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.790
You were the only two I didn't have!

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.680
Okay, I'll send you mine, so make sure you add me!

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.710
Hey.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.650
Never mind.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:50.700
See ya.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.630
What the heck?

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.270
Is...

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.600
Is Kageyama doing well?

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.980
Sure. As long as it isn't finals week.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.260
I see.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.100
Why?

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.260
It's just...

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.880
It seems like his playstyle has changed.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.570
You worry too much about your time in junior high.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.830
You did your best, didn't you?

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.080
Whatever.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.630
We were just having a casual conversation.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.980
It terrifies me.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.420
You mean the thing about no one hitting Kageyama's sets?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.180
But fighting is totally normal.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.180
Fighting?

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.650
Not being able to back down and fighting is normal!

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.850
So Kageyama's totally fine!

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.570
Who even cares about Kageyama?

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.570
H-Hey!

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.950
We're gonna crush you guys in our next official match.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.300
What?!

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.330
We're not gonna lose!

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.390
Hey!

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.700
See ya.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.210
Yeah!

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.150
Coach Washijou, thank you for everything.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.230
What did you think?

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.270
The two-on-two was a good idea.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.650
You think so?

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.920
So Karasuno's number ten never got to practice?

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.440
Yep. Ball boy until the end.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.830
Seriously?

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.800
That said, he was definitely the most fired up,

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.720
and the other boys were definitely influenced by that.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.430
A powerful, driving hunger for height...

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.130
Whether you realize it or not,

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.750
and whether it's something positive or something negative,

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.690
that hunger is always there for us.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.740
Those who are lacking in size...

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.700
have that hunger instead.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.410
I'm starving!

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.920
Thanks for waiting! Here are your oysters!

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.710
They've got the best oysters here!

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.560
Shochu with hot water.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.610
Coming right up!

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:58.240
Miyagi Prefectural Karasuno High School

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.030
Hell yeah!

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.800
Boys' Volleyball Team

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.220
Hey.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.920
What were you doing for the last five days?

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.610
I was a ball boy.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.790
Hey, do you have the key to the clubroom or the gym?

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.260
No.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.530
But yeah, the best player there was Goshiki.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.840
Oh, but Kunimi... And Hyakuzawa...

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.820
The guy who's two meters tall. He was super huge.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.360
What about you?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.020
Meet any awesome players?

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.070
Yeah.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.910
I'd hope so.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.530
I'm sure lots of them would end up in Monthly Volleyball.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.990
There was a Little Giant there too.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.500
He was 170 cm tall, give or take.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.020
I've never seen him in Monthly Volleyball,

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:24.590
but without a doubt, he was one of the best players even out of all the amazing players there.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.760
He was about a hundred times better than you.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.210
Did you really have to tack that on?!

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.950
Couldn't you have just ended it with "he was one of the best players there"?!

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.500
Did you really need to say that last thing?! I think not!

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.350
Hey, I figured you'd be here.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:45.140
Y'know, you didn't have to start fighting the moment you saw each other again.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.250
Hi!

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.140
What do you guys even have to fight about?

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.450
You sure are impressive.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.060
Hey.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.040
You can fly even higher.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:06.920
Futakuchi!

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.890
Yes, sir!

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.220
We just confirmed a practice match for next week, so be ready for it.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.680
Who are we playing?

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.560
Karasuno.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:16.990
Huh?

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.040


00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.040
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:46.270
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.340
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.430
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.830
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.160
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:07.530
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.360
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.620
Turned them into conviction

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:20.080
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.710
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.560
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.880
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.480
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.190
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:50.630
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990
