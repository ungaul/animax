WEBVTT

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.270
Samu!

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.660
Aran!

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.340
A block that's not scary isn't actually a block.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.560
This guy's way scarier than Four-eyes over there.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.020


00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.820
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.040
Haikyuu !
!
Haikyuu

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.290
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.170
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.550
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.840
'Cause if we give up now It'll all be over

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.330
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.860
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.530
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.470
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.110
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.620
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.300
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.220
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.220
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.750
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.620
So let's start smiling

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.980


00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.030
Episode Twenty-one: Hero Episode Twenty-one: Hero
Episode Twenty-one: Hero Aran!

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.400
Got it!

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.950
I didn't hit it very hard.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.380
Time to score!

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.840
The ball is back in Inarizaki's court!

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.790
Look! Inarizaki's number ten is going for it!

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.710
You've got this, Karasuno full-of-holes blocker guy!

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.670
This is Suna Rintarou's fast attack.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.450
How can he keep his upper body that still?

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.200
I mean, even if we fully understand what's going on here, it's going to be totally different during the match.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.560
Man, nationals is scary.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.750
When a spike is about to happen, it's not just a one-on-one with the spiker and blocker.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.560
Even with two blockers, it's not one-on-two.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.810
It's always one-on-six.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.780
There's always a way to fight.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.680
I guess you don't need to hear that.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.080
I'm always going to try to stop it, of course.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.230
But it's not like I'm going to be able to suddenly beat a middle blocker that's been to nationals.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.630
But if it's one-on-six...

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.370
But if it's one-on-six...

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.440
Yeah.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.030
The idea that the only good block is a kill block is outdated.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.410
Yes!

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.330
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.040
It's probably a good thing they didn't get frantic.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.820
If they'd rushed after the ball, he would've probably used that against them.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.210
It's not like they can block his entire range.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.340
If they ever tried to fully stop him one-on-one, they'd be playing into his hands.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.880
And even though I understand all of this, I know I'd get impatient and go for the block.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.500
I'm sure I could at least stop some.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.270
But with Tsukki,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.940
I think he's using the first two sets to tell the guys in the back row,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.940
"This is Suna Rintarou's cross-body spike."

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.190
Volleyball's a sport where you know you're gonna get scored on.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.750
It's impossible to ever have a shutout.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.150
There's no way to defeat any attack.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.500
But when it comes to Suna's cross-body spike,

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.210
the more he decides to use it, the more Tsukki and Karasuno have an advantage.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.800
Are you telling me he's only been blocking my cross-court spikes on purpose?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.430
Hey, thanks for letting me get a clean hit in every time.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.980
And thank you for hitting exactly how I expected you would every single time.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.240
So it was deliberate!

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.780
He has to be the least assertive middle blocker I've ever seen.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.750
Is he a robot?

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.080
I guess it's no shock that Karasuno has more than surprise attacks.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.710
Things sure are getting interesting.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.380
Kinoshita.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.800
Kinoshita!

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.600
Go score ten points!

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.560
This is my last chance in this match.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.930
Good luck.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.860
Get a nice serve in, Kinoshita!

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.450
This is my 28th mental service ace.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.250
I'm pretty sure Kinoshita didn't hear that.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.710
He's not hearing the other team, nor is he hearing us.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.890
All of his attention is on the ball, the tape, and where he's aiming!

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.870
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.970
Yes!

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.330
Nice spike!

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.970
After seeing those insane first-years, I got super excited.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.930
But I also realized they were completely different beings than me.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.890
Even so, Yamaguchi worked his way up to being a hero.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.650
So did Tanaka.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.690
Ennoshita got subbed in at some critical moments and did his job.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.970
As did Narita.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.730
Even if I could never be like Nishinoya or Kageyama,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.210
I thought I could have an epic moment out on the court.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.430
Even if it was just for a second, I thought I could be a hero.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.220
I guess I was wrong, though.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.480
Sorry about that.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.390
Kinoshita, that was a great serve!

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.980
You hit it in a good spot.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.430
Hey!

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.920
You'll have more chances to kill it out there.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.670
Today's not your last shot!

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.090
R-Right.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.160
It might be the third-years' last shot, though.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.560
And yet, I haven't done a damn thing.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.830
Yeah!

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.790
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.760
Kageyama, give us a good serve!

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.890
It barely goes over!

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.310
Kageyama Tobio's something else!

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.960
They're really going on the offensive now.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.930
This ain't good.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.350
Yeah! Yes!

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.790
Two more rotations and Miya Atsumu will be serving again.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.740
Make sure you get in whatever you can right now!

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.950
Fly Fly

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.410
So when I was really little, I was a big scaredy-cat.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.740
I'm not sure exactly, but I think it lasted until I started grade school.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.150
I was scared of bugs.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.340
I was scared of birds.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.590
I was scared of tricycles.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.210
I was scared of ghosts.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.560
I think I was pretty shy too.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.270
So, uh...

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.050
Are you talking about a previous life?

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.730
I told you, this is when I was a kid!

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:08.520
But my gramps was pretty intense when it came to discipline, so I got over it pretty fast.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.450
Oh yeah! Your gramps is pretty intense!

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.610
Hello!

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.890
Th-Thanks for having me over.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.410
I met him twice, and he had a different hottie with him each time.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.240
It's rare for Nishinoya to be this talkative during a match.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.030
Is it because he's nervous?

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.230
When Miya Atsumu served,

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.050
my feet were glued to the ground, but it sorta felt nostalgic.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.160
The fact that I felt scared, I mean.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.310
It's amazing that you can actually admit you're scared.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.620
What does he mean, that feeling scared was nostalgic?

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.850
Who knows?

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.850
It's not like us plebs would understand.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.240
But my gramps would always say...

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.040
that it's a waste of time to be scared.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.900
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.870
Looks like that bastard's back.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.480
It's good. Eat it.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:15.590
Acknowledging that you actually dislike something that you thought you disliked.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.850
Don't go in from above!

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.380
And stop staring at the pup's eyes!

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.850
There's always a reason for hostility.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.730
My feet won't reach!

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.980
If you can get on a bicycle, see how far you can go.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.250
It's such a waste to pass up the opportunity to learn something new.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.430
But what if...

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.330
you're really scared?

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.540
Well, what else?

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.840
Have someone help you!

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.550
Bring it on!

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.530
I'm gonna knock off... those tiny hands of yours!

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.980
You know, Nishinoya...

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.990
I'm pretty sure you could get by with just underhand receives instead of forcing yourself to do overhand ones.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:24.010
I mean, I'd like to just do underhand receives, and I thought I could pull that off.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.920
But there are people better than me.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.410
It's no fun if you don't try other options once you know they exist.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.590
Nishinoya!

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.800
Move up!

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.980
Nice receive!

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.580
Yeah!

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.540
Yes!

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.900
Nice spike!

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.000
Yes...

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.450
Yes!

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.170
Inarizaki Karasuno
Karasuno managed to limit Miya Atsumu to one serve!

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.630
Yeah!

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.440
Yeah!

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.990
Yeah!

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:58.010
Haikyuu!!

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.000


00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.470
Former Japan National Team Setter Mr. Inuhata Masahiko
Mr. Inuhata Masahiko Junior Volleyball Classes
Junior Volleyball Classes Junior Volleyball Classes

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.850
He's huge.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.930
He sure is.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.890
Apparently his name is Aran, and he's in fifth grade.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.530
Man, how cool.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.850
I'm jealous.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.960
He's got a foreign name!

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.190
Seriously?

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.730
Maybe I'll change my name.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.160
I'm pretty sure if you just change your name, Grams is gonna be sad.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160
Yeah... Morons.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.670
Samu... Osamu, so Samu!

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.680
Then I guess you'll be Tsumu.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.150
Nah, Tsumu is weird, dude.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.830
Man, that's just too cool!

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.870
How's that?!

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.250
Heya, I'm Inuhata.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.150
I'm so happy y'all showed up today.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.150
The Miya Twins.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.720
I knew them before they got so famous.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.020
Aw, he's a setter? Too bad he's not a spiker.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.880
Dang, they're rude.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.580
Hey, you think Giba would show up?

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.940
Like hell, moron.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.960
You're so stupid, Tsumu.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.470
Setter's the super-cool position only the best players play.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.900
So you wanna play setter, Samu?

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.920
No, I wanna spike.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.750
What was your point, then?

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.450
Hey, nice spike. Pretty impressive.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.940
Dude! I hit it, like, perfectly!

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.870
Yeah!

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.800
Don't be scared. Come on over!

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.840
I'll help you get the ball over.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.520
Yeah, nice one!

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:34.480
I'll help you.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.520
Setters...

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.840
are pretty cool!

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.200
Hey!

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.330
It's Aran.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.390
Heya.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.080
Hey, twins.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:57.000
I'd say the twins were powerful rather than skilled, and they were super competitive.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.480
If I had to choose, Osamu was a bit better than Atsumu,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.220
which meant that Atsumu was always challenging Osamu.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.100
Osamu, try playing setter.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.100
Only the best players get to be the setter, so we all saw this comin'.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.730
Osamu and Atsumu both hated losing.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:39.210
But it seemed like Atsumu had something that went beyond just hating to lose.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.990
Uh, so, we're gonna have Atsumu be the setter today.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.150
Did you know, Tsumu?

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.340
The more positions you play, the better you get.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.560
Shut your mouth and at least be jealous, stupid Samu!

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.360
Atsumu kept getting better at setting every time I saw him.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.570
And when he was paired with Osamu, they were perfect.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.250
Eventually, people started fearing the Miya Twins.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.950
Yako Yako I was really on my game today.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.910
The way the ball felt settling on my fingers and when it left my hands was perfect.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.420
I could totally see what their blockers were doing too.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.200
Did you guys have a problem with my sets?

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.690
No... not really.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.350
So why couldn't you score any points?

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.780
The hell's his problem?!

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.550
Well, he's really good. Can you blame him?

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.320
He's just an arrogant jerk!

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.730
Well, we do win when they're both on their game.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.000
Just deal with it.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.950
Tsumu, the other guys don't like you.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.190
So?

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.720
I made up my mind that I'm never going to be like you.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.640
I'm going to be a nice guy.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.100
What are you even talking about?

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.090
I've known the twins ever since I was little,

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.560
but sometimes, Atsumu scared me.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.400
It's exhausting when even your teammates hate you.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.730
Inarizaki High School
Osamu, you were off your game today.

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.430
Well, we all have our off days.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.190
Don't worry about it.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.510
We all suck!

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.620
And that's exactly why we practice!

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.640
Talk about passionate.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.450
You useless piece of trash.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.610
Any piece of trash that can't score with those sets...

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.180
should get the hell off the court.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.260
Atsumu! You don't need to say it like that!

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.770
Osamu already feels bad enough!

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.240
Why, you... Abusive, tyrannical pig!

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.940
You may be on your game, but there are days when we aren't!

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.600
If I'm off my game, that's just what that means, you stupid ass!
H-Hey, you two.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.900
Stop! You're gonna get hurt!
They don't hold back.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.410
Does Wittle Atsumu never make a mistake?!

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.330
What's wrong with calling a piece of trash a piece of a trash?!

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.110
Look in the mirror sometime, dumbass!

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.710
Hey, the Miya Twins are fighting.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.440
A volleyball team classic! The twins are fighting!

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.480
Let's bet our lunches on who's gonna win!

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.730
Wanna play Pro Evo Soccer?

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.770
Yeah.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.000
Slow down, you stupid twins!

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:53.400
The biggest blessing that Atsumu has isn't his physique or his various talents.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.990
It's actually Osamu.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:02.670
No matter how fast they run, if no one else can catch up, they'll always catch up with each other.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.580
I'm sure that can be annoying sometimes.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.860
Come back here, you scrub!

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:17.320
The more they compete with each other, the better they'll get.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.770
Good job getting picked for the All-Japan Youth Camp, Tsumu.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.850
Be more frustrated, Samu!

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.230
I am, dumbass.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.300
I'm frustrated at the fact that I'm not more frustrated.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.040
You've been working hard.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.630
What the hell?!

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.120
You'd better not be implying that you aren't!

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.850
I'm pretty sure I am.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.920
But I think they just wanted to pick someone who's a bit crazy.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.420
What?!

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.000
Our skill is equal.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.280
No, I'm better than you!

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.880
Hear me out, damn it.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.130
It's just...

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.960
you love volleyball a smidge more than I do, Tsumu.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.270
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.250
It's not dropping!

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.320
Help!

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.900
Time to score!
Fly Fly

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.330
Damn it, it's low!

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:25.330
Sorry! Someone get it!

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.350
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.010
I wonder how many people in the crowd actually noticed just how amazing that set was.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:00.050
Typically in that situation, you'd do an underhand set high and to the left.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.760
Nice!

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.950
So this is an All-Japan Youth Camp setter's skill.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:10.170
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.170
I'm always amazed you can pull off that set.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.150
You could just go underhand.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.130
Well, it's a setter's job to set.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.660
I have to set the ball to the best spot.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.590
And?

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.100
Underhanded, it would've been two arms.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.840
But overhanded, I've got ten fingers.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.690
I went with the higher number for better support.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.170
Because I'm a setter!

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.940
That's Miya Atsumu for you.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:42.050
He may be easily flattered, as well as determined and aggressive,

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.910
but he's more considerate and dedicated to his spikers than anyone else.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.170
He's the ideal setter.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.370
Oh?

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.260
But I can't pull that off.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.670
I couldn't get under a ball that low, especially that fast.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:01.650
I don't have the speed or muscle to stabilize my body under the ball,

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:06.320
or the skills or technique to pull off a perfect set from there.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.150
Maybe don't go into such detail about something you can't do.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:15.980
Yeah...

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.490
I'm glad I came here too.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:21.990


00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.880
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:35.630
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.310
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:58.820
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:04.820
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:10.830
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.540
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.380
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:28.390
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:34.140
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:40.310
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990
