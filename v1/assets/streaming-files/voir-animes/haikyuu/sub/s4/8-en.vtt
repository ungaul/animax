Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.690
Here's our chance!

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.170
Jeez... That was one heck of a block.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.340
Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.000
Yeah.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.930
The best thing for you to do...

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.320
...is blend in, right?

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.020


00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.320
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.940
Now, go bask in the orange glow

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.290
!
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !
Haikyuu

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.420
Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.550
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.430
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.440
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:34.150
If a person tries to live their life without getting a taste of their dreams and passions

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.860
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.910
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.830
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:56.010
Awaits a land Of thrilling competition

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.370
Unleash everything you've got

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.720
Winning or losing doesn't even seem to matter

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.890
When you're in the zone and everything flows

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.510
In glorious slow-motion Now, go all-out!

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.980

Episode Eight: Challenger Episode Eight: Challenger

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.480
Episode Eight: Challenger Let's score here!

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.610
Wait.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.230
Their number ten isn't jumping up.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.450
Blend in.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.920
Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.520
Asahi, nice spike!

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.570
All right! A round of diving drills!

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.440
Daichi, we won.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.390
Oh... Force of habit.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.020
They finally managed to win a set.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.850
Yep.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.810
Seal walk!

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.030
It looked like Date Tech hesitated on their last block.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.530
Up until now, whenever Kageyama was the setter,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.160
Hinata wasn't involved with the synchronized attacks.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.590
Because he was attacking one tempo faster.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.000
So everyone else was coming in on a first tempo attack and Hinata was on minus tempo.
Minus Minus Minus Minus

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.410
Everyone is on guard against that super-fast attack.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.430
They'd be on guard as soon as they saw it, and even more so once they know about it.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:30.440
The Iron Wall of Date

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.080
But right now, we're playing against Date Tech.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.330
Even if they were to change up their block formation for strategic purposes,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.440
it's still rare for them to let their opponents confuse them.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.840
The amazing thing about Date Tech is that even when Hinata gets in a super-fast attack,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.040
they're able to move on from it.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.780
Yeah, it doesn't faze them.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.370
Just because Date Tech is really good at blocking, that doesn't mean they're trying to stop everyone.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.790
Even if they can't completely stop an attack, they'll have at least two blockers show up,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.290
and they can at least touch Hinata's super-fast attack.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.000
Even if they can't fully stop an attack, if they can limit its range, their floor defense will probably get it.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.800
And...

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.780
in the second half of the match, Hinata will be exhausted and get completely shut down.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.080
Say what?!

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.370
Karasuno will be completely helpless.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.290
That's Date Tech's ultimate, ideal story!

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.190
Hey, what team are you on?

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.320
The more Hinata scores, the more likely they are to hesitate.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.780
But...

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.640
But we're in the fourth set, and I can't say I'm seeing much hesitation.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.320
They sure are resilient.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.040
And that's exactly why...

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.880
...is blend in, right?

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.280
Yeah.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.260
Sounds good to me.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.910
The first time I saw your fast attack, I thought it was awesome!

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.440
It was love at first sight.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.420
A fast attack that could be done from anywhere.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.530
It meddles with blocks and its speed is terrifying for any blocker.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.280
I thought its speed was almighty.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.990
But...

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:15.830
against skilled read blocking, all that speed means is that you just get removed from the list of possible attackers.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.120
Hinata's used his speed as a weapon more than anyone else,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.510
yet he managed to bring this up on his own.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.260
Just because it's effective, that doesn't mean a player will automatically want to do it.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.190
There's no guarantee the weapon that worked first will continue working until the end.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.780
I have to keep moving forward.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.420
I have to keep going!

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.730
My greatest weapon is not getting caught!

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.760
If they adjust to me, I just have to adjust in turn.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.740
Whoever stops adjusting won't be able to continue forward!

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.370
I touched it!
Nishinoya!

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.080
Got it!

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.050
I knew it. Hinata's not jumping out first.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.840
I'm still here.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.010
I'm not going anywhere.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.640
Stay as a viable threat... ...until the very last...

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.040
...moment possible!

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.150
All right!

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.520
Daichi, nice spike!

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.950
Date Tech's blockers are watching Hinata even more.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.860
All right!

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.700
Daichi, nice spike!

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.370
Well, he gave them so much trouble before and just suddenly went quiet.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.350
Concentrate!

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.630
It's not like they're doing something completely new.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.020
Correct. Tsukishima and Hinata are doing what they always do with our synchronized attacks.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.020
Kogane!
Right!

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.800
But... That's too far, Kogane!

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.880
Sorry!
A tip!

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.500
Sorry, someone get it!

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.360
Kageyama!
Got it!

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.350
This time... it was super fast!

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.990
Minus tempo!

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.150
We never said we wouldn't use it!

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.180
Kogane froze up!

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.580
I totally know how that feels, Koganegawa!

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.910
You know,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.830
using the super-fast attack after having him blend in is quite effective.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.890
With read blocking, you're following where the ball goes up,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.550
but the ball's not the only thing you're following.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.800
The ball's position after the receive.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.930
Where the spikers who are about to attack are.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.780
The setter's location.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.310
Your eyes try to instantaneously gather all the information you need.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.730
That's why we're giving them even more information to process.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:52.700
Minus? 1st?
Minus? 1st?
Minus? 1st?

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.620
Hinata's great at increasing that kind of information.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:52.700
A Quick?
A Quick?
A Quick?

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:52.700
B Quick?
B Quick?
B Quick?

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.970
He's insanely annoying to the opponents.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.700
Back row attack? C Quick?
Back row attack? C Quick?
Back row attack? C Quick?
Where's he coming from? When will he make his move?

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.700
Broad jump?
Broad jump?
Broad jump?

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.440
Not to mention, our talented setter is skilled enough that he's not going to give anything away.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.920
Thanks to him, Hinata is able to attack from anywhere at any time.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.880
And after blending into all that information...

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.840
the minus tempo attack suddenly bears its fangs.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.770
U-Um...

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.270
I'm not sure if this is relevant or not, but previously, former Coach Ukai...

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:27.040
That said, Munchkin's minus tempo attack is impressive on its own,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.860
but it's sorta being wasted.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.540
That's what he said.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.770
That damn old fart...

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.280
Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech Yeah!

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.970
They got the super-fast attack in!

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.760
It's not like that one point is going to determine anything.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.250
Huh?

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.100
Because that point just happened,

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.630
Date Tech is going to pay even more attention to Hinata now.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.320
And then it'll make it a little easier to score from the sides.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.720
The more we manage to do that, the more it's going to make their blockers hesitate.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:05.440
And if luck is on our side, their blockers will get impatient and start guess blocking,

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.950
which completely destroys their blocking system.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.690
Karasuno's ultimate, ideal story!

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.240
Don't interrupt, Yamaguchi.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.890
My bad, Tsukki!

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:29.960
Haikyuu!!

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:22.950


00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.250
Don't lose focus.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.280
In terms of time, this is our last set.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.430
Yessir!

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.460
Azumane, even if you're tired, try to maintain good form.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.930
Yes, sir.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.060
Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech Tsukishima!

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.880
I've been setting like I usually do.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.690
Is there a problem—

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.380
Tsukki...

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.150
Looks like Tsukishima's tank's about to be empty for the day.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.330
He even ate lunch too.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.410
Don't compare him to you!

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:12.030
Sorry, but I'm not a machine or a monster like Hinata.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.110
Keep an eye on your teammates' conditions.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.640
Right.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.640
Get under it!
Ryuu!

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:23.140
Left! Left!

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.890
A cross-court spike?

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.760
It's no use!

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.360
I totally suck today!

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.230
Wow, Tanaka's sounding defeated. That's rare!

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.810
But that was a great straight spike.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.070
I totally thought he was going to do a cross-court spike.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.090
Kageyama learned "encouragement"!

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.040
Nah, I don't think that was just encouragement.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.420
I think he was being serious.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.690
You've still got a ways to go, Futakuchi!

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.640
How long are you going to be here?

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.390
Don't worry! We're free all day today!

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.940
Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.570
All right.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.940
Is it me? Is it? It's me, right? Right?

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.040
Right?! Right?! Right?! Right?! Right?!

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.040
Yeah, Yamaguchi definitely has more guts now.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.030
I love it when these guys are ready to get in there.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.040
But...

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.600
Kinoshita!

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.530
You got this, Kinoshita!

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.060
Oba!

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.390
My bad!

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.480
All right!

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.090
We've got to do something about our receiving.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.940
Do it again, Kinoshita!

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.360
It's out!

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.670
Could you not freak out every time you're called on?

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.600
You know, you managed to score a point regardless.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.720
Yes, sir.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.420
The next time you hide from me, I'm making you sit next to me the whole time.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.050
Right... Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.470
Minus tempo!

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.860
Damn, Aone's awesome!

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.320
Got it!

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.910
A first-tempo synchronized attack... Or not?!

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.630
Their number ten?

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.910
Now he ran out?

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.040
This time, I'm gonna stop him!

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.810
Yes.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.570
Nice spike!

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.850
Am I imagining it?

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.600
It looked like he was trying to lure Koganegawa over.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.840
He knew that the blockers would react to the super-fast attack,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.660
and so he acted like he was going to attack again and lured him over.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.340
No, he's completely intent on hitting every time.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.900
That's why it's easy for him lure over the opponent.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.370
Was it just coincidence?

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.750
Was it instinct?

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:45.170
Regardless, I'm the one who chose Azumane, so it was my point.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.340
What?

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.260
Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.340
Asahi! Slam it down!

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.620
The greatest wall in the prefecture...

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.380
His height and strength have gone way up since our last match.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.830
But somehow, I'm not scared.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.240
Azumane!

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.210
Three blockers!

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.750
Get in there!

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.200
Holy crap! Talk about power!

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.900
That's not all.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.620
Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.810
Thank you very much!

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.270
Make sure you take the right balls!

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.250
Right!

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.890
Hey!

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.630
It seems like you practice a lot, but you don't tape up your hands at all.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.510
Don't your fingers hurt?

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.810
I hurt my nails all the time.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.200
I even tape them just in case now.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.930
I strengthen my fingers.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.020
Like finger push-ups and stuff.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.390
It feels off when I tape them, so I try to avoid it.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.620
Especially with my fingertips.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:27.750
If there's anything even 0.1 mm between my fingers and the ball, it doesn't feel right.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.820
That's why I always take perfect care of my fingertips and nails.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.170
Finger training?!

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.870
I'll start today!

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.980
You won't last three days.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.990
What about you, Kanekogawa?

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.620
Close, but it's Koganegawa.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.840
Sorry.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.280
What's your highest reach, Koganegawa?

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.970
Let's see... I think it was 340 cm.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.050
The last time I measured it was about six months ago, so it might even be higher now.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.100
He can easily lift a high ball up to a higher point...

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.530
Meaning he can set the ball from the shortest distance possible.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.660
Kogane!

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.840
See ya later!

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.320
Yeah!

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.380
Do your best at the spring tournament.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:29.970
We will.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.090
Thank you.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.420
The Date Tech guys are still pretty intimidating.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.850
Definitely don't want to meet them in a dark alley.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.020
Moniwa's super nice though.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.360
No way.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.280
He's the one who put those two intense second-years on a leash.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.060
Maybe I'll grow some facial hair too.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.700
That's how you're competing?

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.270
Good work today!

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.590
Good work!

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.640
Don't go overboard with individual practice!

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.720
Right!

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.890
Especially those who have to bike over a mountain to get home!

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:24.860
Nishinoya!

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.350
I'll practice with you tonight again!

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.080
One more, Hisashi!

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.200
H-Hang on a second... I can't...

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.750
Gotta get your heart rate up when you're practicing serves!

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.460
You jerk!

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.260
Damn it!

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.040
I don't think I've ever seen Nishinoya that agitated, even during a match.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.110
Take this!

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.410
Wow, that was cool!

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.520
Hey, Kageyama.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.730
What are you thinking when you're receiving?

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.290
How I'm going to kill the ball.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.620
It sounds violent coming from you.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.960
Hey, Nishinoya.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.500
I'm pretty sure you could get by with just underhanded receives,

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.450
instead of forcing yourself to do overhanded receives, right?

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.140
I mean, I'd like to just do underhanded receives, and I thought I could pull that off.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.040
But there are people better than me.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.860
It's no fun if you don't try other options once you know they exist.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.530
There you go, saying something cool again.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:02.490
I want to be on the court more, but if I'm gonna mess up, I don't want any success either.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:09.160
But Nishinoya is having a hard time with my serves right now.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.000
I'll practice with you tonight again!

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.460
I take back what I said.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.340
This is my practice!

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.800
I'll do a serve that Nishinoya can't get!

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.720
Right now!

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.640
What?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.640
Kinoshita consistently serves the ball to the same spot.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.100
I think he's aiming there.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.870
I can't lose!

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.680
Having more good players isn't a bad thing.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.280
It's not like you'll be replaced as our pinch server.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.700
Yeah, but... That's not what I meant!

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.560
Oh, okay.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.420
If only you could practice receiving and spiking at the same time!

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.750
But when Kageyama's there, I really wanna practice spiking.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:02.100
Coach Grandpa Ukai said his place is gonna be on break for a while.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.290
But I'm an expert at practicing by myself too!

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.450
Whatcha doin', Bro?

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.000
Doing my Ultimate Lonely Passing Drills!

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.320
I wanna do that too.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.780
But then it wouldn't be lonely.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.320
And you wouldn't be able to do it anyway, Natsu.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.130
But I'm best at everything in P.E.!

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.470
Then use that.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.070
Try with the squishy volleyball first.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.710
First, bounce the ball up,

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.740
then keep the ball up in the air as you lay onto the ground.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.890
Then continue to pass and stand back up.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.470
Then you repeat.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.680
All right. Give it a shot.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.260
Not even close!

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.610
I'll show you how it's done!

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.640
How do you like that?

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.760
Bro...

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.790
You're getting along with the ball now!

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.470
It used to seem like the ball was a stranger.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.160
But you guys are like best friends now.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:21:59.880


00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.930
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:24.160
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:29.230
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.320
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.720
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.050
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.420
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:50.250
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.510
Turned them into conviction

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:57.980
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.600
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.450
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:12.770
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:18.370
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:23.080
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.520
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:29.840


00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.430
Sit Tavern Sit Tavern Hey, thanks.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.780
Want another one?

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.600
Something good happen?

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.860
The thing I asked Tattsuan about might make it in time.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:51.860
The Crows Fly to Tokyo Once Again

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.800
I guess it's finally time.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:51.860


00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.870
Episode Nine: Everyone's Night

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.800
Next time: "Everyone's Night."
