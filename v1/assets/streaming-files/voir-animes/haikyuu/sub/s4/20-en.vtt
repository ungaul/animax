00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.410
Inarizaki High School is switching out players.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.860
Taking the place of Ojiro Aran, number four, is the captain, Kita Shinsuke, number one.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.150
He's a player we didn't get to see in the videos.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.000
Yeah.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.540
I wanted to put a little more pressure on Ojiro, but whatever.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.550
Listen, guys.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.520
You don't have to be that guarded.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.470
I'm just a substitute.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.560
I'm here to tide them over.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.850
So you don't need to be scared of me.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.020


00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.820
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.040
Haikyuu !
!
Haikyuu

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.290
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.170
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.550
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.840
'Cause if we give up now It'll all be over

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.330
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.860
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.530
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.470
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.110
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.620
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.300
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.220
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.220
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.750
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.620
So let's start smiling

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.980


00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.400
Episode Twenty: Leader Episode Twenty: Leader

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.160
Episode Twenty: Leader Someone's always watching, Shin.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.120
The gods are everywhere.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.900
So someone's always watching.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.830
Gin!

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.210
Why'd you force that spike earlier?

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.550
I-It felt like the match was going in Karasuno's favor, so I tried to stop it.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.390
And that's supposed to happen by you getting blocked?

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.820
Everyone's so on edge as soon as Shinsuke enters the court.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.940
Well, his sound arguments are like a punch to the gut.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.110
Give us a good serve!

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.760
Right between...

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.290
Got it!
Daichi!

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.710
Looks like he tried to get them to set from the back row.
Sorry, it's short!

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.710
Azumane!

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.720
Yes!

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.360
Akagi!

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.180
Go for it!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.680
I hate this.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.480
Gin!

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.990
Hell yeah!

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.950
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories
Inarizaki scores back-to-back points!

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.310
Inarizaki Karasuno That one's gonna hurt Karasuno!

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.120
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.410
They got back-to-back points,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.040
but now, it somehow feels like plays the guys could've made earlier suddenly aren't possible.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.340
Guys like Shinsuke show up every once in a while.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.370
They're definitely not the star, but their presence takes over the whole court.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.850
He's had that kind of presence ever since junior high.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.150
Their number four won't hit a straight spike.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.970
Right!

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.900
He never did anything unnecessary and his words were precise.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.320
His plays needed a bit of work, but they were thorough.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.860
And now,

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.050
Shinsuke is overflowing with confidence.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.830
Not confidence that says that he's better than others.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.370
But confidence that ensures that he won't mess up.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.310
How does Kita just pop onto the court and play flawlessly like that?

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.720
He's got way more experience than you.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.870
Apparently, Kita never played in a match until his third year.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.550
Huh? Seriously?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.440
But he totally acts like he's a seasoned veteran.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.810
Which means even if he played in junior high, he didn't have much of a chance to play in high school.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.990
Actually, not only was he not on the starting lineup in junior high, they never even gave him a uniform.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.610
What?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.950
I don't understand why anyone ever gets nervous.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.660
What?

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.550
What are you, some kind of robot?

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.150
I mean, I've been on to you, but...

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.880
You only get nervous because you try to be more powerful than you usually are, right?

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.590
I mean, when you do day-to-day things like eat or take a shit, you don't get nervous.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.810
That should apply to volleyball too.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.730
If it's something you can do during practice, there's no reason to get nervous.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.310
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.030
Get out there!

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.830
Oh, there he is. Karasuno's first-year relief server.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.740
He seems pretty good at scoring.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.910
That felt good!

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.590
Shinsuke's abilities could be considered better than average.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.510
It's not like he's physically or technically impressive, or that he stands out in any way.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.980
But anything he can do during practice, he can also absolutely pull off in matches.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.390
The best praise you could give Shinsuke is to not be surprised.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.630
What, Atsumu? Did you catch a cold?

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.030
Shouldn't you be resting?

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.380
This is nothing!

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.080
I'll get worse if I don't play volleyball!

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.740
That's the spirit!

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.340
Love of volleyball conquers all!

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.270
Go home.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.380
Don't compliment him when he's obviously not taking care of himself.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.180
Why am I in trouble?

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.640
Ice cold.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.010
Now I'm gonna catch a cold.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.970
Boys' Volleyball Team What... the hell?!

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.640
Couldn't he be nicer about it?!

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.100

Atsumu, Make sure you eat and sleep ...........................................................-Kita

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.780
You're gonna make me cry!

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.590
Pickled plums?!

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.560
You gotta do it every day.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.510
Without fail.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.990
Taking care of yourself.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.620
Cleaning, tidying up.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.240
Thank you for the food.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.960
Your greetings.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.670
Volleyball.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.750
Don't worry about it.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.690
That's Shinsuke's ritual.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.940
The gods are everywhere.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.140
That's what Grandma would always tell me,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.950
but at some point, I stopped caring.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.740
It's not like I'm doing this for the gods.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.910
Repetition, being methodical, and being thorough just feels nice.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.850
Someone's always watching.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.980
Number one, Kita!

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.590
Yes, sir.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.970
Next up, number two, Omimi!

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:17.480
Yes, sir.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.500
I figured Kita was basically a robot.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.550
Yeah.

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:41.700
When an adult says, "The process matters more than the results," kids aren't really gonna understand.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.920
Results are everything!

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.240
But I totally agree with the adults.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:55.350
I'm basically built from my daily routine, and the results are nothing more than a byproduct.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.560
It's not like I'm gonna make a living playing volleyball.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.440
But I wonder if this is a result too.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.640
Who cares about the small stuff?!

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.330
You don't need a reason for emotions!

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.530
If you're happy, you're happy!

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.560
What're you laughing for?!

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.970
Yeah, you're right.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.910
I don't need any applause.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.470
I'm just going to do what I need to do.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.690
If Aran, Rintarou, or Atsumu throw our enemies into despair...

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:50.650
then Shinsuke's role is to prolong that despair.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.610
Inarizaki Karasuno
And Inarizaki High School is at set point!

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.300
Don't give up!

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.830
You're only eight points behind!

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.420
They're probably going to lose this set.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.380
What matters is how they lose.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.480
The final set is going to be affected by how the end of the second set plays out.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.970
Concentrate! Let's break their streak!

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.140
Right!

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.010
Please end on a positive note!
Let's stop 'em here!

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.030
Good. Looks like we've got this set.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.850
But you never know.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.380
Last year, the tables turned on us even though we were six points ahead.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.030
They could go for a new record.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.980
What?!

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.770
The first- and second-years are always moody.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.740
Seriously...

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.210
It's not like he ever yells or hits anyone, but the pressure he puts on everyone else is so intense.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.620
It doesn't matter what it is. This guy just never gives.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.460
Damn it, he's already here.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.370
Morning practice He's always there first

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.730
I wonder if there's a shortcut somewhere...

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.620
Morning practice Of course he goes all-out

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.780
What's a failing grade?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.720
Academics His grades are always at the top of his class

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.110

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.280
I don't put Kita in just to strengthen our defense.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.150
Whenever one team has a big lead, the second-years either panic or let their guard down.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.280
They should have authority, but they're mentally weak.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.870
Kita's the only one who can whip them into shape.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.270
Atsumu is aggressive and hates losing, which can be a disadvantage at times.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.880
Despite the fact that Osamu seems calmer than Atsumu, they still share the same DNA.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.030
Gin feels responsible and is passionate, which causes him to rush.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.060
When we're ahead or it looks like we're going to win, Suna starts slacking.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.430
I'm watching all of you.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.940
Their number five turned things around at the end of the first set.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.270
Give us a good serve!
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories
In that case, I'll use my serves...

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.480
to drag him back down!

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.300
Ryuu!

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.150
They're not holding back despite their lead!

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.110
Yes!

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.530
Go for it!

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:02.450
Here it comes!

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.620
Just try and stop me!

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.590
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.220
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:32.590
A powerful serve followed by a powerful fast attack allows Inarizaki High School to instantly take the second set!

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.990
Karasuno High School is at a loss!

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:50.000
Haikyuu!!

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:42.990


00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.420
We don't need the memories
We don't need the memories

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.420
The fast attacks from Inarizaki's number ten just keep coming!

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.670
Not to mention, Karasuno's blockers seem like they're on top of things, but their defense is full of holes.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.800
They keep getting around the same guy.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.510
Come after me already.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.820
All right! Let's change gears!

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.600
Right!

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.440
I've never seen Nishinoya be quiet off the court.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.390
I want to believe it's because he's concentrating, but I don't think that's it.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.830
You're doing that thing you do when you mess up in practice, Nishinoya.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.000
Get a grip!

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.400
You practiced more than enough!

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.520
You'll be fine.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.870
Yeah.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.470
Nishinoya.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.140
You can do it.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.710
Actually, I can't guarantee that.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.070
That serve is so intense that even you're having trouble getting it.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.020
That's Miya Atsumu's serve, and that's how it is.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.120
Also, I suck at cheering people up.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.450
I have my hands full dealing with myself.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.780
Really?

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.240
But I can also speak for myself.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.200
Even if we can't pull off an A-pass,

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.540
I'll still finish it off!

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.220
Yeah, I don't really care about the A-pass either, but could you get the ball higher?

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.450
Really?

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.300
You know... we really need to talk about your timing.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.890
Huh? What's your problem?

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.630
Well said, Asahi!

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.900
I wanted to say something too!

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.980
Hyougo Inarizaki Hyougo Inarizaki Atsumu,

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.970
seeing Karasuno's setter serve earlier has made you want to do a spike serve, hasn't it?

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.710
"Man, it's so much cooler just blasting a spike serve.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.590
I'm getting pretty sick of jump floaters too."

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.910
How does he know that?

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.750
Your jump floaters are scoring right now.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.630
You've been trying to crush their libero, so see it all the way through.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.890
Got it!

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.550
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.550
The ultimate challengers, Inarizaki.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.650
All right, let's go!

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.890
Yeah!

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.080
The unknown veterans, Karasuno.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.350
Which team will reach the summit first?

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.100
The fateful third set starts off with Miya Atsumu's serve.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.410
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.310
Out!

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.420
Yeah!
Just how many is he going to get today?!

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.240
The big-time server, Miya Atsumu!

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.090
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.380
He's starting off the set with a service ace!

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:53.650
Inarizaki Karasuno I totally thought it was out too.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.900
Atsumu's pretty sharp today.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.230
He might actually get a spike serve over.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.760
Yeah.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.050
Maybe the chances of him getting either one over won't change that much.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.940
But you just told him to do jump floaters.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.320
Both of his serves are powerful.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.940
But if he switches over to a spike serve and the other team manages to get it,

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.480
he'll end up thinking that he should've gone with the jump float serve.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.060
But if they got a jump floater that looked good,

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.800
knowing Atsumu's personality, he'd feel even more competitive and motivated.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.130
I think it's better for Atsumu's motivation if he gets those jump floaters over.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.850
The scary part is, he's always right about this stuff.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.510
My feet feel like they're nailed to the floor.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.580
I can tell that my response is slower than usual.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.590
I see.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.790
I'm actually scared right now.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.420
Left!

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.840
Azumane!

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.010
Yes!

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.660
Nice spike!

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.090
Wow, Asahi's actually being super dependable.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.970
It's all right for Nishinoya to have his hands full every once in a while.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.400
Karasuno switched up their rotation.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.980

If there's one unique rule about volleyball,

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.300
I'd say it's the player rotation.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.160
That's where, whenever someone serves,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.370
everyone rotates one position clockwise.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.880
As for the positions, they decide that before each set starts and submit it.

For example, a common rotation is for the setter to start off in the back row.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.540
That way, there'll be three attackers up front right off the bat.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:04.150
For Inarizaki, their setter is also their most powerful server, so both of these rotations apply.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.980
This is probably the rotation that Inarizaki always starts with,

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.990
and it's like they're trying to say, "We don't care what the other team looks like! This is our starting rotation!"

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:19.910
On the other hand, Karasuno tends to dive in headfirst, but I think they use a lot of trial and error.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.770
Inarizaki seems pretty strong regardless of the rotation they use,

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:29.500
but whenever their number four, ten, and eleven are up front, their offensive potential is at its highest.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.120
But Karasuno is a bit more extreme.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.090
Especially their middle blocker.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.930
Their tiny number ten specializes in attacking.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.920
He's basically a scoring machine, and he can do it from anywhere on the court.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.350
Also, he's an effective decoy.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.280
Their number eleven with the glasses seems to be the keystone of their blocking,

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.700
so you'd want him to be up there when there are strong attackers.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.650
Or maybe they should concentrate everything on shutting down Miya Atsumu's serves.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.340
Yeah, but starting off with their best server is vital too.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.160
Do they go with the setter or the samurai dude?

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.350
Yeah!

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.470
Crap! No one likes a blabbering know-it-all!

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.590

2nd Set Net

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:15.450
So the fact that Inarizaki is starting with the same rotation, but Karasuno is switching things up means...

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:22.430
3rd Set
that when Inarizaki tries to score, Karasuno will have different blockers?

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.280
Yes, exactly!

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.580
The matchups are different!

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.900
Every time the rotations change, we're going to see different little battles play out!

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.500

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.570
Got it!

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.280
Karasuno manages to get the ace Ojiro to touch the ball first!

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:38.700
That's a quick fast attack!

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.410
I touched it!

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.040
Yes!

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.870
Why are you freaked out, Hinata?

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.750
This is why Karasuno chose this rotation.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:54.250
Now, Four-eyes and the twins' fast attack will keep lining up!

All right, let's switch up our rotation.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.550
Even if we don't have Nishinoya in the middle for Miya Atsumu's serves,

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.910
he's apparently going to keep aiming for you.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.140
Talk about stubborn.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:11.110
Tsukishima, I'm going to have you go up against Miya Osamu and Suna Rintarou as much as possible.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.230
The twins' fast attack?

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.700
Yeah. That's the most unexpected thing we've dealt with so far.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.760
I'm counting on you, deviant fast attack killer.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.660
Uh... sure.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.120
Hinata's Inuoka strategy was pretty good, but unfortunately,

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:30.660
I'm pretty sure Tanaka's getting tired of having to try to block in the middle for Hinata over and over.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.210
I'd like to say I'm fine, but the middle's pretty rough.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.680
Are you jealous that I got assigned a big role, Tsukishima?

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.850
My bad. I guess I stole your big role from you.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.770
Tsukishima never forgets payback, and he slays.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.820
It's an art form, really.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:58.990

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.910
Aran!

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.770
The player we don't want on a roll the most is Ojiro Aran.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:17.210
I want him to hit another high wall one more time.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.710
Yes!

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.650
And he's shut down!

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:36.610
First-year Kageyama Tobio stopped the ace, Ojiro, all on his own!

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.610
Fly Fly Yes, yes, yes!

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.730
They've learned from the second set!

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.530
That seems like what Karasuno's back-to-back points are getting across.
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.290
Nationals always has some amazing blockers.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.740
I can't even count how many times I've been shut down.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:57.360
They come after me as though I look completely frozen in time to them,

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.220
and there are times they're in front of me before I even try to attack.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:06.070
Those looming hands are basically fear itself.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.470
And...

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.390
a block that's not scary isn't actually a block.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.610
This guy's way scarier than Four-eyes over there.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:21.990


00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.880
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:35.630
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.310
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:58.820
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:04.820
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:10.830
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.540
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.380
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:28.390
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:34.140
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:40.310
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990
