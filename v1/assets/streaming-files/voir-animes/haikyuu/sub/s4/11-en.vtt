WEBVTT

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.560
Right...

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.430
on the mark!

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.210
Yes!

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.270
I apologize if I kept you waiting.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.620
And there it is!

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.210
Karasuno High School's lethal weapon!

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.340
The fast attack of the first-years, Hinata and Kageyama!

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.010
We finally got to see it.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.070
The height of the hitter who just scored, Hinata Shouyou, is 164 cm!

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.310
He's the shortest hitter out of our team lineups today!

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.640
Oh man! That was so fast!

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.880
He's tiny!
So cool!

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.300
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.760
Huh?

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.320
His expression's totally changed from the training camp.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.260
Scary.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.710
Not to mention...

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.670
who the hell is he?

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.980


00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.280
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.900
Now, go bask in the orange glow

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.250
!
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !
Haikyuu

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.390
Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.510
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.390
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.400
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.110
If a person tries to live their life without getting a taste of their dreams and passions

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.830
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.870
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.790
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.970
Awaits a land Of thrilling competition

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.330
Unleash everything you've got

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.680
Winning or losing doesn't even seem to matter

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.860
When you're in the zone and everything flows

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.470
In glorious slow-motion Now, go all-out!

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.030


00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.910
Episode Eleven: A Chance to Extend the Rally

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.630
There's a chance that Karasuno may never get better.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.950
And even if they do, it could be years from now.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.290
Still, if the chance appears...

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.800
Daichi!

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.740
Yes!

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.760
Nice receive!

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.510
Sawamura!

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.020
You're so good now!

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.190
Yeah.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.890
You're so... Sorry, I couldn't catch all that.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.380
Don't just concentrate... ...on their number ten.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.320
That was a beautiful dump that basically laughed in the face of their blocking!

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.650
Tsubakihara Academy was caught completely off guard!

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.690
Kageyama, you bastard! You son of a gun!

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.690
You're so annoying!

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.520
Your personality sucks!

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.040
You cheeky little... Those were all insults!

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.280
I think the gelatin I ate earlier is giving me energy.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.560
My stomach is in perfect shape right now.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.060
Step back!

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.450
He just served! The setter won't be able to...

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.400
Karasuno Tsubakihara He did it again!

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.870
The setter, Kageyama, managed to flow right into that set!

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.890
Kageyama is a first-year who was invited to the All-Japan Youth Training Camp.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.110
Hey, Hinata!

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.950
Their blocker on the right side was late getting there! Hit it that way!

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.840
You would've run me over then! I would've died!

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.540
Er... They seem to be arguing about something. I wonder if they'll be okay.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.340
Then dodge me! That's, like, your one talent!

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.380
Kageyama, serve, damn it!

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.120
Man... They've got someone insane.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.090
Yes.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.060
He's gifted with this much technique, instinct, and passion.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.270
Kitagawa First Loses Just Barely
Perhaps it's because of that passion, but he didn't stand out much.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.780
But now...

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.360
the world will find Kageyama.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.140
Jeez, talk about an over-exaggeration.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.600
Or not.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.040
Even the Smallest Stream Can Become a Great River

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.220
We didn't come here to stop their number ten.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.040
We came here to win.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.350
The moment we're stuck focusing on their number ten is the moment we're stuck in their trap.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.310
Just keep doing your read blocking.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.860
That'll keep the pressure on them.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.010
Yes, sir!

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.280
There's no reason to panic.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.650
There's no need to do what we can't do.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.450
Dig out the ball and attack.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.140
It's that simple.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.760
Just fight the way you always do.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.820
Yes, sir!

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.400
All right!

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.010
Let's turn the tide on this "Go, go, Karasuno" mood!

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.620
Yeah!

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.580
Maru!

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.730
Yes!

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.160
Nice receive!

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.120
We didn't just come here to participate...

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.960
We came here...

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.340
to win!

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.050
They got one in!

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.470
Even the Smallest Stream Can Become a Great River

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.470
Tsubakihara smashes that one with their classic move!

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.930
The set from Echigo to Teradomari!
Yeah!

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.400
Nice spike!

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.350
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.810
All right! Their number ten's in the back now!

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.060
I mean, I do feel better that their number ten is in the back row,

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.530
but things still sorta suck for me.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.730
Because now this persistent guy, who was even able to block Ushiwaka, is up front.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.710
I touched it!

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.380
It's all yours, Daichi!

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.080
I touched it!
Let's score here!

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.260
Nice, Maiko!

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.010
What an intense rally!

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.020
Both teams have completely loosened up now!

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.880
Tera!

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.700
Three blockers!

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.320
Number four, Teradomari.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.770
He's got way more height and power than you'd expect from a high schooler,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.610
but he tends to use cross-court spikes over anything else.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.990
Ready, and...

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.410
Don't underestimate me!

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.530
A straight spike?!

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.090
I moved too far forward!

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.700
Nice backup!

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.710
Asahi!

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.360
Yes!

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.600
Karasuno Tsubakihara Man...

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.350
I'm can't tell if Hinata has really good luck or really bad luck...

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.560
Actually, Shouyou meant to be there right now.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.450
An attack from the back row!

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.840
A tip?

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.250
I moved too far forward again!

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.290
Finish it off, Tanaka!

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.300
Out!

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.380
Don't just hit the ball as hard as you can every time, Tanaka!

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.260
Okay.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.780
He's still trying out, but he's already showing he doesn't care.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.400
He's got good instincts, though.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.320
He's joining our team?

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.520
He returns the ball to the perfect spot. He sure is paying attention.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.140
Echigo, finish it off!

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.070
The setter, Kageyama, gets the first touch.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.710
They limited the possible attacks by having Karasuno's setter receive the ball.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.530
Tsukishima!
Right!

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.840
Left!
Azumane!

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:53.040
Tsukishima's able to pull off anything, even if he's not the best at it.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.390
But even if this set is a bit clumsy,

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.600
it's still full of care!

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:01.680
Get the last hit!

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.390
The set is too low! It's too sloppy!

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.260
I'm kinda moved.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.990
Three blockers!

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.190
All right!

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.410
Azumane smashed the ball off three blockers!

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.330
Karasuno Tsubakihara
Karasuno manages to get two consecutive points!

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:32.490
Azumane... I guess it's not just your looks that got better!

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.800
Yeah.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.270
Tsukishima! Nice set!

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.460
Uh, thanks.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.280
It's still really hard to get an idea of distance here.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.800
To be honest, that was half luck.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.150
Could you not react the exact same way Hinata would?

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.150
What?!

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.490
Even the Smallest Stream Can Become a Great River
Man, is their number ten a pro at body slams or something?

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.730
Use your hands!

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.410
He's not just relying on his usual animal instincts.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.700
He was actually seeing ahead.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.590
That's right.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.320
Even if it's not a powerful hit, it doesn't mean they're just gonna drop it up front.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.360
Nice deflect!

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.570
Let's go!

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.900
Get 'em, Hinata!

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.860
Back minus tempo!

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.580
Even his attack from the back row is incredibly fast.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.080
This is Hinata Shouyou!

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.540
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.560
Don't panic! Let's stop 'em at one!

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.540
Right!

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.990
Damn it!

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.240
No worries. We're getting to the ball.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.010
Let's keep our eyes on their blocks!

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.240
Karasuno's tiny number ten looks like he's stopped in midair.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.380
He sucks at receiving, but he's damn good at attacking.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.400
Sugawara, what's a back minus tempo?

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.360
It's Hinata and Kageyama's minus tempo attack from the back row.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.350
Sounds cool, right? Am I right?

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.650
How about adding "thunder" at the end?!

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.580
But then it'd just sound like one of your special techniques, Nishinoya.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.700
Hey.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.460
You'd better not mess up the serve once we finish our timeout.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.660
Of course I won't.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.040
Out!

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.570
Sorry!

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:48.260
Karasuno Tsubakihara Oh no... I'm up...

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.310
Kinoshita! You got this!

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.220
Aim for number four... Aim for number four...

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.280
It's out!

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.700
Even the Smallest Stream Can Become a Great River

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.020
Sorry about that...

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.290
Don't worry, you'll get it next time.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.130
I mean, I thought I managed to hit it way calmer than I thought I'd be.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.830
And I managed to hit it in the direction I meant to.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.480
That wasn't so bad for me.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.140
That's right.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.680
Be ambitious.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.480
Karasuno Tsubakihara Karasuno
Tsubakihara Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.140
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.520
And there it is. Karasuno High School is at set point for the first set.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.070
Damn it.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.550
He has to serve right now?

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.410
Even the Smallest Stream Can Become a Great River

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.410
Damn it!

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.640
Shake it off, shake it off!

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.660
Don't sweat it!

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.710
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:04.170
Tsubakihara Academy will be bringing in first-year pinch server Himekawa Aoi.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.610
Apparently, this is Himekawa's first official match.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.810
Yikes...

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.970
He's way more nervous than I am...

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.640
An underhand serve?

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:40.000
Haikyuu!!

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.000


00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.230
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.190
Nice.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.270
Let's just take that... Yeah!

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.160
Talk about lucky!

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.530
That sure was something!

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.720
Who the hell misses an underhand serve?

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.720
That must've hurt!

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.950
He's gonna have nightmares about that forever...

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.280
You can't be serious.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.160
S-Sor—

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.370
Seriously...

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.090
That was such a beautiful sound!

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.780
If you're gonna nail someone, pick someone other than me, Himekawa!

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.510
Tera?!

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.510
Uh, isn't that a bit mean?

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.750
More importantly, our serves the whole second half of that set weren't great.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.440
I know! Sorry, okay?

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.480
We won't get anywhere if we can't get our serves in.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.870
I'm very aware of that!

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.570
All right. You guys warmed up?

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.480
Yes.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.320
Yeah, we're warmed up. So much so I'm beat.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.150
Sugawara, could you not mimic my voice?

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.160
I still haven't gotten the hang of the distances in here.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.740
Yeah, it's not gonna be that easy.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.630
Fly Fly

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.580
Even the Smallest Stream Can Become a Great River

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.010
Nice spike!
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.300
Himekawa!

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.590
Feel bad for me and I'll kick your ass.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.020
I'm gonna be in the next match anyway.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.980
You just think about how to make the best use out of the few opportunities you get.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.450
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:36.670
The play that's the hardest to control mentally on the court is the serve.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.910
It's not your teammates who won't forgive you when you mess up—

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.750
it's yourself.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.550
Is he doing another...

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.880
He served into the ceiling?!

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.900
It's not fast enough that they can't react, and it's not powerful enough to blow any of them away.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.400
Got it!

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.390
But surprisingly...

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:20.500
It works pretty well, right?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.460
Even the Smallest Stream Can Become a Great River

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.010
Sorry!

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.210
Don't worry about it!

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.310
All right!

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.640
Nice serve, Himekawa!

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.800
We're counting on you!

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.660
Right now,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.560
this ceiling...

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.890
is on my side.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.520
That ceiling serve... was so cool!

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.400
Got it!

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.660
Uh-oh! Karasuno just let the ball drop!

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.110
Sorry! That was my bad!

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.190
I got in your way.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.290
Hey! What the hell are you even calling the ball for?!

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.080
That's two service aces in a row for Himekawa!

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.750
Tsubakihara Academy has taken the lead!

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.260
Got it!

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.970
Left!

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:16.130
Up front!
Right!
Nice receive!

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.150
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.150
Karasuno couldn't help but take their second timeout.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.750
Please try to get the ball higher when you receive.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.970
It's fine if it's short as long as it's high.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.100
Sorry!

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.800
We've got the momentum back!

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.450
They're starting to panic too.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.370
Let's keep it up!

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.580
Yeah!

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.430
Keep it up.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.140
Right!

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.880
I don't really get this "momentum" thing,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.230
but I can tell it's on our side!

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.770
Oh, so this is...

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.790
Here it comes!

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.190
Their number ten is already...

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.910
But there are guys coming from both sides!

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.470
Wait, the back left too!

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.390
This is...

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.950
nationals!

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.110
Himekawa.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.460
Get ready for the third set.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.920
Right!

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.880
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.070
80%...

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.740
And there it is! A service ace!

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.500
Yes!

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.220
Yeah!

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.720
Karasuno High School is slowly closing in!

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.170
Don't worry about it!

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.330
We have Teradomari.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.790
Wait, me?

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.650
Echigo's always keeping his cool.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.040
Thanks.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.720
That samurai guy's serve is super good,

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.050
but I'm sure if all four of us go for the ball, we'll manage somehow.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:14.700
I really wish you would've said you'd go after the ball yourself there, especially as a third-year.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.370
Asahi, do it again!

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.730
All right!

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.140
And there's a dump!

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.850
It's way too early to be packing our bags!

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.650
Yeah!

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.260
Captain Echigo sure is keeping busy.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.000
You've gotta have guts to pull through a situation like this.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.610
As you'd expect from the third-years.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.200
Damn it! Is he Tiredpants already?!

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.980
That jerk definitely just blamed this on me.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.210
That was definitely higher than usual!

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.670
That's right.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.200
It's still too early...

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.510
for us to go home!

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.390
Karasuno Tsubakihara Karasuno
Tsubakihara Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:05.640
Tsubakihara Match point... Karasuno

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.470
Karasuno Tsubakihara

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.260
They get this, and they win.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.790
Kageyama said this was just another step toward our goal,

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.980
but for me, it basically feels like I've finally arrived.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.200
Give us a good serve.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.920
You got this.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.130
I can't even tell if I'm actually nervous or not.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:24.830
Suga, you can do it!

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.130
Get a great serve over!

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.400
Suga, go for it!

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.740
But my mind is clear.
We're counting on you, Suga.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:31.950
I know what I have to do.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.290
Bring it on!

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.640
Uh-oh! Looks like their receive was a bit shaky.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.100
They aimed right for where the setter would have to get the ball.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.350
Tera!

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.080
Number four, Teradomari.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.870
He's got both height and power.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:00.280
He usually hits exactly where it looks like his body's going to hit.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:02.400
Sorry, someone get that!
Tanaka!

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.780
That was perfect!

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.200
Nice receive!

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.660
Damn it! That was a weak-ass spike!

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.350
Maru!
Left! Left!
Three blockers!

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:17.880
Number one, Maruyama.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.760
The ball goes flying off the blocker's hands!

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.880
However...

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.270
Sugawara's there!

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.810
Number one, Maruyama.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.560
He's good at wipes, but there's always the possibility he'll go for a tip.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:37.020
After seeing Karasuno's match at nationals, I decided I would come here!

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.000
Thank you for having us!

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:42.480
Still,

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.450
if the chance appears, you'd better grab it!

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.370
Go!

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.330
Stop them!

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:02.990
Chance favors only the prepared mind.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.470
All right!

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.020
Karasuno Tsubakihara 

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.070
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:46.300
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.370
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.460
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.860
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.190
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:07.570
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.390
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.660
Turned them into conviction

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:20.120
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.740
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.590
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:34.910
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:40.520
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.230
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:50.660
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990
