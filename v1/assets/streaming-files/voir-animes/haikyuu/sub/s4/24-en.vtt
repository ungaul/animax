00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.790
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.000
Haikyuu !
!
Haikyuu

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.250
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.140
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.510
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.810
'Cause if we give up now It'll all be over

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.300
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.830
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.490
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.440
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.080
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.590
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.260
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.180
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.190
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.720
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.590
So let's start smiling

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:29.990


00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.820
Episode Twenty-four: Monsters' Ball

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.910
I touched it!

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.630
There are plenty of guys in this world who we're no match for,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.590
and it's natural to find people like that amazing.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.590
Got it!

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.590
But if you're thinking they're prodigies from the start,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.550
that just means you've lost before you even faced them.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.270
And it's rude.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.230
Sorry, it's long!

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.620
Damn it... Just five more centimeters...

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.300
I should be able to reach that!

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.100
Jump higher!

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.610
Reach it!

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.490
His foot!

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.130
Hinata Shouyou shows incredible balance and instinct!

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.090
Inarizaki Karasuno
Karasuno somehow manages to stop Inarizaki from getting back-to-back points!

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.190
Damn it!

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.840
Don't get tired now!

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.310
Complain, damn it!

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.020
Complain? Why would I?

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.230
Gimme the next one too!

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.630
I thought Kageyama had nothing to be scared of anymore.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.660
But...

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.160
it's not just the other team that can push you beyond your limits.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.880
I'm moved, Shouyou.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.510
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.510
Inarizaki's cutting things off instantly now.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.690
This goes for both schools, but their ability to go straight for the middle when in a tight spot is amazing.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.770
There are times where Atsumu's concentration suddenly breaks.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.790
But today, it actually feels like it just keeps getting sharper.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.030
I do think that monsters exist, though.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.290
Yeah, so do I.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.630
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.280
There are monsters who profess their love for volleyball every day.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.630
Getting to meet them, stand on the same court with them, and face them on the other side of the net...

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.950
I was invited to the monsters' ball.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.120
Aren't I lucky?

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.010
Our only option is to get through this!

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.610
Yeah!

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.860
Miya Atsumu's serving.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.100
He'd been concentrating his efforts on competing with Nishinoya,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.740
but we don't know who he'll bare his fangs at next.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.210
The pressure the Karasuno receivers must be feeling is unfathomable.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.190
Following right after Karasuno's Kageyama, Inarizaki's Miya Atsumu just pulled off a service ace!

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.480
It's hard to believe that a high school student could pull off such a high-level serve.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.400
Hope and despair just keep chasing each other.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.750
Scary.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.860
It just passes by in a blink of an eye.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:33.740
One more point! One more point!

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.830
And Inarizaki High School is at match point!

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.390
Hey.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.110
We don't need a miracle.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.680
Things like this just keep happening!

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.650
Karasuno's not scared?

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.850
They're hanging on by their fingertips, and Miya Atsumu's serving!

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.860
One step back, and it's over a cliff's edge.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.020
You never get used to this.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.940
My hands and knees feel like they're going to shake.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.780
But we're not going for a miracle here.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.750
We're just going to repeat the same thing we've done time and again!

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.220
Daichi!

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.580
Just like a silent roar!

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.040
After that graceful jump float serve, he shakes up Karasuno with an intense spike serve!

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.110
It's gonna go over the net!

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.870
I'm not gonna lose!

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.860
Gimme the next one too!

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.850
I'm not gonna lose...

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.740
to him!

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.090
Seriously?

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.510
Hinata Shouyou goes down the center!

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.600
Kageyama Tobio manages to set the ball that was about to go over the net!

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.700
He hit that from so high up!

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.770
It's as though Hinata has wings!

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.020
And then there's Kageyama! I can't believe he got it to him!

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.490
The hell?

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.110
It's not that he believes in the setter.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.550
He just believes that the ball will come to him.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.920
"You'll get the ball up here, won't you?"

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.410
You've got my condolences, Tobio.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.570
You've got one scary partner there.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.960
What's so weird about that?

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.970
All y'all need to consider how others feel!

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.920
Huh? That wasn't funny at all.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.750
What are you—

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.390
It wasn't meant as a joke!

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.080
I win.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.350
What? Stop looking at me like that!

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.740
I'm the one who scored the point!

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.670
Hey!

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.630
It's all because of me, but whatever.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.350
Nice spike.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.310
Don't say that with that face!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.000
Inarizaki Karasuno Good luck!

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.430
All right.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.670
Their number ten is finally out for a while.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.600
Two more rotations and Azumane will serve!

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.810
That's probably going to be their best bet!

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.380
Make sure they don't score back-to-back points until then!

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.560
Man, I'm tired.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.200
Tired of running, tired of jumping,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.100
tired of their setter I can't predict.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.560
Up front! Samu!

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:32.660
If I could stuff him right now, I'm sure the whole team would lose their minds.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.620
I can't, though.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.320
So you'd better be there.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.980
And middle blocker Hinata Shouyou gets the ball up again!

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.380
Excellent positioning!

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.300
Shouyou!

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.450
Dammit.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.810
I've known this for a while,

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.230
but he's just...

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.760
so damn good at blocking!

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.900
We don't need the memories
I don't care if it's God, Buddha, or a goddess.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.860
Fly Fly Let us have this one point!

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.370
Counterattack!

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.830
Back row minus tempo!

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.000
Nice receive!

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.140
How do you even get that ball?

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.540
Who's that guy again? The libero? That was amazing.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.520
That receive was amazing, but the blockers set things up so that he could get it.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.390
The spikers, who try to break through those blocks and receives.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.820
The setters, who try to create the optimal situation for the spiker.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.180
The servers, who give it their all so the setters won't have to work.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.200
They all work together until the ball hits the ground.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.700
If you lose your train of thought for even one second, you get left behind.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:09:59.950
Damn it.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.960
My mind's clear, but my legs aren't keeping up.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.880
Sorry.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.800
Karasuno can barely stay on their feet.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.520
Kageyama!

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.000
You've got this.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.940
You've got this!

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.370
Azumane!

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.850
It's beautiful.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:40.790
I'm jealous of the first- and second-years, as well as the incoming first-years who will keep hitting these sets.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.710
Three blockers!

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.790
But at the same time, I feel sorry for them.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.300
Crap.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.930
Karasuno scores!

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.940
Yeah!

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.930
Nice spike.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.900
It pisses me off.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.180
Wait, what?

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.870
You saw that he delayed his spike timing, right?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.990
He was trying that out at our practice match.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.760
He was?

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.300
He waits for the moment the blockers start to go back down to hit the ball.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.450
If he messed up, it'd end up just being a weak spike.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.800
I couldn't tell at all.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.190
The fact that he was able to make this unpolished spike work

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.840
in the very last part of a match where everyone's tired, and he didn't ruin his form in the process...

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.680
It all pisses me off.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.440
Inarizaki Karasuno And now, Karasuno's at match point!

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.900
My chest's starting to hurt... Yeah...

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.330
Do you know how the guys on the court feel right now?

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.730
Their stamina's gotta be about to run out.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.670
And they're dealing with an insane amount of pressure and nervousness.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.240
They're thinking, "Whoever scores here gets to be the hero."

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:29.980
Haikyuu!!

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.970


00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.550
Inarizaki Karasuno Just one more point.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.690
Go.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.980
Go!

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.710
He really has some nerve getting excited over those first-year brats.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.670
Best high school setter, my ass!

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.840
Man, what a luxury...

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.410
Hearing someone mentally saying, "Give the ball to me."

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.380
That intent to spike that ball, as if he's saying, "I'll definitely get that point."

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.430
This is the best!

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.230
And using all that as a decoy...

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.730
is the ultimate luxury.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.350
I'm not gonna let them just keep digging out my attacks.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.300
I'm the one who actually attacked, though.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.300
And Suna scores the point.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.590
Inarizaki's attackers decide to mess with Karasuno a little longer.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.100
The Miya Twins haven't actually used their fast attacks that often,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.550
but they leave such an impact that they're still useful.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:50.200
And I'm sure Atsumu wants to use plenty of new toys.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.700
He's actually doing a good job holding back.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.520
Yes.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.760
Apparently the match on Court A is intense.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.170
They might actually go over 30 points in the third set.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.240
Damn, that sounds exhausting!

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.160
Inarizaki managed to get this ball up too!

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.180
Samu!

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.520
Their blockers are also insanely persistent.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.220
The tension's so thick here that it feels like it's about to burst at any second.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.530
Left! Left!

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.580
But they aren't going to let it burst just yet!

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.370
Each side's concentration is solid as a rock!

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.780
Look at that high spike from Ojiro Aran!

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.940
Yeah!

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.790
Just listen to the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium roar!

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.890
That spike went right over the block!

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.810
Inarizaki has a firm grasp on Karasuno's back and won't let go!

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.770
Miya Osamu's in the back, so there won't be a fast attack.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.360
Please use this chance to score!

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.040
Asahi!

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:51.560
It's long!

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.460
But...

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.890
he's still going to get that ball up in the air.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.800
I don't believe it!

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.550
Just how bold is this first-year, Kageyama Tobio?!

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.750
But it looks like all of Karasuno's players are going for the attack in the end.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.310
Nice, nice, Karasuno! Push it, push it, Karasuno!

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.500
Do it again!

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.940
They're all ready to land that spike.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:28.610
That's what makes Karasuno so strong, but it must take so much stamina and energy.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.240
Inarizaki Karasuno Inarizaki Karasuno

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.860
Inarizaki Inarizaki Inarizaki

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.870
Just one more point...

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.780
Just one more point.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.750
We don't need the memories

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.390
It's not going to reach!

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:51.680
Up front!

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:54.670
This guy...

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.850
But he's been going for the "just make it over" serve this whole time...

00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.810
Gin!

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.800
Back up!

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.740
Let's go!

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.200
Attack!

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:12.950
Hurry!

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.160
We have to be faster than them!

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.810
Before the other team gets back on their feet...

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.570
Before they catch up!

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.290
Fast! So incredibly fast!

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.890
Karasuno goes in for the kill!

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.930
The libero, Akagi, managed to save it!

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:28.980
Not good.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.510
Slow down! Slow down the pace!

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.470
Left! Left!
Slow it down, guys!

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:38.530
A straight spike!

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.900
Don't let it get through!

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.820
Left!

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.050
They're already blocking!

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.650
My running approach was too short!

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.290
Time for a rebound!

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.580
Go again!

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.040
Go back!

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.490
Slow down! Take it easy!

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.830
You guys need to slow down!

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.790
The rhythm of their strong will to finish things off is picking up pace.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.090
Stop panicking!

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.210
Do every step slowly!

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.710
Speed is a curse.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:13.530
It narrows their view, makes it harder to breathe, and makes them suffer,

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.410
but at the same time, they're strangling themselves.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.770
Faster, back to the net!

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.730
Got it!

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.040
Let's take it easy.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.720
It's so simple and such a minor thing, but it gets forgotten all the time.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.220
A receive that's nice and high.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.340
A receive that allows his teammates to breathe again.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.700
What the hell happened to Hinata at the first-years' training camp?

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.570
The crowd...

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.270
Actually, even most of the players on the court won't think of this as a big deal.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.560
It's just a pass to them.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.250
I may be small, but I can jump!

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.170
I want to hit the ball too.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.090
Set for me too.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.550
Right! I love spiking.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.430
But I still want to play.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.770
I want to stand on the court.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.710
Crap. I might just cry.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.950
Significant approach distance... ...achieved!

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.410
Synchronized attack!

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.420
Making time for your teammates also gives your opponents time.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.340
But that's fine.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.550
Now, take this head-on!

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.760
The final point...

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.510
This is it...

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.180
Finish it!

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.650
It doesn't... ...matter where!

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.590
We're not letting you through that easily!

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.600
They got it back over the net!

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.800
Holy crap!

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.970
Up front!

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.220
Karasuno's tenacity is throwing Inarizaki into chaos!

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.440
Get back in position!

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.410
Hurry!

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.330
Twins' Fast Attack... Twins' Fast Attack
Twins' Fast Attack

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.540
Minus Tempo Minus Tempo ...Minus Tempo... Back Back

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.060
...Back!

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.070
This position.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.530
This timing.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.650
This angle.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.100

Inarizaki Karasuno Inarizaki Karasuno

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.110
I think everyone was surprised.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.460
But we weren't.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.480
In a battle lasting a tenth of a second,

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.000
it was only these two who didn't waver even a millimeter...

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:58.960
at the twins' insanely fast attack from the back row.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:06.260
Speed is a very, very strong weapon.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.930
It's charming and cool.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.250
But it's not invincible.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.370
They knew that better than anyone.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:21.990


00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:28.800
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:35.550
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:52.230
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:58.740
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:04.740
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:10.740
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.460
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:22.300
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:28.300
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:34.060
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:40.230
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990
