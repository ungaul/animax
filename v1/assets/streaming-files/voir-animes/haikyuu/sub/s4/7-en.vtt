Nice one, Nishinoya!

Nishinoya!

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.170

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.590
Nice, Tanaka!

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.990
What'd you just say?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.280
You were blocking the back row attacker's approach.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.190
W-Was he?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.750
I'm not sure.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.630
Everyone's moving on their own, so I couldn't really tell.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.300
Gotcha.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.660
I didn't notice at all.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.470
The fact that Kageyama realized it while they were playing and Nishinoya realized it after he was told is amazing.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.900
I'm more amazed that he talked to Nishinoya like that...

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.690
You could've said it in a different way.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.410
Like how?

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.180
The hell did you just say?

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.870
All right.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.930
I'm gonna stop you right there.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.340
Sorry about that.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.240
I mean, Nishinoya under normal circumstances is one thing,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.670
but complaining to Nishinoya while they're playing is a first.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.390
Kageyama sure is something.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.720
I'm not really sure what it is,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.290
but he seems scarier than usual.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.500
They've been pumped ever since they heard that they were going up against Karasuno!

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.670
Even just a few days ago, they'd get distracted by the spikers on the sides and spread out more,

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.480
but they're holding their ground in the middle.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.060

What?

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.930
I landed the spike.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.870
If you have something to say, just say it.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.250
You know full well you'd start fighting if he said it.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.400
Or rather, if you actually think Kageyama can effectively put anything into words, you're gravely mistaken!

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.030
Exactly.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.720
But I mean...

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.850
He always has an issue with tone or saying something unnecessary,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.430
so it's weird that he isn't say anything.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.770
Kageyama!

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.230

It's not like he had stable footing,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.490
and yet he managed a set that's not too high, not too low, not too far, and not too close.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.670
How much has this guy practiced?

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.880

Don't worry about it!

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.810

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.590
You should've tried to block again.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.660
You totally could've jumped again.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.830
I'm pretty sure he realizes that already.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.310

Hey!

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.090
Tsukishima doesn't usually have a problem listening to others,

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.900
but apparently that's not the case with Kageyama.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.820
Yeah, it's not exactly logical. They just irritate each other.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.710

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.910

Nah.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.050

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.640

I...

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.430

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.610

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.350

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.890
I'm sor—

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.260
I've been thinking...

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.750
What's wrong with him being the King again?

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.720
Is it because he's too bossy?

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.190
Because he's too self-centered?

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.980
I mean, either way,

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.940
no matter what Kageyama says, if I don't like it, I'm just not gonna listen to him.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.360
No matter what he says, I'm not gonna listen if I don't like his tone.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.830
What he said.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.980
Yet I still see Tanaka listening if it's addressed to him.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.670
He's just strict when it comes to how his teammates are addressed.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.540
Yeah.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.800
I mean, I wouldn't mind if you'd speak nicer to me.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.720
So no one really cares if you're the King or not.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.140
I mean, the King is supposed to be cool.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.360
Nothing beats a set that's easy for the spiker to hit.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.490
And you find out what that is by communicating with your teammates.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.870
But that doesn't mean you can't fight.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.910
Are you really giving Shorty the kind of set he wants?

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.000
Have you even tried to?

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.500
How was that set, damn it?

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.030
I think I could hit it faster.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.220
Got it.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.200
You're a Goody Two-Shoes, aren't ya?

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.970
Uh... Sorry about that, Kageyama.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:12.000
I've been trying to time my hits so they don't match their blocks,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.190
but it just hasn't been working against Date Tech.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.570
Your sets are great, though.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.900
So keep doing what you're doing.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.000
I'm probably gonna get caught by their blocks again, so I'll just apologize now.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.120
My bad.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.300
And I'm not gonna give up trying for that super sharp cut shot.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.730
I mean, especially because we're practicing against Date Tech.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.710
If you don't like it, that's your problem.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.670
I can't make any promises.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.800

Are they fighting?

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.560
I mean, it's not like you fight because someone tells you to.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.400
But you know...

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.750
If Kageyama's starting to say what he wants to say, what about vice versa?

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.600
Kageyama's talent is extraordinary,

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.660
so the others might not know how to nitpick when it comes to him.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.830
Hey! You're not attacking the middle that much today!

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.180
You scared, Kageyama?!

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:15.970
What?!

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.290
Go down the middle more!

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.040
Actually, yeah. Compared to all the other matches...

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.260
He's going there less.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.880
I guess we do have someone who nitpicks.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.430
Nice save!

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.470

Not like I actually care, though.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.700
I guess even Kageyama messes up sometimes.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:53.720
Hey.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.340
I'm not gonna stoop down to your level.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.950
Oh, I see.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.550
That's perfectly fine with me.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.610
Kageyama does worry quite a bit at times.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.800
It's not like he was saying anything that weird earlier.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.560
Maybe he's still worried about what happened in junior high.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.230
He doesn't seem like the type to dwell on the past.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.410
People dwell on different things.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:31.500
And for Kageyama, the thing that happened in junior high must weigh pretty heavy on him.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:37.960
I mean, I don't know the details, but one thing's for certain.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:44.550
Kageyama realizes that there's a chance he might be wrong.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:50.090
And I think his teammates in junior high made him realize that after butting heads.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.720
Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.180
I touched it!

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.920
Here's our chance!

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.900
He jumped!

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.210
Kageyama's been adjusting to accommodate the spikers' bad habits.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.840
But now, he's decided to force them to hit from a higher contact point instead.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.190
So close!

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.280
But that sure was high!

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.560
Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.670
So you can fly.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.860
Way to look smug, Kageyama.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.760
Tsukki, calm down! Stay serene!

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.330
Kageyama, stop egging Tsukki on!

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.080
Shut up, Yamaguchi.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.540
"The setter's the coolest position of all because it makes you the ruler!"

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.990
The setter is the team's playmaker!

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.710
The setter is the one who has the most contact with the ball!

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.550
It's the coolest position of all because it makes you the ruler!

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.010
We're not just gonna forget that you said all that.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.100
No matter how much you try to act like a nice little boy,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.100
you're a king deep down inside!

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.500
Prepare yourself.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.150
From this day on you shall be known as...

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.870
the new King of the Court!

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.310
Looks like he got over it.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.860
I don't really know how others feel,

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.150
and apparently, I'm not the best with words.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.370
We know, duh.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.120
You just realized?

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.070
But...

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.330
I'll do everything I can to become the best setter.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.170
You're saying that now?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.880
You've always been that.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.660
Aw, apparently the King is a sweet widdle baby boy!

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.380
Come on, Tsukishima. Grow up.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.060
Wow, Hinata just said that.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.260
You're still mad about earlier, huh?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.850
You should've guessed that.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.470
Guess read blocking!

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.100
Stop confusing things.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.730
I can be a Goody Two-Shoes here...

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.930
It's normal not to know what others are thinking.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:59.160
I mean, thinking about it is important, but I don't think it's absolutely necessary when playing.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.000
You need to know the current state of the match and your teammates' conditions.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.430
Hey, they're starting to sync up way better.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.760
Nice spike, Tsukki!
Date Tech Date Tech Karasuno Karasuno

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.120
The longer Date Tech plays against us, the better their blocks get.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.020
If my contact point was any lower, I would've been completely blocked.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:33.220
Tsukishima's already huge, so I never thought his contact point was low,

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.620
but I guess he's able to hit even higher.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.820
I knew it!

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.700
Though he looks like he's having a hard time.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:46.320
When Kogane... Er, when Date Tech's setter was setting for him, he was hitting the ball about that high.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.190
I see...

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:51.280
Tsukishima hits the ball really compact, like, "fablam"!

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.800
Both his approach and his swing are tight.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:58.410
The middle blocker is all about fast attacks, so I guess that happens often.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:03.200
The setter usually keeps that speed in mind and sets lower too.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.220
But Kogane would end up setting too high a lot.

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:09.470
Sorry!

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.380
So during the camp, Tsukishima naturally...

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.150
Actually, he didn't have a choice.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.460
It seemed like he was trying to match up with Kogane.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.830
Oh... He must've been watching pretty intently.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.750
Wow, that's some growth.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.880
Yeah.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.310
Kageyama's super amazing for being able to bring that out.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.150
I'm not gonna let Tsukishima beat me in height either.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.780
Er... I meant you too.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.180
All right!

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.660
Nice spike!

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.160
Keep 'em comin'!

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.020
No.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.640
Tanaka, you're getting sloppy.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.150
If you're tired, we can sub you out.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:00.110
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that Kageyama thought he was looking out for me when he said that.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.010
I get it.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.270
I do.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.760
But... You're not subbing me out, dumbass!

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.960
However, I do admit that I fumbled that last hit!

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.090
Wow, he's being honest.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.420
Good boy.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:19.130
Tanaka's not exactly exhausted, so we should use this chance to experiment with how to deal with this situation.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.920
Even in a real match, we sub people out for a greater advantage,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.140
rather than to cover our weaknesses, right?

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.570
All right.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.350
In that case, I'll send fewer balls his way and keep an eye on his condition.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.790
Could you just do that a bit more nonchalantly?

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.160
It's not like I'm going to agree with you saying that.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.410
Nonchalantly?

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:40.820
I'll give it a try!

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.280
Hey, in my case, I'd prefer if you told me.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.740
I'd be more shocked if I quietly realized you were setting less to me.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.790
Jeez, you're a pain.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:56.880
Nonchalantly Teammates' condition Tell me
Nonchalantly Teammates' condition Tell me
How others feel The state of the match
How others feel The state of the match

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.300
I'll do my best, but I can't make any promises.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.200
That's fine. You don't need to spoil me.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.570
They're constantly evolving.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.780
But that evolution might not always be positive.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:05.970
However...

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.430
as long as we have these second- and third-years, I think we'll be okay.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:15.940
The third-years always talk about how much they appreciate good first-years joining the team,

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.680
but I guess it's the same deal for Kageyama.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.690
Yeah.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.640
Nice!

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.580
Kageyama!

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:27.950
Left!

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.660
Is it a bit too close to the net?

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.160
Gotta reset...

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.540
Sorry!

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.350
You don't need to apologize there, Asahi!

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.760
Oh, uh, sorry.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.420
We should've been able to back you up.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.840
Er, uh, sorry.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.380
It's sorta funny seeing him get yelled at for apologizing.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.310
Also, that's rare for Tanaka.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.530
Ryuu's heated up too.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.500
I feel like he stole one of my lines.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.010
Are we just ignoring the fact that Kageyama's set was off?!

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.940
Sorry!

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.790
I don't know what's going on, but Karasuno doesn't seem to be playing their best today.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.580
Gonna crush them!

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.500
Asahi!

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.000
Right!

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:17.460
Hinata, finish it off!

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.670
Crap, it's short!

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.090
Yeah!

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:34.900
My bad, Hinata!

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.850
Throw the opponent off guard with the serve,

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.860
then finish them off with a block.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.860
They've got the perfect serve and block.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.820
Karasuno Karasuno Date Tech Date Tech Right now,

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.810
Date Tech's most noticeable server is their new captain.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.360
But if they end up with any more good servers,

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.580
The Iron Wall of Date
they might just become untouchable.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:03.300
It's...

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.720
...out.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.680
That was close, Aone!

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.270
Next year,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.520
our most troublesome opponent may end up being...

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.280
Date Tech.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:21.900


00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.910
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:46.140
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.210
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.300
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.700
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.030
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.400
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.230
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.490
Turned them into conviction

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:19.960
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.580
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.430
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:34.750
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:40.350
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:45.070
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:50.500
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:51.860
