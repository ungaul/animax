00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.830
Hey.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.900
You can fly even higher.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.700
Shouyou!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.480
Heya!
Heya.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.950
Hey, Kageyama!

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.850
Hey!

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.140
Hinata, Kageyama! You guys made it back in one piece!

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.570
Heya, Sugawara.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.490
Heya.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.480
Heya, heya.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.380
You guys'd better not have been fighting as soon as you get back.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.400
Nah, they were already fighting when I brought the key over.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.840
That's way too fast.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.520
Well, I mean, that basically defines them! Right?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.180
Kageyama, how was the youth training camp?

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.980
Yeah, that!

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.700
How was the All-Japan?

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.160
The floor wasn't made out of wooden planks.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.530
You're talking about the court?

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.760
How was the volleyball?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.880
There were crazy-good guys from all over attending, right?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.990
Yes, everyone was really good.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.330
Yeah, them. More about them.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.960
Hinata, you didn't try to sneak into the All-Japan Youth Camp, did you?

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.740
Well, I, uh...

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.470
Apparently, he didn't try because he'd get arrested.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.550
Arrested?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.140
Tsukishima!

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.890
He was actually planning to sneak into the Tokyo camp.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.970
Nice effort, Shouyou!

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.240
Did you grow a little at your camp too, Tsukishima?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.280
Yeah, I guess... Did you get taller?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.600
Are you his aunt or something?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690
He'd better not have grown taller in five days.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.040
Heya!

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.270
Yo.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.660
I-I'm sorry for all of the trouble I've caused!

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.430
I mean, even if you stayed here, you'd be worthless on your own.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.180
Oh, shut up!

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.550
You guys don't need to keep reminding me!

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.080
I only said it once.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.600
Tsukki! Did you get taller?

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.300
Shut up, Yamaguchi.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.320
It sure was quiet for a couple of days.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.760
Yeah.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.950
Their fighting makes me feel at ease.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.970


00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.270
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.890
Now, go bask in the orange glow

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.240
!
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !
Haikyuu

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.380
Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.500
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.380
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.390
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.110
If a person tries to live their life without getting a taste of their dreams and passions

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.820
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.870
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.790
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.960
Awaits a land Of thrilling competition

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.320
Unleash everything you've got

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.680
Winning or losing doesn't even seem to matter

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.850
When you're in the zone and everything flows

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.460
In glorious slow-motion Now, go all-out!

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.980

Episode Six: Enhancements

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.880
Let me help!

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.100
Thanks!

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.710
Right around here?
Yeah.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.600
Hey, what's that tape for?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.170
We're splitting the net into nine parts.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.910
This whole past week, the team has been working on serves,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.180
and Mr. Ukai wants them to confirm where they want their serves to go.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.570
Like, see what happens and where the ball falls when they hit that location.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.850
70%...

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.150
Nice aim!

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.620
Yes!

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.240
Talk about straightforward!

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.300
Damn it. He got it so easily.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.760
Nishinoya couldn't receive it.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.880
Nishinoya's not great with overhanded receives.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.130
Then couldn't he have just dug out the ball like usual?

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.570
Jump float serves are hard to receive because they're so unpredictable.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.500
The best way to counter them is to position yourself further forward and catch the ball with an overhand pass.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.900
There's a good chance that we'll be facing stronger opponents who can use jump float serves.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.210
It doesn't hurt to come up with a few ways to counter those.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.870
Great serve, Kinoshita.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.710
Right?

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.870
What about yours?

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.930
I'm gonna stick to floaters.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.380
I can do it too...

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.980
Out.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.950
Yamaguchi's really pumped too.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.590
I didn't hit it as hard as I wanted.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.320
Is it going to be out of bounds?

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.740
There are times when Hinata pulls off superhuman moves,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.410
but what he did just now...

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.330
actually seemed like he meant to do it.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.120
Great job.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.050
Apparently, it's supposed to snow tonight.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.280
Ugh, seriously?

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.630
Hey, Kageyama.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.050
What do you mean by I can "fly higher"?

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.770
Come hit some open sets with me.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.560
You guys are tired from the training camps, aren't you?

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.390
No overworking yourselves.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.790
J-Just a little bit, please?

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.540
Just a little.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.700
Yessir!

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.290
Your jumps are always just "boing, boing."

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.280
Wait, what?

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.770
But amazing jumps...

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.500
are like "bam."

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.400
Basically, your job is to scuttle around.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.420
Don't say it like that!

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.830
So, like... you sorta jump on a whim like, "boing, boing."

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.380
This isn't anything new, but he sucks at sound effects.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.890
So far, they've been doing the trick,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.580
and I'm sure you're doing your best during matches.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.470
But...

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.410
I know that you can jump higher.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.070
When you jump, where do you put your weight?

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.270
Where?

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.490
My feet, right?

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.450
What part of your feet, you moron?!

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.470
Well, I never really thought about it!

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.400
Really?! So you were just flying that high without thinking about it, you nitwit?!

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.710
Wait, why am I getting yelled at?!

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:10.460
Consistent, huge jumps give you more freedom to react when you're in midair.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.760
And when you make those jumps,

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.110
you hear the sound of your feet kicking off the floor.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.140
You think they'll keep it at "just a little"?

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.270
It looks like it'll start snowing any moment now.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.120
You actually believed their "just a little," Daichi?

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.750
Shut up.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.700
Wait. Where are Hinata and Kageyama?

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.060
They said they'd be done in just a little bit.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.000
It's impressive.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.700
What is?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.140
I can get feeling like you're raring to go after going to a training camp,

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.500
but I'd prefer to take a little break afterward.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.670
How much does that kid love volleyball?

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.630
But...

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:57.110
am I the only one who thinks that Kageyama's had a scowl on his face ever since he came back?

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.330
One more time!

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.520
Yeah, it's amazing.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.200
The height and positioning are perfect.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.170
And he does it every single time.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.280
He really is good.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.280
Hey!

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.030
Your jump's drifting again!

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.550
Put all of your weight on the balls of your feet!

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.470
There's a huge difference when you're actually thinking about that!

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.350
The balls of my feet...

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.280
Concentrate on the momentum of the approach, and then...

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.750
jump!

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.600
Go home!

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.330
Nice spike!

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.520
Something wrong?

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.060
Oh, no.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.290
It just seems like...

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:17.050
Ever since he came back from the training camp, there are times where Hinata gets super quiet.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.660
I think...

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.270
that when Koganegawa was setting for you, you were hitting at a higher spot.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.600
I'm jumping like I'm supposed to, thanks.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.690
Really?

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.520
Maybe I just imagined it, then.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.360
Kageyama.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.830
Yes, sir?

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.370
I mean, I've technically heard about how the camp went, but...

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.630
How was it really?

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.070
You know... Is something bothering you?

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.990
Nope, sir.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.300
I see.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.990
What do you think "Goody Two-Shoes" means?

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.850
So someone said that to you?

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:09.730
Yes.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.450
Another setter at the camp said that to me.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.650
I shouldn't be surprised, but that camp definitely must've had some hard hitters.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.680
Nothing beats a set that's easy for the spiker to hit.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.040
That's what Gramps always told us.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.170
I'm certain you're doing that,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.550
so there's no reason for you to hesitate.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.000
They should be here any minute now.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.180
Yeah.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.390
Asahi, you're not scared anymore, are you?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.570
I couldn't ask for better opponents.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.070
Not to mention, there's something I want to test out.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:02.990
Huh?

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.330
Miyagi Prefectural Karasuno High School

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:35.060
Haikyuu!!

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:27.970


00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.020
Thanks for having us!

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.930
Thanks!

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.650
I see they're as intimidating as ever.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.990
No locking on.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.330
Hinata!

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.220
Kogane!

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.830
Tsukki!

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.460
Thank you for coming today.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.920
Congratulations on making the spring tournament.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.350
All our boys are pumped up today.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.700
Thank you!

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.350
We look forward to playing you!

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.520
You'd better not hold back just because it's a practice match.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.480
Right! You got it!

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:26.690
When Koganegawa was setting for you, you were hitting at a higher spot.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.320
Gather 'round!

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.760
Date Tech's blocking is definitely the best in the prefecture.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.170
Probably even one of the best in the country.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.880
I heard they've gotten even better since the spring tournament prelims.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:52.850
We definitely don't have enough time to get our blocking up to their level.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.620
Listen up.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.900
Date Tech's blocking has gotten even better in the last six months.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.360
Get familiar with those walls.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.660
That way you won't panic when you face similar walls during nationals.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.680
Right!

Date Tech Date Tech Karasuno Karasuno

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.280
Nishinoya!

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.410
Got it!

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.800
Whoa, Hinata's fast!

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.580
Is that the rumored super fast attack?!

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.140
Bunch...

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.830
read blocking!

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.990
Our fast back row attack usually gets only one blocker, if any at all.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.420
Not to mention, they even used Hinata as a decoy.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.770
They pretty much had three blockers.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.950
They all blocked!

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.420
Talk about lightning-fast reflexes!

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.330
Just like Tsukishima did during our match with Shiratorizawa,

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:54.140
great blocks apply a lot of stress not only to the spikers, but to the setter too.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.600
For Kageyama,

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.670
this might be a much harsher match than the one against Shiratorizawa.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.520
Date Tech Date Tech Karasuno Karasuno All right!

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.380
We did it!

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.750
Taunt us, will you?

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.000
A triple block...

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.640
I'm sure Kageyama wanted to get through that high triple block on the first try.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.190
That brazen jerk.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.250
Looks like he tried a little too hard.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.890
Damn it. I was sure they were going to follow Hinata.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.410
Let's see...

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.540
The way that Date Tech jumps for their blocks is read blocking.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.770
That's when they jump after seeing the set, right?

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.400
And their formation...

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.030
They use the bunch shift, right?

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.720
Yeah.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.860
Bunch as in "bunch up."

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:58.220
For bunch shifting, the blockers bunch in the middle so they can move wherever the opponents might attack,

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.530
and that they counter it with as many people as possible.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:08.790
Bunch (Up) Shift Bunch (Up) Shift

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:07.670
But since they're bunched up in the middle, it's harder to counter fast attacks from either end of the court.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.940
Up until now, we, and most of our opponents, have used a spread shift.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.870
Spread means to "spread out,"

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.150
so in this formation, the blockers spread out across the whole net.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:28.480
Spread (Out) Shift Spread (Out) Shift

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.770
It's not the best formation for fast attacks in the middle,

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:27.740
but it's be able to apply at least one blocker to an attack anywhere on the court.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:33.440
It sounds like the spread shift would have a higher probability of success.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.850
Since they're evenly spread out.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.800
Evenly spread out, huh?

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.910
True.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.870
But when read blockers are experienced with bunch blocking,

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.270
they're pretty damn scary.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.050
Daichi!

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.960
Gonna break through the middle!

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.470
Their goal is to always build multiple walls anywhere along the net.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.950
That's...

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.230
the bunch read blocking strategy.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.790
Nice spike!

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.280
They managed to get a finger on the very first one.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.450
And there were two blockers ready.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.410
The pressure you feel when you've got multiple blockers on you...

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.580
is intense.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.340
Nice spike!

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.710
Date Tech Date Tech Karasuno Karasuno

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:32.940
Give it all you've got!

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.670
Right.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.440
Pants!

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.640
Got it!

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.770
I see that they're still insanely fast at scooping up the ball.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.390
Damn!

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.550
Date Tech's blocks are so damn cool!

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.990
They moved to the side so fast!

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.510
Not to mention, two of them bunched up so fast.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.510
Yeah!

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.750
Sorry about that.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.310
It was a perfectly fine set.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.960
Just now, I thought an attack from the right was our best bet.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.060
Setting aside if that was actually the best decision or not,

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.710
the pressure I felt just now definitely affected my actions.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.330
Even if it was only a little.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:01.800
Just now, Date Tech's block actually made me choose anything but the middle.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:07.320
Even watching as an amateur, Date Tech's blocks are terrifying.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.190
Blockers and setters continue battling even before and after the attack.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.930
It's a battle to see who can apply the most pressure.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:38.270
This is great.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.610
Playing with talented players feels so good.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:55.020
Date Tech Date Tech Karasuno Karasuno Obara!

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:55.990
Got it!

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.540
Kogane!

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.200
My bad!

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.910
That was an intense setter dump!

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.910
Left!

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.080
Azumane!

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.400
Looking good...

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:23.840
My bad!

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.140
I touched it!

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.960
Oh wow.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.610
I guess Karasuno does have a blocker.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.190
Futakuchi!

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.660
A tip!

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.130
Rolling...

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.430

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.750
Nice one, Nishinoya!

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.210
Nice receive!

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.380
Nishinoya!

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.340
You're in the way!

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.460
What?!

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.040


00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.120
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.350
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:51.420
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.510
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.910
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.240
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:07.610
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:12.440
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.700
Turned them into conviction

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:20.170
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:24.790
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:29.640
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.960
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.560
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.270
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:50.710
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990
