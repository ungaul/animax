00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.230
Huh? Oh, I've got practice.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.920
But all your matches ended yesterday.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.270
Huh?

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.040
Wait, wait, wait... Asahi... Azumane Asahi.

Hey!

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.010
Heya.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.440
Why are you playing basketball?

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.370
Why? This is the basketball team's gym.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.590
Wh-What about the volleyball team?

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.790
Where's everyone else?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.810
Who are you talking about?

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.250
Who...

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.950
You're the only one on the volleyball team.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.110
That sucked.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.390
That was the worst possible first dream of the year.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:34.990


00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.290
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.910

Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.520
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.400
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.400
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.120
If a person tries to live their life without getting a taste of their dreams and passions

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.830
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.880
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.800
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

I got here way too early.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.390
We're not supposed to meet for another half an hour.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.520
Happy New Year Happy New Year

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.480
Wait, sorry...

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.440
Did I get the time wrong?

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.330
No, not at all.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.410
Happy New Year.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.960
It's out first time doing a first shrine visit of the year together.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.670
It's a first first!

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.230
Wait, what was last year's, then?

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.570
Just the worst?!

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.170
Hey, come on, already!

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.450
No! You need to calm down, Suga!

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.470
And you should at least react a little.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.540
You're barely even breathing.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.670
I'm gonna go get a fortune.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.110
Me too.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.320
I haven't done it in forever.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.270
What about you, Asahi?

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.100
I'd get pretty depressed if I picked a bad one...

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.500
You'll be fine. You're overthinking it.

That's some skill.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.110
If you got "terrible luck," it'd actually be funnier or even lucky,

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.950
but you got a plain ol' boring "bad luck."

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.110
It's like one of those morning news fortunes.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.970
Shut up! What the hell did you two get, then?!

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.540
Good luck to come.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.890
That's way more boring!

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.360
Come to think of it,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.380
when you go to a shrine, you're supposed to be thankful for everyday things, rather than ask the gods for things.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.460
Huh?

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.790
But I asked for so many things...

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.840
Like, concerning our matches, and even my future.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.210
I even asked for good health for the old dog next door.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.880
The gods probably think I'm super annoying now.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.810
The gods aren't that unforgiving.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.930
I mean, I don't blame you for at least asking for us to win.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.180
It's not like asking the gods to help will win our matches.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.490
Uh, Shimizu...

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.400
Did you really have to bring that up right now?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.150
Don't worry.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.130
Even if the gods don't help us, we'll be fine.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.930

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.540
The gym's not open today.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.500
I swung by after my New Year's shrine visit and ran into everyone!

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.470
I just swung by during my jog.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.800
I ran away from my drunk sister.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.670
I was looking for a worthy challenger!

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.600

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.860
Huh?

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.480
I'm asking if you'd die if you had to stay still!

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.090
Go on.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.540
Your days off are meant to be for resting!

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.320
I'll kick your butts if you catch a cold.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.040
What are you doing here, Daichi?

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.630
I came to make sure the basketball team didn't take over our court.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.710
Huh?

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.670

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.020
Oh...

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.170
What? You nervous?

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.860
Yeah, I'm super nervous.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.580
Just the fact that you beat Shiratorizawa and are going to nationals is amazing.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.520
There's no reason to feel any pressure.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.470
Just relax and go do your best.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.250

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.860
I'm seriously counting on you, Sawamura.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.770
Yeah.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.330
Huh?

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.650
I always get way too scared.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.230

We're going to be dropping off our luggage at the inn,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.800
then we're going to be lightly warming up at the gym that Coach Nekomata arranged.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.680
Listen up.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.450
I'm sure you know this,

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.470

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.240

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.650

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.520

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.370

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.860

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.360
Hey, you totally could've gotten that!

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.320
Right!

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.100
Is it me, or is there less oxygen here?

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.030
We're not in the mountains, so...

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.580
Looks like all the nervous ones are already getting antsy.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.650
Make sure you're breathing, Asahi!

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.500
I thought that Hinata had gotten used to keeping his nerves in check,

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.720
but I guess we can't be surprised since it's their first time at nationals.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.030
Hitoka, let's remember to breathe.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.120

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.280
Got it.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.040
What the heck? Why aren't you asking me, the vice captain?

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.720
You're just going to encourage them, so no.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.960
Boo.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.030
Kageyama?! Where are you going?

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.570
I'm going for a jog.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.030
I haven't moved around enough today either, so I'm gonna go with!

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.700
Huh?

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.400
Wait, you can't!

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.950
No, seriously, you two can't go!

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.670
It's the concrete jungle of Tokyo out there!

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:39.750
But if they don't go running and have trouble sleeping tonight, that'll be a problem too.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.600
Tsukishima!
Not happening.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.260
I haven't even said anything yet!

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.680
Weren't you going to ask me to go with them?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.810
You've been wandering around yourself, so you're probably antsy too.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.230
Do you really think I can keep up with those two?

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.410
Thank you very much.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.980
Oh, don't worry about it! Use it as much as you want.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.620
It's pretty beat up, though.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.570
Thank you.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.550
As soon as I say we're heading back, we're heading back.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.260
If you don't listen,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:21.470
I'll make sure to leave you somewhere with limited public transportation so you'll have a tough time getting back.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.360
Even then, you'd probably never find this inn.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.340
Got it...

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.200
Looks like Hinata and Kageyama are going for a jog.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.310
You're not going, Yamaguchi?

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.520
Nah, I feel more at ease watching these videos.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.980
You're studying here too, Suga?

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.120
Yeah, I always study right about this time.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.040
You're so calm. That's so cool.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.450
Or rather, I'm studying so that I can stay calm.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.060
It's basically like a routine.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.950
Asahi, how many times are you going to watch our "I'm Awesome Video"?

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.270
I mean, these are all just so cool.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.820
I mean, these are all my teammates?

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.920
Anyone who saw this would be like, "Holy crap! Karasuno's the best!"

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.920
Playing right into Mr. Ukai's hands, I see.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.890
What's up with you two?

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.280
I mean... Kiyoko is enjoying her bath right now!

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.560
How can we stay calm at a time like this?!

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:25.150
If I let my guard down, my fantasies are going to overwrite all the images in my head from the "I'm Awesome Video"!

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.600
Me too!

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.030
I'm pretty sure you two could keep both of those things in your minds without a problem.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.280
Women's Bath

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.740
I'm so nervous when it's just the two of us.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.100
I need to think of something to say!

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:44.750
U-Um... you still wear black tights with your summer uniform, right?

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.510
Doesn't that get hot?

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.130
Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry for commenting on your wardrobe!

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.450
I'm going for a run!

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.140
Uh, wait?!

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.600
I have a lot of scars on my legs.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.990
I started wearing tights to hide them and just got used to it.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.600
Huh? Scars?

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.560
I was a hurdler on the track team,

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.250
But I would trip over the hurdles more than others.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.260
My arms are okay, but I've got plenty of scars on my legs.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.990
Hurdles... That's so cool!

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.460
So they're like a medal of honor!

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.160
I'm so sorry! I can't believe I called scars "a medal of honor"!

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.260
What is this, a battlefield?!

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.540
That makes me really happy.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.290
Huh?

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:41.450
Our junior high track team was huge, and I'm not to the best at talking to people.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.740
It's not like I had any juniors I was particularly close to.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:51.240
And even when I first joined the Karasuno volleyball team, it's not like I had another younger manager with me.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.530
You're the first person I've been able to talk to like this, Hitoka.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.270
And...

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.830
there's not much time left.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:07.580
Tomorrow night, after we win our first match, let's come back to this bath again.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:12.780
Yeah!

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.790
The National High School Volleyball Tournament,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.590
otherwise known as the spring tournament.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.460
Considered by some to be like a baseball team playing at Koushien Stadium,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.350
it's one of the most highly-observed volleyball tournaments.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.550
We're here!

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.650
This is the stage were the Little Giant fought!

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:12.720
Uh, the place where you said you saw the Little Giant compete isn't here. It's in Yoyogi.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.650
Okay, shut up! I'm talking about the mood!

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.690
The mood is what's important!

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.070
Is this...

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:26.710
Could this be the lucky pervy incident I've always dreamed about?

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.210
Otherwise known as... a lucky perv.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.780
I'm sorry.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.890
There's just nothing I can do about this.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.600
Thank you, God.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.670
Thank you, Shouf—

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.440
Are you all right?

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.170
Yes! I'm fine!

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.440
Hey! Is that you, Kanoka?

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.070
It's been a while!

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.770
H-Hey, Ryuu!

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.610
Ryuu, you know her?

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:55.500
Yeah.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.420
She's a wing spiker from Niiyama Girls' High.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.610
Have you been well?

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.980
How long has it been? Since fourth grade?

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.240
Yeah.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.220
I see you're as huge... as... ever...

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.650
She's matured... so much.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.090
And Tanaka's turned to stone.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.630
I thought it was weird for Tanaka to be able to speak to a girl so casually.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.820
It appears that he just now realized that she's a girl.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.180
Well, that's rude.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.810
Well, let's both do our best, Ryuu!

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.680
Y-Yeah...

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.940
Hey, Kageyama. 'Sup?

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:30.890
Komori.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.500
It's been a while.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.530
Whoa, even Kageyama knows someone.
Yeah. How you doin'?

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.620
They must've been together at the youth camp.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.580
Good.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.860
You're not nervous?

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.520
I think that's Komori Motoya.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.630
No.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.930
That's impressive.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.960
Is this your second spring tournament, Komori?

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.670
I saw him listed as the top high school libero in Monthly Volleyball.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.280
Yep. But I'm still not used to it.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.470
Sakusa's not with you?

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.990
He's over there.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.960
He absolutely hates crowds.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.780
Hey, hey, hey!

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.260
Hinata, hey!

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.190
Bokuto!

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.400
So you've finally made it, my number one pupil!

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.100
Hinata, you can tell him when he's wrong.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.320
That's Bokuto from Fukurodani.
What's up, Hinata? You nervous?

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.120
He's definitely got a presence.
Yep!

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.440
I see, I see.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.560
His pupil? Does he mean that wide-eyed shrimp? Who's that?

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.560
But listen up, Hinata.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.230
I'm not gonna go easy on you once the net's between us.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.520
Right!

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.950
Tsukki! Tsukki! Tsukki?

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.350
Hey, Tsukki, did you get taller? You did, huh?

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.240
Yo.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.460
Did you finally see the real Skytree?

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.170
You country bumpkin crows.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.290
Oh, dear me. Are you actually nervous, Sawamura?

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.910
Pretty sure talking too much is a sign of nervousness, Kuroo.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.890
Thank you for waiting.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:54.800
We will now begin the opening ceremonies for the National High School Volleyball Tournament,

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.670
otherwise known as the spring tournament.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.490
The championship flags are now entering.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:08.910
And the 47 representative schools from across Japan are now entering as well.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.870
Hokkaido Hokkaido Ooya Tech
Ooya Tech Hokkaido Hokkaido
Ooya Tech Ooya Tech Hokkaido
Hokkaido Ooya Tech Ooya Tech

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:15.070
Hokkaido's first representative, boys, Ooya Tech.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:10.870
Ooya Tech

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.830
Of course, everyone's nervous.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.710
But you need to be calm, Ukai.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:19.960
I know that.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:25.070
Hokkaido's second representative, boys, Morikawa High School.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.370
You need to go to the bathroom again?

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.960
N-No, I don't!

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.720
Miyagi Prefecture's representative,

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.360
Miyagi Karasuno Miyagi Karasuno
boys, Karasuno High School.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.480
Karasuno Karasuno Karasuno

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.130
Girls, Niiyama Girls' High School.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.560
Fukushima Prefecture's representative, boys, Furukata High School.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.500
Girls, Iwaki Girls' High School.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:14.980
It's starting.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.410
The battle on the orange court!

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:21.980


00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.030
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:46.260
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.330
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:56.420
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.820
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.150
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:07.530
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.350
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.620
Turned them into conviction

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:20.080
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.700
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.550
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:34.870
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:40.480
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.190
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:50.620
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.950
