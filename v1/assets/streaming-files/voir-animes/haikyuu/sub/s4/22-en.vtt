00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.630
Sorry! Someone get it!

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.960
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.960
I'm always amazed you can pull off that set.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.990
You could just go underhand.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.920
Well, it's a setter's job to set.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.460
I have to set the ball to the best spot.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.380
And?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.000
Underhanded, it would've been two arms.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.630
But overhanded, I've got ten fingers.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.500
I went with the higher number for better support.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.970
Because I'm a setter!

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.820
I'm on a team with someone who plays volleyball like that.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.780
And yet I've been playing so half-assed.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.590
We don't need a guy who just gets the serve over the net on our team.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.760
I thought I'd never get a chance again.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.230
Even the best team in the world would lose if they kept doing the same thing.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.710
We haven't even become best in Japan yet.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.760
If we keep holding onto yesterday, what are we going to be tomorrow?

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.560
You only need one thing.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.070
Challenge yourself today.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.990
We don't need the memories 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.790
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.010
Haikyuu !
!
Haikyuu

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.260
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.140
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.520
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.810
'Cause if we give up now It'll all be over

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.300
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.830
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.500
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.440
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.080
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.590
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.270
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.190
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.190
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.720
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.590
So let's start smiling

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.950


00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.290
Inarizaki Karasuno Episode Twenty-two: Pitons
Episode Twenty-two: Pitons Episode Twenty-two: Pitons

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.870
Give us a good serve!
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.040
Challenge...

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.000
yourself today.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.810
Nice serve, Heisuke! Go, go, Heisuke! Do it again!

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.340
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.810
Unlike his stint in the second set, Riseki Heisuke lets loose a tremendous serve!

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.310
Yes! Yes!

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.330
Attaboy!

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.430
His serve is manageable. Let's stop him at one.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.650
Karasuno High School's Coach Ukai is trying to cut things off quickly.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.650
Yes, sir!

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.610
So basically everyone in Inarizaki's cheer squad is like that one old guy with the muttonchops.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.440
He'll cheer for plays he thinks were good and boo the bad ones.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.170
After a timeout, it's Riseki's turn to serve again.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.630
Can he keep up his concentration?

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.670
Ryuu!

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.050
It's long!

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.280
That serve threw them off, and then Ojiro Aran just spiked it straight back at them!

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.160
That was intense!
Yes!

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.400
Yeah!

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:19.330
Nice spike, Aran! Push it, push it, Aran! Do it again!

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.360
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.320
Inarizaki Karasuno
And instantly, Inarizaki is right on Karasuno's tail.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.880
Don't panic, guys... Don't worry. It'll be okay.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.290
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.900
Hey, nice job!

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.700
I'll get three points next time!

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.400
At least say you'll get ten. How serious are you?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.480
A hundred percent.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.340
Dang. He's really comin' for them.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.300
Give us a good serve!
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.820
Kageyama!
Left!

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.770
Tanaka!

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.320
Their number five on the left has an insane cut shot.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.110
But...

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.820
you ain't got much more, do you?

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.430
You're just a weaker version of Bokuto.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.320
He stopped it!

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.650
Tanaka Ryuunosuke's been on a roll since the end of the first set, but he was just stopped in his tracks!

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.760
Looks like third-year Omimi just shut down the spike location that kept getting by them.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:08.680
Inarizaki Karasuno
Inarizaki didn't just catch up. They managed to turn things around and take the lead!

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.530
Inarizaki just scored their 13th point, which marks the halfway point, so the teams will now switch sides.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.560
Faculty Office Faculty Office

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:24.740
It seems like first-year Riseki's serve turbocharged Inarizaki.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.370
Of course, confident serves like that are powerful,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.250
but they also put pressure on their opponents, while giving their own team a boost of encouragement.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.250
It's pretty hard to get them right, though.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.340
Will Karasuno High School be able to stop Inarizaki's momentum?

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.800
Inarizaki is still showing some instability.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.900
They're all individually powerful,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.780
but sometimes their teamwork is off, and their aggressiveness can backfire on them.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.850
But they're called the Ultimate Challengers because they can also make all this work in their favor.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.370
Number three.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.460
I know.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.820
The fact that they're ranked second in the country is proof of that.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.610
It's gonna get rough if you let them keep going.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.970
Who the hell cares about being ranked second in Japan?

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.300
Second? Or was it third?

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.490
It doesn't really matter, really.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.490
That was yesterday.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.370
Get it!

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.330
Yesterday's already gone.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.840
Kageyama, finish it off!

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.800
Right! Right!

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.010
Plenty of yesterdays have already been converted into muscle.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.910
That was a difficult shot, but Kageyama managed to get it back over, aiming right for their setter, Miya Atsumu!

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:30.890
Osamu!

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.310
But Inarizaki has...

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.290
Miya Osamu!

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.870
Will he set to their number two in the middle, or to their ace on the left?

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.950
What are we... ...going to do... ...today?

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.040
The twins' minus tempo fast attack... reverse!

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.500
Wh-What was that?

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.430
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.340
Unbelievable!

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.310
That was a set from the spiker Miya Osamu to the setter Miya Atsumu!

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.270
They just dealt a minus tempo fast attack!

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.960
The Miya Twins are a terrifying duo!

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.440
If we keep holding onto yesterday,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:33.400
We don't need the memories

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.200
what are we going to be tomorrow?

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.360
What the hell? Damn it!

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.900
Hell yeah!

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.910
But it was too low and a bit short.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.700
Stop being picky! I'm not a setter!

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.440
I think we might actually be able to pull off a Sky Love Hurricane now!

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.000
Sure, you get to be the bottom.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.040
Huh?! You're the bottom, you dimwit!

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.680
That was a fluke. Don't let it get to you.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.310
Right!

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.020
That may've been a fluke, but there's no denying that they're panicking.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.000
Yeah.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.650
That must feel awful.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.650
Not only did the tables turn on them, they then faced an unpredictable attack, so they must be panicked.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.870
I'm sure they'd like to alter the momentum of the match.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.350
At times like this, you'd feel so much better if you could get an epic one in.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.830
That'd also get your team's motivation up.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.100
We know you're gonna do all you can to land that spike,

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.260
and we're gonna do all we can...

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.220
to stop it.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.100
Shut down!

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.620
They managed to stop the ace, Azumane!

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:46.520
It seems like the orange guys... Inarizaki Karasuno

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.910
might actually lose at this rate.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.190
I put too much strength into it!

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.120
Sorry!

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.540
Guess he touched the net.
Lame.
Shut your mouth!

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.990
That's pretty lucky for them,

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.200
but the side that took a mental beating is Karasuno.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.620
We got lucky, and now we can catch up!

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.200
Right!

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.370
Damn it...

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:08.210
I'd been able to ignore Inarizaki's cheer squad, but now they're getting to me again.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.810
Get out there, Shouyou!

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.580
Yeah!

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.180
And now, Karasuno's bringing middle blocker Hinata up to the front row.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:19.640
He's an excellent scorer and one of the best decoys out there,

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.990
Hinata...

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.050
so they'll hoping to score back-to-back points.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.070
Hinata, do something.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.600
Anything!

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.530
Asahi!

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.710
It's up! Keep it going!

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.320
Tanaka!

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.950
Inarizaki lost control of the ball...

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.780
but Ojiro Aran put everything he had into that one!

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.620
Tanaka!

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.470
Up front!

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.010
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.720
Inarizaki's blockers are also upping their game.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.320
Kageyama...

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.080
I'm gonna swallow my pride and ask you to do this.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.650
Hinata!

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.190
All right!

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.820
Nice spike!

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.110
And now, Kageyama's up to serve.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.280
You can do this, Kageyama!

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.280
Karasuno will probably want to score repeatedly here.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.860
Their number nine has a powerful serve.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.910
In the front row, they've got three attackers, including number ten.
Kageyama, go for it!

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.960
This is the most annoying rotation.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.590
Time to score!

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.450
It's because this rotation's so annoying...

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.930
that we won't let them score here!

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.970
Nice receive!

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:45.850
It's long!

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.650
A dump!

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.610
I'm gonna stop him!

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.050
Yes!

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.830
Wh-Why are they getting a point?!

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.040
That was a reach over.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.660
What?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.000
Hinata and Tanaka probably thought they blocked Miya Atsumu's dump,

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.340
but Miya Atsumu was actually trying to set.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.240
They're not allowed to touch the ball when it's still in the opponent's court.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.470
You baited him into doing that.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.990
The ones who dominate the net aren't the big guys or the middle blockers.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.610
It's the ones who reign over this territory: the setters.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.270
Inarizaki Karasuno Inarizaki Karasuno

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:33.520
Inarizaki Inarizaki Inarizaki

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.070
Inarizaki Inarizaki

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:43.910
And now, the rotation brings back Inarizaki's most powerful server, Miya Atsumu.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.620
Will Karasuno be able to survive?

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.890
Whoa! That ball went right back over to Inarizaki's court!

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.820
Damn it.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.850
Nice receive!
Karasuno survives a little longer!

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.430
The orange guys just seem to be barely hanging on now.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.550
Yeah...

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.370
Kick some ass out there, Tsukishima!

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.430
Damn it.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.990
Now their setter's in the back, meaning the twins' fast attack is probably on the menu again.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.880
Keep your blocking game up!

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.040
That receive is going right to the setter. Who's Miya Atsumu going to use?

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.090
It comes from the left with Ginjima!

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.260
Yes!

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.220
But Karasuno's wall, Tsukishima, isn't gonna let that happen!

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.520
Go again!
Got it!

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.430
Osamu!

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.820
Miya Atsumu skips the pass and sets the ball!

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.280
That's insane, Tsumu.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.660
Tsukishima's on point.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.410
The ball's waiting for Miya Osamu!

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.500
What?!

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.050
Miya Osamu sets the ball that was set to him!

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.420
Karasuno's blockers totally fell for that one!

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.640
Damn it... And coming from the back...

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.810
is Ojiro Aran!

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.920
Every once in a while,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.850
in a period of time that feels long and filled with exhaustion,

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.600
you might see something like this, though only very rarely.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.560
Just thinking about it gets your heart racing,

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.440
and you can feel your confidence coming back.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:26.490
During a long, strenuous climb to the top of the mountain, it serves as the foothold that you desperately needed.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.660
It's not a miracle.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.920
Maybe it happens one out of a hundred times, or even one out of a thousand,

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.050
but it's the one you went to reach and managed to grab.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.420
By grabbing and connecting these rare moments,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.670
you're able to keep climbing higher and higher.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.300
I never thought the day would come where I'd say this to you.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.640
Nice receive!

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.990
I'm going on ahead.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.070
Don't panic too much.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.320
Also, don't go underestimating what it takes to be a ball boy.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.860
Without that setter, Kageyama,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.580
I can't say that I sense any worth in you.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.170
"To go a distance we must first traverse the space that is near."

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.850
What are you even doing?

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:40.980
Haikyuu!!

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:33.970


00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.400
The set's a bit low.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.260
He's struggling with his approach.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.870
A straight spike's not being blocked.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:12.220
Despite their libero not being present, their middle blocker Hinata Shouyou managed to get that powerful attack up!

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.220
Faculty Office Faculty Office

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.180
What a nice receive!

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.900
A fluke?

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.370
I mean, I guess you could call it that,

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:21.830
but they can't all be flukes.

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:26.150
I mean... Wait, what exactly is a fluke?

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.960
There was concentrated intent behind his actions.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.290
The moment he made contact with the ball,

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:42.170
he used his whole body to kill the ball's velocity, then sent it up high, gently spinning.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.460
It's per—

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.340
No, I'm not gonna say it! I'm not gonna say it yet!

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.850
Counterattack!

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.340
Go! Let's score!

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.510
Full-team synchronized attack!

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.980
It may be a single point, but it's one that we can't let them get!

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.940
It's gonna turn the match in a direction we don't want!

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.940
Stop them!

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.530
Get it!

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.760
Three blockers!

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.910
Nice wipe!

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.290
He's so fast! What's with him?!

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.050
Kageyama!

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.770
Nice spike!

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.980
It's still in the air!

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.490
Can Inarizaki send it back over?

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:53.450
They can!
Back up! Back up!

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.160
Let's go!
Go again!

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.490
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.420
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.460
Yeah!

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.920
It wasn't back-to-back points.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.570
It wasn't even a point that gives us the match point.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.430
But even then,

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:23.300
that point was more than enough to shatter their spirits.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.860
Once that happens, their bodies suddenly remember all the exhaustion that's been piling up.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.070
Sir.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:41.280
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.150
That was an amazing rally where neither side wanted to give up,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.560
but it appears as though the goddess of victory is still smiling upon Inarizaki!

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:47.320
It was just barely, but having those two huge attacks come back at them must've hurt.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.650
That was so close.

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:49.250
Yeah.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.980
I don't want to lose.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.750
We can't lose.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.450
I'm not gonna let it end like this!

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.030
We're not—

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.140
Did you see that?!

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.180
My receive was sick!

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.150
Nope.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.150
You lie!

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.280
Just so you know, I heard you say, "Nice receive!"

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.170
Now, just watch me get the next one!

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.460
It hurts.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.160
I just want to stop.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.460
This is when you get over those feelings and take that first step.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.220
It's like he's havin' a good meal.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.450
Seriously, what the hell?

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.360
Why do you keep thinking about food this match?

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:05.100
It's like when you eat too much barbecue, feel sick, swear you won't eat any for a while,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.650
but then you want some the very next day.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.750
Actually, I prefer to have curry or sushi after barbecue.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.870
Despite eating multiple times a day, you instantly get hungry.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.970
And every time you eat, you feel happy.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:23.260
And no matter how many times you experience it, that feeling of happiness never goes away.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:29.050
I guess you do always look like you're super happy to be alive when you eat.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:32.550
Even if you're eating cold rice balls or soggy ramen.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.110
That's what's going on with him, though.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.350
He's playing volleyball like I eat my food.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.910
Tsumu, did you know?

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.220
If you have a bite when you're starving,

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.250
you just get hungrier.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.050
Yeah, I get it.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.470
When you see someone enjoyin' their food so much...

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.390
everyone else gets hungry too.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:21.990


00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.880
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:35.630
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:52.310
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:58.820
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:04.820
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:10.830
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.540
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.380
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:28.390
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:34.140
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:40.320
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:51.990
