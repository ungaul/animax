WEBVTT

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.920
Hey.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.400
Yeah?

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.870
Come with me for a sec.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.830
Don't do a double take.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.820
C-Come with you?

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.340
For what?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.490
Blocking practice.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.090
You're allowed to do other things than pick up balls if we're practicing on our own, right?

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.350
I'm not going to force you—

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.810
Tsukki's joining in!

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.560
Thanks for joining in.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.820
All right!

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.680
Why don't you put those away first?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.340
Oh.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.030


00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.330
Clench your fists tight enough to leave marks

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.950
Now, go bask in the orange glow

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.300
!
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu !
Haikyuu

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:23.430
Sweating harder than ever has led us to the unknown territory of this high stage

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.560
The crowd's on their side and our chances are slim, so we could just skip out

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.440
But if the fear of getting hurt is keeping your wings in check

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.450
You may as well be a stuffed bird

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.160
If a person tries to live their life swallowing their dreams and passions

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.870
They'll be torn by the heartbreak

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.920
But our goosebumps just won't go away

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.840
Our very souls are burning bright Beyond our limits

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.020
Awaits a land Of thrilling competition

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.380
Unleash everything you've got

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.730
Winning or losing doesn't even seem to matter

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.900
When you're in the zone and everything flows

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.520
In glorious slow-motion Now, go all-out!

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:22.990


00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.170
Episode Four: "Easy"

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.210
Man, I feel so much better when there's someone I know around.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.240
Broccoli #1.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.970
And #2.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.280
He's been hard to get along with since the summer training camp,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.280
but I can't even tell what he's thinking.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.570
You guys at Karasuno beat Shiratorizawa and are going to nationals, right?

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.460
Yeah.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.910
That's awesome.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.370
My team lost in five sets in the finals.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.330
I was sure we'd win too.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.070
Hey.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.330
Sakusa!

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.050
I haven't seen the video yet,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.510
but why did Shiratorizawa lose?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.720
Was Wakatoshi not at his best?

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.220
He seemed to be playing his best to me.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.640
What?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.010
Then why the hell did he lose?

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.570
How did you manage that?

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.480
Did someone actually manage to stop Wakatoshi?

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.110
Yeah, they did.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.570
Though in Hinata's case, it was basically a receive.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.000
Who was it? What grade are they in? What's their name?

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.500
What junior high—
Sorry about that!

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.920
He's as negative as you can get.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.620
He has to know everything about anyone who could be a threat to him.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.360
I'm not negative. I'm just cautious.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.390
You haven't actually gotten serious yet, have you, Sakusa?

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.370
What makes you say that?

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.590
It's just a feeling.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.770
I mean, you're way more normal than what I imagined you'd be like.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.380
Right now, he thinks his shoulders aren't doing so great.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.040
Though in his case, it's usually just in his head.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.250
I guess there's nothing bad about being cautious when it comes to that stuff.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.590
Bath time.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.250
Already?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.460
I'm taking one before anyone else can fill the tub with their germs.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.950
Sorry to bug you guys!

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.250
Man, that scared me!

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.390
I can't believe you called one of the top three aces in Japan "normal"!

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.110
I said he seems normal so far.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.270
Everyone here's crazy good.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.740
Especially him.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.800
I wonder who he is.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.510
But you know, this training camp...

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.420
It's weird that we're even holding it.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.130
I think Coach Washijou's trying to change.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.860
If he wasn't, he wouldn't have given a second thought to this camp,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.100
and he wouldn't have allowed you to be the primary instructor, Anabara.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.070
Coach Washijou has been a bit different ever since we played Karasuno.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:48.570
Fried Noodles Crispy Seafood Noodles
Ham Cutlets French Fries Pork Soup
Oyster Miso Soup.... Fried Oysters..
Steamed Oysters... Half Shell Raw Oysters..
Oysters Oysters

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.540
Is he worried about Karasuno's number ten?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.570
Well, he definitely knows that he exists.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.520
When Karasuno's number ten scored the final point in the finals,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.540
Coach Washijou's face was rather unforgettable.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.350
Of course, he obviously seemed upset,

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.400
but at the same time...

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.690
Thanks for waiting!

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.520
Here're your raw oysters!

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.390
They're finally here!

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.560
Hey, don't eat too many.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.160
Remember the teacher who got sick from oysters when we were in high school?

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.080
And then we had to keep practicing on our own the next day, right?

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.230
That sure takes me back.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.880
Left!

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.730
You're not a libero, Hinata?

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.760
Huh?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.240
Do I actually look like a libero?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.190
Do I look like I'm good at receiving?!

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.870
Nah, not really.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.840
Oh, that so?!

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.300
I'll block too.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.860
Two middle blockers?!

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.870
If you're gonna spike, I'm gonna stuff it right back in your face.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.460
Me too!

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.800
Seriously?!

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:31.040
I believe it's my turn I'll stop you!

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.410
Yeah!

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:43.990
Damn it.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.150
Am I the shortest now?

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.450
Nice location!

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.220
That was someone's fault for leaving the edge open.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.870
The straight spike was wide open.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.500
Well, I was positive that he was gonna do a cross-court spike!

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.420
Yeah.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.340
I also thought that was going to be a cross-court spike.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.640
He even angled his approach like he was going to do one.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.930
He really is good.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.780
I heard this guy hasn't been playing volleyball that long, but he's from Date Tech.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.470
I guess I shouldn't be surprised he's not jumping randomly.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.190
Hey, Tsukishima.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:35.170
Could it be that you were just saying you wanted to practice blocking so I can have a chance to spike?

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.300
Nope.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.580
Right. Of course not.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.860
Once we start playing against those top-level teams at nationals,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.540
the tactics between the blockers and spikers are going to become even more complex.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.880
Yura!
Yes?

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.980
I'll set next!

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.540
Okay.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.900
Setting tactics aside,

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.080
I can't deny the fact that Hinata is a spiker that can actually see the blockers.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.760
Of course I'm going to practice against that.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.290
Got it!

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.060
Nice spike!

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.390
You don't need to focus so hard on hitting a target if you're just going to pass right over the net.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.460
Yes, sir.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.740
Setter, you can stand a little further away from the net.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.070
Yes, sir!

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.680
Nice spike!

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.040
Kageyama didn't have any problem syncing together with that left-handed middle blocker.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.800
His technique and instinct are both wonderful.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.080
How was that?

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.950
I think I could hit it sooner.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.800
Could you make it a bit more compact and zippy?

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.720
Got it.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.050
It's terrifying that this kid can agree to that so quickly and actually follow through.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.270
Um, could you keep passing like that?

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.280
Got it.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:02.370
I'm pretty sure Kageyama's not the best at communicating, but you can tell that he's definitely trying.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.870
Up front!

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.210
Nice!

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:09.710
Left!

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.190
Talk about a high jump...

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.110
Great job. That was right on the end line.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.000
Make sure you're properly stretching.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:57.550
Hey.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.820
Have you seen me before?

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.810
Yeah, since I came here.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.280
That's not what I meant!

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.810
I'm asking you if you've seen any of my matches before.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:12.960
No.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.820
Someone's trying to pick a fight with Kageyama again.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.230
I see.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.800
Then be more scared of me! Be surprised!

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.240
You've just been giving me a dumb look ever since you saw me!

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.160
Usually people underestimate me because of my height...

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.790
and then freak out when they see my skills!

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.480
That's how this is usually supposed to work!

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.460
And apparently there's another annoying guy to put up with.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.310
You do freak me out.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.390
But...

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.350
I can learn a lot from you.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.060
What?!

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.360
Wow, you've got guts.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.080
That guy's a setter and second-year.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.080
Miya Atsumu.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:05.410
I actually thought you were gonna be pretty prickly at first,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.470
but on the court...

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.160
you're a Goody Two-Shoes, aren't ya?

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:13.630
What?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:32.980
Haikyuu!!

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:25.970


00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.340
Here's your drink!

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.280
Thanks.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.200
Huh? Where's my... Here's your towel!

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.480
Oh, that's right! I put it over there.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.650
Thanks!

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.860
You sure are observant, Shouyou.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.680
Whoops, it really went up there. I'll go get—

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.970
I'll go get it!

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.910
Thanks.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.770
Watching them play from up here is my thing lately.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.160
Kunimi's receives look like Ushiwaka's.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.130
He doesn't make unnecessary movements.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.250
Hyakuzawa!

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.290
Someone get that!

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.810
Or maybe he just doesn't want to move.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.670
He totally just watched it fall.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.470
Come on! Let's take this seriously!

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.460
You totally could've gotten that!

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.060
We're playing together with guys we can't play with usually!

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.980
Let's go all-out!

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:03.980
Kunimi Akira Kunimi Akira Kunimi Akira

Second least favorite phrase:

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.980
"Go all-out."
"Go all-out."
"Go all-out."

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.300
Uh, sorry about that.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.850
I promise that he does try sometimes.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.000
Come on, Kunimi! You should've gone after that one!

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.490
Sure.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.590
All right. Go get rehydrated and we'll do two-on-two drills.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.400
I don't like that guy.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.010
You mean Kunimi?

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.590
Everyone here is doing their best, so why's he so unmotivated?

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.900
He likes to conserve his energy.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.230
Then he gets super serious in the latter half of a match when it's hard to deal with.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.010
But I mean, he should go after any balls he can get.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.190
Right?! He's taking it way too easy!

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.520
"Easy," huh?

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.420
Two-on-two, huh?

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.420
These drills are the roughest.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.010
Yeah, because if there's only two of us, we have to keep moving nonstop.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.630
But the one who has it the hardest is that guy over there,

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.360
since he has the least experience.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:18.640
I don't want to be that guy, but I'd rather not be with the guy who's two meters tall.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.460
Yeah. He's tall, but his technique is still at the junior high level.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.660
It's hard trying to pick up after him.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:27.740
Gather 'round!

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.290
The rules are the same.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.730
When you're spiking, no softly hitting it with the tips of your fingers.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.620
First to get ten points wins.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.410
I know I've said this before, but always think about your next move.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.630
You're not going to be able to win this if you're half-assing it.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.630
Yes, sir!

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.050
Kunimi &amp; Kawashita         Kindaichi &amp; Koganegawa

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:50.920
Got it!

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.890
Damn it...

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.310
Screw you! Screw you, Kunimi!

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.020
Whenever they do two-on-twos, Kunimi's team is always really good.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:15.660
He really is talented, and I think he's always observing who he's playing with.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.650
But that's not the only thing. What else is he doing?

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.720
It feels like his team has more time.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.000
Got it!

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.400
He's really staring at me.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.680
Hyakuzawa!

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.070
This feeling of being left further and further behind...

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.770
I can tell my level of play is getting worse.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.410
Since there are only two of us, it's hard to do any kind of complicated attack.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.040
So you just need to watch the other guy and pounce on his mistakes.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.240
And...

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.550
I know that I'm making a bunch of mistakes.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.500
But just realizing that...

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.140
isn't going to magically make me be able to keep up.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.260
I can't wait for this two-on-two match to hurry up and be over!

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.970
Hyakuzawa &amp; Oda            Shibata &amp; Yura

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.940
Here's your water.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.690
I wish you were the one invited here instead of me.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.450
How stupid can I be?!

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.490
He obviously feels that way more than anyone else!

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:51.160
He's a starter for a powerhouse team, and everyone here who's been up against him is watching his every move.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.110
Unlike me, who just happens to be here,

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.870
he's the kind of guy who makes people want to pick him.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.700
Hey, now.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.100
You mean you wish it was me and you who got invited here, right?

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:13.590
Everyone who's been invited here's pretty amazing in one way or another, and I mean, you're super huge and tall.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.360
And I admit, without Kageyama, I'm just a little—

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.470
emphasis on the "little"—

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.160
inconvenienced, and I can't quite display everything I've got.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.870
But even then... But I'm just huge.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.320
Hey!

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.080
What do you mean, "just"?!

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.510
Do you... Do you realize how cool two meters is?!

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.660
If I could pick between having a killer serve and being two meters tall right now,

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.770
I'd definitely pick being two meters tall!

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.400
I mean, I can always work on my serve, but there's nothing I can do about my height!

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.060
Anyway!

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.520
Being two meters tall is the best...

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.730
The most ultimate...

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.050
The most amazingly awesome super talent there is!

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.810
Cheering up a rival? You must be confident.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.310
The heck are you talking about?!

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.800
I'm chewing him out!

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.720
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're cheering him up.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.660
Huh?

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.060
Really?

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.330
I mean, I guess that's fine in the end.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.670
What good does it do you to cheer me up?

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.090
Lots! I mean...

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.290
I wanna beat you.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.670
Hey, there's something that I noticed when I was watching you guys play.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.080
Could you try something for me?

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.420
I won't be able to do anything that requires a lot of technique.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.530
It's super easy!

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.200
I'm sure you'll be able to do it!

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.790
Hyakuzawa &amp; Kuroishi         Kunimi &amp; Nagamatsu

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:50.750
Finish it off!

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.540
Up front!

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:57.800
The back...

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.260
is wide open!

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.390
He can actually reach that?

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.890
Let's take it easy, Hyakuzawa!

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.520
It's so simple and trivial.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.950
But it's also really easy to forget in a chaotic match.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:33.750
Volleyball is a sport where you can't hold the ball or let it drop.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:38.040
But when you or your teammates are out of sorts,

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.170
you can always try to make time for yourselves.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.680
And when you deliberately take it easy and pass...

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.180
Got it!

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.080
...the teammate you're passing it to gets to take it easy too.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.060
I won't be able to do anything that requires a lot of technique.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.390
It's super easy!

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.030
I'm sure you'll be able to do it!

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.910
All you have to do is make the first pass as high as possible.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.570
Like Kunimi does.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.540
Just by doing that, the fast and stressful rhythm of the match will get a little easier.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.500
And just by getting your rhythm back a little, then...

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.710
Hit it over!

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.540
...you'll be able to do all sorts of things!

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.620
There's no way I can win head-to-head with a giant that's two meters tall.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:44.240
Hyakuzawa &amp; Kuroishi Hyakuzawa &amp; Kuroishi

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.240
Man, you're so big! I'm so jealous, damn it!

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.710
Hey, Hyakuzawa!

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.120
Nice spike, hey!

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.460
Kunimi &amp; Tsukishima           Oda &amp; Kawashita

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.030
Now there's another one staring at me.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.720
All right, go ahead and do your stretches, and then head on out.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.380
Yes, sir!

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:21.940


00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.040
So what if the pressure's on?

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:46.270
I don't need any help from on high

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.340
So what if I'm an egotist?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.430
I just want to win, I don't have a reason why

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.830
I'll take on every challenge

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.160
I'll throw off any shadows of doubt

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:07.530
This is my chance to overcome my limits

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.360
I've gone all-out Conquered my fears

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.620
Turned them into conviction

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:20.080
Now fly high, higher, higher, to the top

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.710
Being so torn at the taste of defeat

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.560
Shed the tears that let our potential flower

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.880
If you try to give up, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.480
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.190
If you say it's too hard, I'll just laugh it off

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:50.630
I don't know the meaning of the phrase

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:51.910
