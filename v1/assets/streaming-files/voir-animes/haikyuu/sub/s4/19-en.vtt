00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.240
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.870
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.660
Nishinoya!

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.430
All right!

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.630
I knew it... Yeah...

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.600
Miya Atsumu has been targeting Nishinoya ever since the start of the second set.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.840
It looks like all the servers are deliberately trying to avoid Nishinoya.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.770
This is probably the first time Nishinoya's ever felt...

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.800
the humiliation of being targeted.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.030


00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.830
Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu Haikyuu

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.050
Haikyuu !
!
Haikyuu

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.310
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.180
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.560
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.850
'Cause if we give up now It'll all be over

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.340
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.870
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.540
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.480
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.120
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.630
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.310
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.230
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.230
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.760
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.630
So let's start smiling

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:15.990


00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.950
Miyagi Karasuno Miyagi Karasuno

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.040
Episode Nineteen: The Ultimate Challengers

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.160
Chikara, could you tape me up?

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.920
I suck at it.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.280
Oh, sure.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.480
Did you sprain your finger?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.420
You okay?

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.270
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.130
Inarizaki's number seven has an intense serve.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.340
Yeah. And he's going after the libero, who can only defend.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.340
Oh?

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.820
That libero's really good and full of energy.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.450
If they crush him, that team's in trouble.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.350
Really?

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.870
"There's no way we can get balls that even our libero can't get."

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.990
That's probably what Miya Atsumu is thinking, so he's putting pressure on them that way.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.290
It always feels great when you get a service ace against a strong opponent.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.360
There he goes.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.610
Huh? What?

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.220
Atsumu is amazingly, incredibly thoughtless at times.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.260
Huh?! That's so rude!

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.550
All right!

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.930
Don't give up, Nishinoya.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.630
Give us a good serve!
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.350
Four steps...

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.480
So it's going to be a jump floater.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.440
Miya Atsumu manages to get back-to-back service aces against their libero!

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.400
It totally looked like he got that.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.910
The ball's path seemed to change right in front of him.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.080
When doing an underhanded pass, you don't have much leeway.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.690
If the point where it hits is just a bit off, the ball ricochets at a weird angle.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.780
Yeah, totally!

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.520
I've never seen Nishinoya fail two serve receives in a row.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.340
Volleyball isn't a sport where you can finish things off on your own.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.970
If you can't get the first receive up, nothing's gonna get going.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.190
That's why the emotional damage from missing a serve receive is huge.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.730
Not to mention, if the libero, who's in charge of defense, can't defend,

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.220
there's no point in him being on the court.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.790
I can't count how many times Nishinoya's cheered me up.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.220
I've got your backs.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.450
What am I supposed to say to him?

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.590
Noya—

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720
The hell?
What's he doing?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.760
The finger push-ups from practice we get as a punishment.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.900
Nishinoya's doing his best to stay calm right now.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.830
That guy's the best.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.010
Yes!

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.880
Keep it going!

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.590
Get it!

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.880
That was a weak receive!

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.630
Asahi!

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.020
I'm not gonna be able to hit it that hard.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.650
He went for the setter!

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.610
The first to touch the ball is Miya Atsumu!

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.670
At the same time, Miya Osamu is right under the ball!

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.440
He's not even a setter and he pulled off a C set?!

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.240
On a counterattack too!

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.000
He's covering for his twin.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.830
I can get this.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.210
Got him.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.010
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories
The one who just got the ball up wasn't the setter.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.970
It was Miya Osamu!
Nice spike.
Nice set.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.390
What was that just now?

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.800
He totally had that block.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.400
Don't worry.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.470
You're a great blocker.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.710
Jackass.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.370
Inarizaki Karasuno They got another one.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.460
What's up with Suna?

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.630
He wasn't standing out much on offense at first, but is he getting into his groove now?

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.250
Rintarou starts off slow.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.880
And I'll have you know...

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.090
he knows how to control the opposing team's blockers.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.260
Rintarou's weapon is his wide range on where he can hit the ball.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.270
If a normal guy's range is about this much,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.060
Rintarou's is about this much.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.770
When he spikes, he doesn't just use his arm or his shoulder.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.280
He uses his whole upper body.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.890
His core.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.430
Since he uses his whole upper body, his spikes stay powerful.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.250
It's completely different from just lightly tapping on the ball.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.050
I'm not sure I understand completely, but basically, when he's about to get blocked,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.960
he somehow gets through the block.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.570
It's happened a few times.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.880
Oh, and what's this about him controlling the blockers?

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.390
Just watch.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.610
Out!

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.580
Damn it!

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.040
All right! Asahi, get a nice serve in!
Why are you all sad that I messed up?

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.870
Fire it up, fire it up, Karasuno!

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.810
Inarizaki Karasuno Get it, get it, Karasuno!

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.760
Fire it up, fire it up, Karasuno!

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.010
Get it, get it, Karasuno!

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.270
Aran!

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.630
Yes!

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.220
That was a powerful service ace!

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.500
Sorry.
Focus on the next one.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:59.730
Karasuno hasn't been doing their best with serves in the second set, so hopefully they can turn things around here.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.110
Aran!

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.830
Go! Block that ball, Tsukki!

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.000
Two blockers!

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.550
Well done.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:39.080
Nice spike, Rintarou! Yes, yes, Rintarou! Do it again!

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.060
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.980
The better the blockers are,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.390
the easier it is for Suna to control them.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:10:04.000
Haikyuu!!

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:56.990


00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.850
Well, did you see that?

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:17.970
Huh? What?

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.090
Inarizaki Karasuno Inarizaki Karasuno

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.390
Inarizaki Inarizaki Inarizaki

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.190
Did you figure it out?

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.020
Their number ten looked totally ready to hit a cross-court spike.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.440
Tsukki immediately reacted to that and tried to block him off,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.910
and Kageyama also immediately jumped in to support him.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.370
However,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.330
his approach and the way his body's facing are both diversions.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.750
He lures the blockers into thinking he's doing a cross-court spike, then does the opposite midair.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.210
And he does all this without losing any power to his spikes.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.490
Fast attacks from middle blockers usually end up more compact than other attacks.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.860
They're usually quick enough to get through the blockers.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:04.290
But Rintarou can use his fast attack to go head-to-head against the blockers once the set goes up.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.310
Man, nationals is scary.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.320
We just need to get them off their game so they can't use their fast attacks!

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.400
We need to go all-out with our serves and spikes!

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.570
Yeah!

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.440
Nishinoya!

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.540
Nice receive!

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.170
Another powerful serve!

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.130
The fact that he managed to get it up is amazing too.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.130
I touched it! Someone get it!

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.420
Left!

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.090
Three blockers!

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.140
That was an intense spike from Ojiro Aran!

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.590
The ball is right above the net!

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.440
Akagi!
Kageyama pushes it in!

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.980
Left!

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.700
Here comes Ojiro Aran from the left again!

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.690
Stop him!

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.650
No slacking!

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.490
Three blockers!

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.000
That spike got past the three blockers and packed a punch!

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.500
It might've gone above the block. That was high!

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.380
But now, Karasuno has a chance to fight back, and—

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.680
Yeah!

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.120
Ojiro Aran slams it into their court!

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.680
He managed to get three spikes over in less-than-ideal situations.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.150
He truly tore through for that point!

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:34.080
Nice spike, Aran! Jump, jump, Aran! Do it again!

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.860
Inarizaki Karasuno

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.780
Not yet, sir.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.360
That was clearly our mistake. Our boys know that.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.080
More importantly, we don't want to let Ojiro Aran rest for even 30 seconds right now.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.350
Yeesh.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.950
Their number four reminds me of Ushiwaka.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.750
What makes him different from Ushiwaka is that he's actually receiving serves.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.000
Meaning they can aim their serves at him,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.010
and they've actually gotten quite a few service aces against him.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.600
That's definitely stressing him out a bit.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.720
And there are plenty of difficult sets going up, followed by a bunch of solid blocks.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.520
His exhaustion and irritation are definitely brewing, as they should be.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.980
Or so I think!

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.730
Sorry, get it!

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.660
Tanaka!

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.540
Yeah!

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.500
Ryuu, you're so badass!

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:32.220
Fly Fly Tanaka Ryunosuke from Karasuno High School!

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.920
Good job, Tanaka!

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.960
He's breaking through Inarizaki's obvious advantage with that one!

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.420
And now, Karasuno High School is going to bring in Sugawara, a third-year.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.140
I'll avenge Nishinoya.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.890
I'm not dead!

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.650
Sugawara's going in to replace Tsukishima.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.500
Which probably means that Kinoshita won't be serving.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.240
That was my 25th service ace in my visual training.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.200
Hey!

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.200
We took the first set,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.660
but you guys aren't actually thinking that we can let them have the second set, are you?!

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.880
We're winning this in straight sets!

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.380
Yeah!

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.800
Jaybird Inn Jaybird Inn

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.800
I want you to put as much pressure on Ojiro Aran as possible.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.440
With blocks, of course, but more importantly with serves.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.430
I definitely won't complain if you get service aces off of him,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.930
but the ideal is to get him to fall to one knee.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.410
Even if I'm only on the court for ten or twenty seconds...

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.240
Even five seconds...

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.790
I'm going to annoy the hell out of Inarizaki!

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.160
Up front!

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.560
That was a rather risky serve for Karasuno's Sugawara!

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.550
Osamu!

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.560
Kageyama, finish it off!

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.640
Left!

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.890
All right!

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.390
It's a bit low.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.870
Aran, calm down!

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:31.750
Yessir!

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.250
This time Inarizaki is using their pinch server.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.110
The first-year, Riseki Heisuke.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.010
I spent all three years of junior high on the bench.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.220
The one time I came on as a pinch server, I messed up my serve and that was it.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.380
You got this!
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.690
There's no point if I don't land this.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.390
I have to start...

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:57.510
by making this first serve.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.270
Well, Riseki definitely got the ball into the court.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.200
Asahi!
Got it!

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.910
Hell yeah!

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.870
We don't need the memories
We don't need the memories

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.010
What the hell was that serve?!

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.170
Why are you even here?!

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.880
No one asked you to just give them the ball!

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.000
Wow, I haven't heard this in a while.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.550
What is this?

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.860
Booing? They're booing their own side?

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.830
But he didn't mess up the serve, did he?

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.260
What is this?

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.040
Inarizaki's brutal critiques.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.760
I heard that if you make a shitty play, their cheer squad gives you an earful.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.690
You're probably hearing it now.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:42.730
Really?

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.730
That's pretty mean, considering he's not even a pro.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.100
This is why I told you to take that chance.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.630
You always think too hard about this.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.520
We don't need a guy who just gets the serve over the net on our team.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.090
Whether we're in the lead or not doesn't matter.

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:06.490
Right.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.220
Fly Fly

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.700
A service ace!

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.690
That speed! That location!

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.990
No one was gonna be able to touch that one.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.090
That's...

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.920
Calmeyama.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.940
The hell are you talking about?

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.800
I think it's pretty self-explanatory, but it's a calm Kageyama.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.710
Like when I'm able to do fast attacks without closing my eyes,

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.320
or when he got Tsukishima's point of impact higher.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.780
Times like that.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.440
It's basically when he's in the most tip-top shape.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.730
But it's only his face that's calm.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.810
He's still as harsh as ever, so you need to proceed with caution.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.880
This tends to happen a lot when facing a powerful foe.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.660
At some point, you turned into an instruction manual.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.410
The air is really prickly.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.840
Inarizaki High School is calling their first timeout.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.800
We don't need the memories We don't need the memories
But wow, both sides have some really powerful serves.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.510
Fly Fly
Both schools have a variety of attacks that are very powerful.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.730
If they don't get aggressive with their serves and stop the other team's fast attacks,
Just keep pressing the attack like you have been. Don't falter on receiving, either.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.010
the other side will definitely get a point.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.080
I'm sure you're all tired about now, but so are they.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.690
We've got the momentum on our side right now.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:51.130
Will Kageyama's serves turn the tables around for Karasuno?

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.130
Make sure you concentrate.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.110
Right!

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:05.960
Yes!

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.170
All right!
He lands another one!

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.090
That timeout sure didn't kill his concentration!

Miya Atsumu Miya Atsumu Seriously?

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.680
Do it again!

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:21.720
Gin!

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.870
Aran!

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.870
Even if we can't totally break them down mentally,

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.730
just the slightest annoyance should do it.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.900
If they hit aggressive spikes toward us even a little...

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.900
Left, left!

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.410
Three blockers!

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.630
...that'll give us a huge chance for a turnaround.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.700
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.840
Here it comes!

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.050
Oh, hey. Is that... Yeah...

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.300
That was annoyingly just out of bounds.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.480
Fire it up, fire it up, Karasuno!
Fly Fly

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.220
Damn it!

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.360
And the ball is sailing right back over to Karasuno's side.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.450
Too damn fast!

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.160
Don't go getting a big head, now.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:29.750
Samu!

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.050
Yeah!

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.510
Ojiro Aran certainly landed that one!

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.970
He's making his presence known as the ace!

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.460
Atsumu's dig was amazing.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:49.420
Both Kageyama Tobio and Miya Atsumu are candidates for the national youth team and excellent setters.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.110
You can see the sparks fly even when they're not setting.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.260
Osamu! Put the finisher on this second set already!

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.630
Also, I definitely got way more service aces than you today!

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.820
Would you shut up?

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.200
Shit.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.700
Inarizaki Inarizaki Inarizaki

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.120
Inarizaki

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.080
That was a little too powerful and definitely went out of bounds!

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.090
That really flew!

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.860
You don't need to hit a home run here!

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.270
It's not like you haven't done that before!

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.100
It's because you provoked him.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.060
Ow!

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.360
Osamu looks pretty calm, but he hates losing.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.270
Well, think about who his other half is.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.460
Even the slightest wavering of their mental strength...

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.740
will throw them off their usual plays just a bit.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.990
Then irregularities start to pile up.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:43.890
It's in!

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:44.990
Gin!

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.690
And that changes the flow.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.400
Sorry!
It's fine!

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.650
It's all good, Asahi.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:08.200
Sorry!

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.930
Let's get our rhythm back.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.140
Let's calm down.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.950


00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:28.840
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:35.590
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:52.280
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:58.780
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:04.780
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:10.790
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.500
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:22.340
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:28.350
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:34.100
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:40.270
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.950
