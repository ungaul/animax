00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.250
Yeah.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.900
Connect Nekoma?

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.090
Left!

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.260
Kenma!

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.980
Keep Standing Back Up
That was a rather difficult position for a fast attack,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.940
but Sarukawa Tech manages to dig it out!

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.900
The Tokyo reps, Nekoma High,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.570
and the Ishikawa reps, Sarukawa Tech.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.070
Both teams are known for their unbreakable defense.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.940
Which team's defense will see them through...

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.280
to the third round?!

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.960

Haikyuu

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.230
We're not gonna quit now, we're not stopping here, we're not giving up

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.110
We're in the direst of straits We understand all that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.490
But we're not quitting now, we're not stopping, we're not giving up

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.780
'Cause if we give up now It'll all be over

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.270
If we don't step up to the challenge, we'll never get a taste

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.800
Of the most exhilarating time of our lives

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.470
There's always been something we've lacked, something missing

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.410
Haven't you also hungered for it?

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.050
So we'll be coming at them fair and square

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.560
We're gonna play out this reality, all the sweet and all the sour

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.240
We wanna come straight at you with the greatest of finesse

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.160
We're torn toward that delight because that seems like the most fun

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.170
So there's no way we're giving up now

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.690
Not until we've tasted it all and are left grinning

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.560
So let's start smiling

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.010


00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.180
Episode Seventeen: Cats vs. Monkeys

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.970
Our first time at nationals...

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.270
I wish we could've actually traveled somewhere for it. Like, actually got on the bullet train.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.790
Next year... No, wait, this year.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.570
Where's the interhigh this year?

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.510
If it's far away, let's go cheer them on.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.920
You're already assuming they'll make it.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.280
Let's believe in our juniors.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.700
Speak of the devil.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.320
Right?

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.410
Yeah, no way.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.670
Kenma hates being the center of attention, and yet we managed to drag him to nationals.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.320
It's going on sale next month, right?

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.870
He definitely doesn't look like an athlete competing in nationals.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.130
Yep. And the deck goes on sale the week after, right?

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.570
Man, I'm broke.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.120
What?!

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.170
A ghost?!

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.050
From the time he started playing volleyball, up until junior high...

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.720
Kenma would always come down with a fever on days practice was extra hard or right after our matches.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.190
I'd always feel kinda bad, considering I'm the one who dragged him into all of this.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.530
Nekoma Nohebi

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.200
But now that we've made it all the way to nationals,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.660
I thought he might finally feel it was worth all the trouble,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.410
or so I was hoping.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.910
I'm pretty sure Kenma couldn't care less about that.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.130
You really don't hold back, do you, Yaku?

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.590
Well, think about Kenma's personality.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.160
If he really hated it, he would've quit by now.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.330
Right?

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.280
Kenma! I told you, no video games before bed!

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.560
You'll mess up your sleep cycle!

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.900
Well, if I really want to quit, I will.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.100
But I guess I may've felt somewhat bad for Kuro.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.780
What?!

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.780
Even I worry about others sometimes.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.240
It's actually a bit of a surprise to hear you say that.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.320
I just said "somewhat."

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.960
There's no way I could spend hours practicing just because I felt bad about someone else.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.360
Not to mention, I wouldn't keep playing volleyball if I hated it.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.760
I just keep playing.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.390
I don't have a definite reason to keep playing, but I also don't have a reason to quit.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.620
Not having either is pretty normal.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.480
Indeed.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.900
That's some deep thinking.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.150
Don't make this sound difficult.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.200
I don't like sweating or being out of breath,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.440
but I don't mind leveling up.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.410
Night.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.640
Yeah, night.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.670
He doesn't have much stamina, but he's awkwardly persistent at times.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.670
And he's able to keep up at practice.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.930
Though he knows exactly when to slack.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.420
This makes me think about that one time you mentioned before.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.210
When he woke up super early.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.350
Oh...

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.090
Around 5 AM, the light in Kenma's room would always be on when he got in the habit of oversleeping.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.520
I thought he'd been up all night,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.650
but he tells me that he actually woke up early at 2 AM, all to play video games.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.500
His parents would throw away his games if he stayed up all night playing them,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.990
but he thought there wouldn't an issue if he just got up early.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.220
Of course, they found out, and he got in trouble anyway.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.690
I'm sure he could only pull that off because he likes them so much.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.290
But ever since we started practicing with Karasuno, he seems to be trying even harder.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.920
Yeah, I totally see that.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.790
He's always hanging out with the tiny kid from Karasuno.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.370
Even though they're total opposites.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.430
Well, it's not often that he's able to make friends.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.880
And I think he's also the rare real-life obstacle that Kenma actually wants to conquer.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.730
I'm pretty sure he wants to defeat Kenma too.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.200
Though Kenma probably wouldn't be too bothered if he got defeated, so it might not be worth the trouble.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.020
Come on, now.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.280
But you know, "Leveling up" is definitely a Kenma thing to say.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.790
Nekoma Grade School Nekoma Grade School

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.790
Thank you very much!

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.570
Wanna go level up?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.460
Yeah.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.960
Now's not the time to be thinking back fondly on your junior.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.130
Yakkun, have you ever heard of "feelings"?

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.170
Four more days of the spring tournament...

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.930
I'm going to stand out the most!

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.920
Excuse me?!

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.820
That's gonna be me!

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.060
I'm totally ready for some nice announcer lady to interview me.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.350
Shut up, astaxanthin face!

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.390
That's docosahexaenoic acid to you!
What're they arguing about?

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.360
Just eat your damn fish and sleep!
Who knows?

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.980
Better not get a stomachache after eating meat.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.760
Sorry about this.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.980
It's fine.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.120
Huh?! What'd you say?!

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.550
Well, astaxanthin is red, so it matches our team color.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.450
That's not what we're talking about here!

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.910
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.920
Sarukawa thought they had an opening, but Nekoma manages to dig it out!

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.130
Solid masters of defense that they are, Nekoma's not going to let the ball land on their side of the court that easily!

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.090
Fukunaga!

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:11.970
I touched it!

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.930
Sarukawa Tech is keeping the rally going!

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.820
Good job! Take your time attacking!

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:24.150
Apparently, Sarukawa Tech's coach, Shishio, was one of Coach Nekomata's former students.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.750
Correct.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.580
His team's tight defense may be due to everything he learned from his mentor.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.230
Something doesn't feel right.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.240
What do you mean?

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:47.420
It feels like Sarukawa Tech is deliberately avoiding scoring quickly.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.200
Why?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.250
Actually, from my perspective, their attacks seem pretty fast and violent.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:58.400
Yeah, sure, they've been scoring, and it's not like their attacks haven't been great.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.390
Nekoma can just dig them out because they're Nekoma.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:06.320
Nekoma has a high-level defense, and they're able to dig out attacks even when they seem flawless.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.610
And I'm not sure if that's why,

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:18.650
but it really seems like Sarukawa is trying to throw Nekoma off their rhythm rather than score.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.510
But what's the point if they can't score?

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.000
Well, their intention is probably...

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.720
to make Nekoma's setter run.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.780
Fukunaga!

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.720
Nice spike!

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.680
Connect

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.950
Nice, nice, Fukunaga! Nice, nice, Fukunaga! Do it again!

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:51.360
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:51.360
Even if we have to sacrifice the first set, put as much pressure on Nekoma's setter as you can.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.330
He doesn't seem like the type to break mentally, but the type that starts slipping up when he gets tired.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.290
We need to wear him down physically, not mentally.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.000
First, we need to take out...

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.010
Nekoma's brain.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:25.020
Haikyuu!!

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:18.010


00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.270
Keep up, first-year!

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.430
I hate running.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:42.960
But...

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:49.420
I do sorta like the scenery while I run, as well as what I think about.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.070
I got a power-up!

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.550
That ivy over there is definitely the kind you can climb!

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.280
And on top of that roof...

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.660
is a treasure chest!

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.700
Guts!

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.660
Hey, you're slow!

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.090
You're a lap behind!

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.710
Show some more guts!

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.060
I can't with him.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.540
Yaku!

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.210
Nice receive!

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.130
A perfect A-pass!

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.190
Nekoma's totally awesome!

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.970
I just want to sit down.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.390
An A-pass...

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.720
Better than an F-pass.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.030
Kozume,

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:42.030
just because you're close to Kuroo doesn't mean I'm gonna take it easy on you.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.590
What's that even mean?

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.160
What difference does it make that I know Kuro?

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.660
And this is just a regular passing drill.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.190
He never looks enthusiastic, and his voice is soft,

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.570
yet he's actually decent, so it pisses me off.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.230
Take this!

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.410
Dammit!

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.470
Wow, look at those two go.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.750
You need to at least try to work with others.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.630
He started it.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.140
Yeah...

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.420
I enjoy the fact that you're spunky enough to not back down from a fight, but still...

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.070
Look, I know you're not gonna suddenly turn into an extrovert,

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.890
but you're going to be spending a lot of time with these classmates.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:54.900
So...

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.740
I know we're starting with a brand-new team today and things are still a bit awkward,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.760
but let's do our best again tomorrow!

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.320
Thank you!

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.550
Hey, Yamamoto.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.140
You running again?

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.960
Yep! Good work today!

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.770
Yamamoto, no working too hard.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.140
Right...

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.400
Guts!

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.910
Nekoma             Maruguchi Business

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.910
Thank you very much!

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.120
Thank you!

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.260
Gather up all your things!

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.670
Right!

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.130
Hey, Kozume.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.710
Your sets were great today.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.580
Yeah.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.670
They were consistent and super easy to hit, even though this was your first practice match.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.200
And you've got some balls doing a dump even though we were behind.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.510
Keep up the great work!

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.390
This was my super important practice match debut, yet I just kept hitting out of bounds and into the net.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.440
And to top it all off...

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.680
I ran right into Kuroo.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.700
We're going home!

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.360
Yamamoto, it was just a practice match.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.170
Don't worry about it.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.310
Right...

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.180
Good work!

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.160
Thanks!

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.520
Kuroo, Coach's calling for you.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.590
Right.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.780
You need to at least try to work with others.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.950
Uh, hey...

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.840
Yamamoto.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.380
Maybe you could relax your shoulders a bit.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.060
What? Like you?

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.340
Like it's that easy to do.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.450
I'm trying to show off how hard I've been working,

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.880
so how am I supposed to relax?

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.100
Anyway, this just means that I lacked guts.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.520
Quit blaming something as random as guts.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.990
You should probably reflect on what the actual problem is.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.120
I kept concentrating on the ball too much.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.760
I let my opponent provoke me.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.440
I kept going for all the difficult hits.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.340
I-If you realize that, why do you keep blaming it on guts?

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.930
All that extra running and weight training has nothing to do with guts.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.870
It only serves to inflate your ego.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.770
Then what about you, huh?!

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.230
There were plenty of balls you could've gone after!

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.720
Yeah, but I was tired.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.200
And even if I kept the rally going, the other team would've had an easy opportunity to score.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.130
Well, you never show any guts at practice, so how the hell are you gonna during a match?!

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.680
Should we stop them?

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.650
They're not even learning anything at this point. It's just turning into a fight.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.090
You never go after the ball!

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.670
Let them fight. Sometimes you need that.
Your voice is too soft, and you never seem like you try!

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.440
I don't wanna hear about guts from a gutless brat like you!

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.080
All you ever talk about is guts!

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.220
That's ambiguous as hell!

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.280
It's not like it'll help you stay alive with one hit point!

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.230
What the hell are you even talking about?!

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.230
I'm telling you that it won't help you beat a game!

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.240
What the hell do games have to do with this?!

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.190
You need strategy and to think about what you need to win!

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.190
Hey, that's enough, you two.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.780
Mr. Freeze... says to chill out.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.080
Huh?

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.560
What?!

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.960
Wait... What?!

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.420
Where do I even start?!

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.820
Who's Mr. Freeze?

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.030
Never mind that! Who's gonna clean this up?!

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.000
My bad.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.810
Holy crap, Fukunaga!

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.580
Guess we need to get the mop.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.010
Why are you laughing?!

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.030
You're pretty funny, Fukunaga.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.480
What the hell's going on?

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.690
I haven't shouted like this in forever.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.490
Huh?

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.610
What's with this guy?

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.190
This isn't...

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.150
motivation or guts.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.270
He just...

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.150
seriously hates losing!

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.590
Kenma!

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.770
Left.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.500
Kyanma! Move yer ass!

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.320
You could've gotten that one over!

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.760
He figured me out.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.020
But taking even another step is such a hassle.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.810
I wish I had a two-meter wingspan.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.480
But he's still gutless.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.440
Boys' High School Volleyball Tournament
Preliminaries Preliminaries

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.560
Nice spike, Yamamoto!
Yes!

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.790
That was so loud.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.590
Our blocking is starting to get to their number one.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.750
He'll probably try to do a fake attack soon.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.740
They'll probably go for the edges more, so watch your judgment.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.810
Right!

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.690
Nekoma                           Kounan Business

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.570
I'm glad...

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.350
he's not on the other team.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.220
Hey, Kenma.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.710
You can call me "Tora."

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.550
That's what my friends call me.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.940
Do I have to call you that?

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.530
The hell did you just say?!

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.560
Tora!

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.570
Coach Nekomata always put defense first.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.320
And his setters have always been intelligent and intuitive.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.870
Connect
That's all because he's so confident in their defense.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.370
Even if we can't bring down their defense head-on, we can chip away at it, little by little.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.250
If we can chip away at their solid defense...

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.670
their weak setter will expose himself.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.140
Sarukawa Tech Nekoma

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:09.930
Crush him...

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:11.890
Crush him...

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.800
That setter's been babied by having all the passes go right to him.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.420
Now, crush him!

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.030


00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:28.830
The only thing I'm sure of is that the day will come when I finally get it

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:35.580
It doesn't matter if I make some mistakes along the way as long as I hold onto these feelings

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:52.270
In my dreams I wanted to throw off the yoke of gravity and reality

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:58.770
But the day in day out of bringing it all together had me grounded

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:04.780
The boy who acted all tough like he wasn't scared of anything

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:10.790
Still hasn't been torn away from the sweat of fierce competition

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.490
But he's not just hoping for miracles anymore

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:22.340
We can go anywhere we want to because one day our dream will come true

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:28.350
It was no mere coincidence that we made it this far

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:34.100
Every time we're forced from the stage I always wanna get right back on it

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:40.270
And I can hold onto that strong desire because you were there

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.040
