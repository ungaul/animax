WEBVTT

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.730
I touched it!

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.030
I hit it!

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.780
That brat with the glasses just won't give up.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.160
Would you let me handle the timing...

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.540
for the three-person block?

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.670
They finally executed it perfectly.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.050
Total defense.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.050


00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.050


00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.470
All right!

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.680
Nice receive, Nishinoya!

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.480
It was only possible because you guys forced him to the side.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.650
Great job on the block timing!

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.190
Oh, right.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.610
I see!

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.540
That block wasn't done to stop Ushiwaka but to guide the ball.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.410
Nice cooperation!

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.960
That was sort of like mobbing.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.880
Mobbing?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.390
Um, mobbing is where smaller birds will attack larger, predatory birds in groups to try to chase them away.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.060
You know some pretty cool words, Yacchan.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.020
Using a block intended to keep the rally going as a starting point, they brought together every aspect of volleyball.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.110
They were finally able to give it shape.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.230
Yeah.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.410
Total defense is so cool!

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.160
Even if we can't block him,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.580
we'll be able to fight Ushiwaka with this.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.290
They were finally able to dig out one of Ushiwaka's spikes!

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.420
Things are getting interesting!

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.550
Damn it, they've squandered two sets!

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.720
Does that old guy secretly like Karasuno?

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.550
I don't know what's with him.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.850
Give us a good one, Asahi!

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.940
It's going out!

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.570
Yeah!

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.320
Seriously?

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.860
All right, two points in a row!

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.910
Finish this set off in one go!

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.790
They definitely got us with that serve, but we're going to turn things around!

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.750
Right!

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.000
Give us another good serve, Asahi!

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.040
Tsutomu!
Right!

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.500
Nice receive!

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.420
Oohira.
Got it!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.760
It wasn't Ushiwaka this time?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.470
I'm sure they're worried about his stamina.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.930
Ready, and... go!

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.560
Tch.
A tip!

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.980
Sorry! It's going—

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.820
Victory is mine!
Yeah!

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.320
Not yet. We still need two more points.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.780
Just how uptight are you?

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.160
Ushiwaka is in the back row now.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.080
But...

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.790
that means he gets to serve.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.710
It's mine!

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.300
Get the last hit over!
Ryuu!

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.300
Got it!

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.930
This is a chance to score!

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.310
Gimme!

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.270
Where is he—

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.690
A dump?!

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.650
Damn it!

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
Nice dump, Shirabu!

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.460
Shirabu! Shirabu!

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.500
Depending on Ushijima...

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.000
isn't the only thing I do.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.710
All right!

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.010
Not bad.
Nice job, Shirabu!

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.720
Sorry.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.930
I shouldn't have touched the ball.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.680
Nah, I wouldn't have been able to get that either way.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.770
This is no time to relax!

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.940
Right!

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.190
They got to set point first!

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.950
Is something wrong?

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.820
It seemed like Kei was acting a little weird to me.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.780
I might just be imagining it.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.290
His eyes seem much more lively than usual.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.380
Does Kei actually have friends at school besides Tadashi?

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.340
Is it going out?
No...

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.090
Cover it!
Left!

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.550
Tanaka!

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.470
Three blockers!

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.810
A wipe!

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.810
Nice!

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.820
Nice, Ryuu!

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.820
Now it's a deuce.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.360
All right!

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.740
We're counting on you, Hinata!

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.780
Make sure you get some payback!

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.750
Hey.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.250
Now Suga can't be subbed in again, right?

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.380
Yeah.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.430
There's a rule where the same player can't be switched in twice within the same set.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.470
But we survived Ushiwaka's serve.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.180
Now we amp up our offense with Hinata in the front row.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.390
Karasuno definitely has the upper hand!

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.650
Give us a good serve, Tsukishima!

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.820
I hit it!

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.070
Hey.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.620
If they can dig out my serve cleanly, there's a good chance of them doing a fast attack.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.540
Try jumping as high as you can against number five.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.540
Let's score here!

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.510
Bring it!

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.510
Give it to me!

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.180
All right!

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.810
A payback setter dump...

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.100
Man, competitive people are scary.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.650
They're bad for my heart.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.520
Nice, Kageyama!

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.240
Yeah, great job, King.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.700
Tsukishima!

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.120
Yes! They took back the lead!

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.540
Now it's our set point!

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.290
Karasuno, keep fighting!

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.670
I'm sure this is extremely obvious,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.430
but it truly is hard to score two points in a row.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.510
Well, volleyball was designed so that each side has equal opportunities to attack.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:18.810
Not to mention, when we get into the last part of the set, each side gets that much more eager to win.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.150
But each side has to start whittling down their opponent's defense.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.450
Even with pure height and power, their ability to keep the ball in play,

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.580
and, to some extent, the calmness and stamina to maintain teamwork...

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.000
In order to win, they need the tremendous amount of energy required to score two points in a row.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.380
Even with the set on the line, they're still hitting their serves hard.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.630
They really are good.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.970
Sorry, it went long!

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.600
Kageyama, push it over!

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.560
Got it!

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.480
Nice, Tsutomu!

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.150
We can score here!

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.200
He's... ...trying to fake us out?

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.290
He's sending it over there?

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.170
There's... one and a half blockers!

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.210
All right!

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.180
Damn. He sure is a first-rate decoy.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.300
All right!

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.180
Nice spike, Tanaka!

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.810
Did he set to number five because he knew we'd be watching number ten?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.100
Nice set, Kageyama!

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.230
Actually, it was a little early. I'm sorry.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.150
You sure are hard on yourself.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.110
It really does piss people off when Hinata is scuttling around in front of them.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.030
Go as wild as you can,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.660
you deviant duo.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.700
You fools!

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.040
Shiratorizawa's taking their first timeout!

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:14.050


00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.980
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.270
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.690
Shiratorizawa!
It's true we've never faced any team like them before.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.700
Still, there's no reason to panic at every little thing they try.
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.490
We just have to score points like we usually do.
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.200
Shiratorizawa!
Anyway, let's focus on scoring twice!

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.200
Yes, sir!

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.170
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:50.300
Man, after the first set, I thought it'd be an easy win for Shiratorizawa.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.010
Is Karasuno what you call a dark horse?

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.300
They used to be a powerhouse school too.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.680
Yeah, you're right.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.310
They've got Nishinoya from Chidoriyama, Kageyama from Kita First, and Azumane from Seikoudai.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.020
It's quite the lineup.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.650
Even if it gets rough or you start to panic, don't start slacking now!

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.360
All right!

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.780
They can't seem to get those last two points.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.660
I'm pretty sure both teams are thinking that.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.040
However, if Karasuno loses this set, they're toast.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.160
You have to pull through!

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.080
We're counting on you, Eita.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.880
Right!

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.590
Semi! Go hit a good serve!

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.050
Shiratorizawa is using a pinch server?

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.890
Give us a good serve, Eita!

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.850
Sorry!

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.560
Daichi!

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.780
Above you, Shirabu!

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.480
Right!

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.950
Semi!

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.320
Come get it, Tsutomu!

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.490
Right!

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.460
All right!

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.920
That's two in a row!
Yeah!

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.580
Goshiki!

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.340
Goshiki!

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.630
Oh yeah, he's a setter.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.510
Concentrate on this point!

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.800
Right!

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.430
Give us a good one!

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:24.850
Daichi!

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.810
Damn it! It's short!

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.230
Yes! The receive is off!

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.190
Huh?!

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.360
All right!

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.070
They did a fast attack from there?! They're seriously messed up!

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.490
Nice spike, Hinata!

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.790
Looks like conventional logic doesn't apply to Karasuno either.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.710
Who does Karasuno's setter think he is?

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.920
Give us a good serve, Tanaka!

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:58.840
Got it!

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.390
Come on... Score again!

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.880
Left!

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.270
Yes!

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.190
Wakatoshi!

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.810
Three blockers!

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.320
Wow, it looks like that libero's really getting the hang of it.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.660
But Ushiwaka's still only using about 70% of his strength.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.240
Would you be able to receive those?

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.370
Not a chance.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.410
Damn it!

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.210
Sorry! It was close to the net!

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.630
We can't give up yet! We're just getting started!

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.300
Give us a good one, Shirabu!

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.260
Got it!

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.720
Nice receive!

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.720
Right!

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.350
All right!
Shit!

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.230
Nice, Daichi!
Yes!

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.690
Of course not.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.200
Our bodies are different.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.910
Our experience levels are different.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.490
The amount of time we've spent on volleyball is different.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.160
There's no way I can beat Ushiwaka.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.750
But...

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.890
I was hoping they could score twice in a row while they still had Hinata as a decoy.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.850
He looks so anxious in the back row.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.480
He sucks at both serving and digs.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.110
Give us a good serve, Hinata!

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.900
Right!

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.910
If their number five's guess blocking is worth either 120 points or 0 points,

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.120
I'd say read blocking stays around an average of 75 points.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.960
Well, our blocks definitely need more work,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:07.050
but maybe it looks cooler to bystanders when people go for the block worth 120 points.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.470
Give us a good serve!

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:16.480
We can't let the opposing setter feel the pleasure or sense of accomplishment from overcoming our blocks.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.310
Got it!

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:22.030
We have to be persistent, tenacious, and nimble at the same time.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:19.650
Nice receive!

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.820
We absolutely...

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.870
can't just let them get through.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:34.500
We have to continue pressuring them and piling on stress.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.210
I touched it!

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.050
Keep it going!

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.220
Hit it over!

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.060
Nice, Tachi!
Got it!

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:59.480
You suck at serving, you suck at receiving, and your setting and blocking are below average.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.440
So what do you do on the court?

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.110
You score points!

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.780
All right!

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.990
Two in a row!

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.660
A back row attack with minus tempo!
Great job, Hinata!

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.710
He's gotten even faster since that time Oikawa stopped him!

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.840
Taichi! Don't just stand there!

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.920
Nah, getting that one was impossible.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.380
Nice job making contact!
Give us another good serve, Hinata!

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.640
If it weren't for Hinata saving it, it would've been just like he blew right through my block.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.350
But if you didn't get a hand on it, we might've been done right then and there.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.270
Shirabu.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.860
I want them all.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.570
Crap!

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.570
Is it going out?

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.950
If I guess wrong, they'll kill me!

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.000
It stayed in!
His receive is off.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.040
I'm sorry!

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.960
Wakatoshi!

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.960
We've got three blockers.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.210
Ready, and... go!

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.090
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.100
Ushijima!

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.350
Ushijima!

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.270
That was ferocious.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.110
It was like he changed the momentum of the match with a single swing of his arm.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.360
Don't fall behind! Keep being aggressive!

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.150
Right!

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.370
What an intense serve.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:44.420
Yes!

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.250
A synchronized attack!

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.430
If we have the power to score points, we won't lose!

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.560
Yeah!

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.190
Give us a good serve, Daichi!

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.860
Ushijima!

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.320
Ready, and... go!

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.950
Give up already!

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.040
Get it back over!

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.660
Nice, Daichi!

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:23.580
Here's our chance!

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.220
I have to open the way... for our spiker!

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.810
I was waiting for this fraying caused by slight annoyance and panic...

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.400
to appear.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.520
Of course not.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.180
But...

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.980
I plan on stopping at least a few of his spikes.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.610
He stopped Ushiwaka?!

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.780
Who is that guy?!

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.650
No idea!

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.900
Amazing!

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.450
They took back the second set!

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:44.120
It's merely one block.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.330
It's merely one point out of 25.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.790
This is merely a club.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.010
But if you ever experience that moment,

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.850
that's when you'll be hooked on volleyball.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.220
All right!

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.900
Tsukishima!

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.610
Ow!

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:21.370
There wasn't any weakness in his approach or his jump for that spike.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.750
But the set was probably a bit close to the net and low.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.750
Tsukishima didn't let that escape him.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.420
Or... was he waiting for that?

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.800
Sorry for saying something about how we could still fight even if we couldn't stop him with our blocks.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.840
Huh?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.470
You made a weird face when I said that.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.270
Huh?!

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.770
No, I just thought that Tsukki was working so hard.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:56.690
Despite how he looks, he hates losing, so I figured he'd probably do something.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.400
Nice block, Tsukishima!

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.200
Great job stopping that!

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.200
I'm sure other blockers as good as I am have gone up against Ushiwaka before,

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.620
but I think that Nishinoya's receives and the deviant duo's attack that completely ignores their blocks

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.840
helped put pressure on their setter.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.920
You thought about all that?

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.720
That's scary.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.180
You're scary, Tsukishima.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:27.930
I think that Kei might've been waiting this whole time for the timing of Shiratorizawa's sets to be off slightly.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.900
I can't believe he thought that far ahead.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.900
Tsukishima is smart,

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.900
so I believe he's always thinking, whether it be about volleyball or something else.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.700
I'm sure he's pretty stubborn.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.570
Sorry about that.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.820
Oh, no...

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:52.830
It's just that at that moment, I think the only thing on his mind was stopping that spike.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.540
He was focused solely on that,

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.800
like he was solving a difficult question on a test.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:01.930
Yeah.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.300
Tsukishima!

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.890
That one point was worth 100 points!

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.560
Thanks.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:24.200
What?!

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.320
Calm down, Hinata!

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.950
I know his face says, "If you're a middle blocker, you should give try it too," but calm down!

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.740
Please stop causing a scene.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.920
That was merely one point.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.460
The match is just getting started.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.960
Yeah!

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:42.090


00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:12.060


00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.890
Tsukki finally stopped Ushiwaka!

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.770
Kei usually doesn't show his emotions and is blunt,

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.230
but he actually works really hard, is kind, and is a good kid...

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.110
Who are you, his mother?!

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.110
Next time on Haikyuu!!:

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.150
"One vs. Many."

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.300
Got a wish that can't be forced through

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.180
Barely hanging on and staying true

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.140
With a little help from timing and your crew

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.890
You can still stay standing

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.890
Wanna take the fight head-on

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.650
Might get lost, but keep on keeping on

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:01.230
'Cause that's where your chance lies

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.610
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.290
The rest is up to you

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.660
Make your dreams and ideals come true

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.460
Or sit tight and let the future pass on through

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.590
The rest is up to you

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.800
You ain't the luckiest of guys

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.220
And you ain't anywhere near wise

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.140
The winds of change are too bright for your eyes

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.470
But you wanna have all the luck

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.060
Stuff all the wisdom junk in your trunk

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.940
And live holding your head up high

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.280
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:51.280
It's all up to you People might call you naive

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.080
And say you're not doing it right

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.960
But the rest is up to you

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.210
Don't lose your way, and push on anew

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.840
It's all up to you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.380
Light a fire in every cell of your body

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.720
By taking a deep, long breath

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.480
Turn your blood and tears into offerings

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.190
Carry a torch fueled by your desires

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:50.410
And scream out at full volume Let there be light

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.450
With a prayer for the future, start your sprint

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.710
Let there be light, use the dark as your runway

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.340
And sprint through the path you chose

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.720
Let there be light, believe in the glory within your grasp

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.810
And run headlong into the despair in front of you

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.980
Let there be light
There is only one reason I kick the ground

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.150
Let there be light

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.230
It is so I shine brighter and soar higher than before

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.240
Let there be light, so that your brilliance of today

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.040
Shows your friends who are lost The way to the future

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.750
To those who bear the cross of their dreams

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.050
The warriors who seek eternal glory Let there be light
