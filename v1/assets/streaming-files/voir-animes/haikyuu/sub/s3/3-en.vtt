WEBVTT

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.320
Now bring it!

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.400
He got it up!

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.700
You'll be begging for mercy when I'm done with you, Ushiwaka!

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.000
If you wanna beat Wakatoshi, you're gonna have to go through me.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.000


00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.010


00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.680
Whoa...

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.940
The Guessing Monster makes his appearance.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.440
What do they mean by that?

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.940
Does he scare people by guessing their name correctly or something?

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.780
I-Is he going to poke them in the eyes or something?

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.450
Be careful, Hinata!

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.240
That'd be cheating.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.910
Give us a good one, Reon!

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.290
Sorry!

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.540
Finish it off, Kageyama!

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.420
Stop them again!

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.130
Blocking isn't about stopping the ball.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800
Tsutomu, cover the straight spike.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.560
It's a technique to smack down the ball.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.150
All right!

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.280
When you're able to get a clean block off,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.910
that's a powerful psychological technique all on its own.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.790
I'm starting to get into it!

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.960
Get the next one!

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.830
Shake it off, Kageyama!

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.340
Shake, shake it off! Kageyama!

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.260
Nice receive!

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.430
So naive.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.860
All right!

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.870
My guess blocking is worth 120 points today!

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.000
How is he able to react like that?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
It's not just his reaction time.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.920
In that moment, there were three possibilities.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.430
First, Kageyama's in the front row currently, so it was possible for him to do a setter dump.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.220
So he had to consider that.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.640
If he wasn't going to do a dump,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.020
he could've set to Tanaka or Hinata in the front row and Azumane or Sawamura in the back row.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.900
And in this case, he picked Hinata,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.900
but there were also a few places Hinata could've spiked it.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.160
You can see quite a bit from up here,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.200
but when you're on the court, you can get lost in the chaos easily.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.290
So even if you know which way you want to go, your body may not move right.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.920
But his body can do it.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.220
I guess it's no surprise that they took a timeout.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.050
I totally thought that they were going to do a back row attack just now.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.310
I mean, he gave that other guy a look.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.430
That was a total fake out.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.310
Huh?

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.940
Karasuno's setter is pretty good, right?

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.440
Yet that glance was way too obvious and over the top.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.990
Glances, footwork, and ball handling...

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.450
If Tendou figures any of those things out, you're finished.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.070
Nice block, Satori.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.990
Thanks.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.080
Sorry I'm the one standing out today, Wakatoshi.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.330
That's not a problem.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.540
We're going to stop them here!

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.880
Hinata, we're going to switch things up! Get this next one!

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.750
Right!

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.590
Hey, Kageyama, what's wrong with your face?

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.380
Nothing's wrong.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.680
You liar!

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.840
It's one thing when my spike gets blocked,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.560
but it pisses me off a million times more when a spike from my set gets blocked.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.900
How is their number five able to keep blocking like that?

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.690
You remember read blocking, right?

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.240
You see where the set is going before jumping up to block, right?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.280
Yeah.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.160
"Read" in this case doesn't necessarily mean to see it coming, but more to understand your opponent.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.660
Since you're jumping up after watching the ball, there's no danger in the set tricking you.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.880
You'll react a little slowly, but if you can make up for that by getting three blockers in place, it's the most effective.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.630
We're still trying to learn this technique.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.090
On the other hand, what's special about number five...

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.970
is his reading and intuition.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.180
He does guess blocking.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.640
By "guess," I mean it's more like a prediction.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.810
He predicts what attack we'll do before the set goes up, and then he'll jump pretty much on intuition.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.940
Guess?!

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.820
Of course, there'll be times where his intuition is off,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.530
and he might get in the way of his team's blocks and receives.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.120
This is definitely a style of blocking that doesn't work for everyone.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.370
That said, I think he's so accurate with his guesses that it's scary.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.580
On top of that, his body can react to those guesses.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.000
It'd be best to assume there's no pattern to the way he moves.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.920
Don't overthink it and get distracted.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.840
Yes, sir!

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.970
What do we need to do in order for him not to read our sets?

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.100
Does that mean Kageyama's going to have to do those crazy decoy moves that Hinata does too?

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.060
I wouldn't mind seeing that.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.860
Give us another good serve!

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.030
Up front!

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.070
Sorry! It's short!

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.570
It doesn't matter how you try to fake Tendou out.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.830
So this must be what it means to have perfect coordination.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.960
I just barely missed it.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.720
Yeah!

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.220
Go, go, Karasuno! Push it, push it, Karasuno!

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.560
I had no idea where the set was going to go until after he landed the spike.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.320
You aimed that to go right over my head after what I just did, didn't you?

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.400
You must really be a sore loser.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.950
I knew you guys would be interesting!

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.080
Here's a chance to score!

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.460
I've made a mistake!

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.880
Let's try again!
Okay!

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.590
Got it!

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.720
It'd be best to assume there's no pattern to the way he moves.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.350
Don't overthink it and get distracted.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.480
And with opponents like this,

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.600
it's best to lead them as far left or right as possible.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.860
You just don't stop moving, do you?

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.990
All right!

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.410
Yes! We caught up!

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.200
Nice spike, Hinata!

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.160
Way to go, Hinata!

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:42.540
There have been setters who I admired for trying so hard to stop me from reading their moves,

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.010
but that number ten's timing is something else.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.220
If I'm even one tempo late, I can't get it.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.220
Were you just expecting us to forget your "I've made a mistake!" from earlier?

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.600
Ayup, I guess... You're talking strangely, Tendou.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.690
Give us another good serve, Kageyama!

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.070
Nice receive!

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.490
Nice receive!

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.990
This is their chance to attack!

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.370
I hit it!

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.960
Got it!

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.890
Did he try to fake me out?

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.600
Or did he just change his mind?

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.810
It really seems like conventional logic

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.310
doesn't work on Shiratorizawa.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.320
Just what is with number five's blocking?

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.110
He's planning on stopping all of them on his own.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.490
Huh?

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.450
Tendou's blocks are basically blocks used to score points.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.210
He uses his opponent's spikes against them to score himself.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.040
But there's more to blocking than just that.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:14.130
The way we block to keep the ball in play can score points too if we get it to work.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:21.060
In any case, depending on the timing, blocks can actually be more valuable than spikes.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.350
I see.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.190
Nice receive!

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.690
Don't let them pull away!
Ushijima!

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.070
If you give them an opening, they're not going to stop!

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.620
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.750
That was like a spike to shut up the commoners.
Ushijima! Ushijima!

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.340
Ushiwaka's on another level, man.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.170
In order to stop attacks, blocks evolve.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.300
And in order to break through blocks, attacks also evolve.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:03.770
Attacks become diverse by using the back row, getting faster, and players working in combination.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:09.480
And then by changing how one jumps and where one jumps from, blocks shut down attacks.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.910
They think they're at the top, but they continue to develop and reach even higher heights.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.160
Looks like you've learned a few things, sir.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.740
Those are just words.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:26.080
I'm sure they kept developing their understanding through an unbreakable fighting spirit and unwavering tenacity.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.080
All right!

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.710
While miraculous plays save the team,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.130
the same can be said about improving their understanding.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.630
Oh?

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.840
Hey, it's the normal guy.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.800
Okay. Don't let him get to you.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.890
Give us a good serve!

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.600
It's dropping!

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.230
Here's our chance!

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.690
Damn it! I'm sorry!

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.610
That delayed timing attack again?

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.490
Huh?

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.160
Tsukki!
Yes!

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.870
Hi. I'm the normal guy.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:13.750
A one-man delayed timing attack may've fooled our feral children, but it doesn't work on me.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.300
Take your best shot.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.680
I knew that all you Karasuno first-years pissed me off, but you take the cake!

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.430
Thank you.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.600
Screw you, man!

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.230
Give us a good serve, Asahi!

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.950
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.700
Please don't stop thinking.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.250
Ushijima! Ushijima!

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.620
Be Karasuno's understanding.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:58.970


00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:16.730
I'll definitely...

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.570
I'll definitely get my chance.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:28.580
Please put me in. Please put me in. Please put me in.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.870
Yamaguchi's really trying to will me to do something.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:28.580
Huh?

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.000
I touched it!

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.880
Got it!

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.890
I hit it!

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.720
So annoying.
We can score here!

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.730
Yeah!

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.200
That was all yours, Tsutomu! Ya idjit!

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.160
If yer gonna stare at something, stare at a girl!

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:08.950
Y-Yes, sir!

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.620
Pfft... "Yes, sir."

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.920
I don't care if yer runnin' inta each other! Go for the damn ball, ya idjits!
And there's the demon coach.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.840
I thought he was gonna stay quiet today.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.880
Yeah!

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.390
Give us a good serve, Suga!

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.350
Reon, up front!

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.480
Switch places!

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.230
And then...

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.610
a synchronized attack!

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.320
Yeah!

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.320
Nice, Kageyama!

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.580
What?! What happened just now?!

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.540
Did the setter just spike?!

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.870
Those crafty bastards...

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.420
I guess things haven't changed, even with the grandson in charge.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.510
Oh, right. Karasuno's coach is Coach Ukai's grandson.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.050
Ukai...

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.760
He always did think that doing new things was the key to success.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.930
I never did like him.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.810
Always relying on the left-handed cannon is archaic.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.980
Your team is ridiculous and has everyone attack, so no one's there to give backup!

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:27.030
There're only a certain number of things you can do with these high school teams that change every year.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.450
Polishing the diamonds in the rough as best you can...

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.790
All right!

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.910
...is the best possible option.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.290
Coach Washijou never changes.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.750
Oohira! Oohira "Simple is best."

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:49.390
He loves tall and powerful players, and he's always on the lookout for talent.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.850
Give us a good one, Reon.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.310
Even if they didn't fit in on their old team,

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:57.230
if they fit Coach Washijou's definition of "skilled," there won't be a problem.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.570
And then he puts them through hardcore training to get them in shape.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.740
But they can't all be star players, right?

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.070
Of course not.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.660
It's a stroke of luck even getting one player with Ushijima's skill.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:19.370
Using a powerful player like him as the main attacker and making sure that no one gets in his way...

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.080
Ushijima!

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.260
probably sums up Shiratorizawa's style.
All right!

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.550
Ushiwaka really doesn't let up!

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:35.390
But there are still ways to turn things around.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.350
Nice receive!

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.650
All right!

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.230
Nice spike, Tsutomu!

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.280
Give us a good serve, Shirabu!

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.660
Got it!

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.910
All right!

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.500
Nice one, Shouyou!

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.710
All this stress isn't good for my heart...

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.040
Me neither...

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.760
As long as I'm around, you're invincible!

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.810
I could never say something that confident,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.110
but I've gotten to the point where I can be helpful.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.280
Give us a good serve.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.830
Their formation broke!

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:38.750
Good!

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.250
My chance will definitely... Sorry!

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.000
Wakatoshi!

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.290
Let's stop him!
Yeah!

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.420
Good.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.380
I just need one high set.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.190
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.110
Ushijima! Ushijima!
This is what it means to be good.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.620
Keep on breaking them!

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.950
What, you say? Their hearts!

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.370
Keep on shattering them!

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.330
What, you say?

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.800
Their blocks?

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.420
Nah, their spirits!

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.260
Keep on breaking them... I can never read this guy.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.230
That brat with the glasses just won't give up.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.770
If you would, sir.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.480
Right!

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.320
Looks like not even that serve will keep them down.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.320
Yeah.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.490
When they're able to stop 'em, they can, and when they can't stop 'em, they can't! Got it?!

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.370
It's true that completely shutting them down or breaking through a three-person block looks cool,

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.960
and it'd excite you guys,

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.960
but don't be so eager to end things.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.380
I'm sure that the rougher things get, the more you'll want to end things in one shot.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:18.760
But don't forget to imagine how the rally could continue, whether it's making some contact or going for a rebound.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.350
It's all about keeping the ball in play.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.850
He doesn't mean you're supposed to put up your guard.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.440
I know that!

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.650
I know you get sick of me saying this, but even plays that don't lead to points directly can be built on.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.320
We're finally playing a best-of-five.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.370
It'd be a waste to spend the whole time dreading how long you've still got.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.580
Right! Let's do this!

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.500
Yeah!

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.580
Um...

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.880
Would you let me handle the timing...

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.970
for the three-person block?

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.510
Shirabu.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.890
Don't forget to pass to Wakatoshi.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.060
Right. Got it.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.190
That little shit!

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.610
Now, now.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.240
Give us a good one, Tsutomu!

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.700
Daichi!
Yeah!

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.620
Damn it! That number one is there every single time!

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.590
All right!

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.300
Give us a good serve, Daichi!

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:37.840
Tsutomu!
Right!

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.340
Nice receive!

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.100
I hit it!

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.690
Ryuu!

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:49.730
He kept the rally going!

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.440
Nice timing! And nice contact!

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.900
Keep it going!

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.110
They can't stop Ushijima.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.110
What's Karasuno's coach so happy about?

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.070
They haven't stopped him yet.
Got it!

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.530
We can score here!

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.090
Nice spike, Oohira!

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.840
Oohira!

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.710
Give us a good serve, Taichi!

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.300
Here I go!

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.890
Nice receive, Shirabu!
He hit it at the setter on the spur of the moment.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:32.770
Wakatoshi!

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.730
Cage him in!

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.070
What's important is the block's width and timing!

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.160
Make him feel our wall!

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.070
Here we go. Slowly.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.830
Ready, and...

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:47.990
go!

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.960
And waiting where it breaks through...

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.010
is our super libero!

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.720
Everything they do is connected!

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.970
The set's nearing its end.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.100
They finally got this important receive up.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.730
It's gotta be... over here!

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.320
Seriously?

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.120
All right!

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.330
Yeah!

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.540
They finally executed it perfectly.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.790
Total defense.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.250
Now...

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:39.800
it really begins!

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:42.010


00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:11.970


00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.430
Keep on breaking them!

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.440
What, you say? Their hearts!

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.110
Keep on shattering them! What, you say?

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.190
Their spirits, right?

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.900
Nah, their will!

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.360
They both mean the same thing!

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.320
Next time on Haikyuu!!:
"The Halo Around the Moon."

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.220
Got a wish that can't be forced through

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.100
Barely hanging on and staying true

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.060
With a little help from timing and your crew

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.810
You can still stay standing

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.810
Wanna take the fight head-on

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.560
Might get lost, but keep on keeping on

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.150
'Cause that's where your chance lies

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.530
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.160
The rest is up to you

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.580
Make your dreams and ideals come true

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.330
Or sit tight and let the future pass on through

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.500
The rest is up to you

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.710
You ain't the luckiest of guys

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.130
And you ain't anywhere near wise

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:29.050
The winds of change are too bright for your eyes

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.390
But you wanna have all the luck

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.930
Stuff all the wisdom junk in your trunk

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:39.860
And live holding your head up high

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.190
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:51.200
It's all up to you People might call you naive

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.000
And say you're not doing it right

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.870
But the rest is up to you

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.130
Don't lose your way, and push on anew

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.760
It's all up to you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.340
Light a fire in every cell of your body

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.680
By taking a deep, long breath

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.430
Turn your blood and tears into offerings

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.140
Carry a torch fueled by your desires

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:47.360
And scream out at full volume Let there be light

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.410
With a prayer for the future, start your sprint

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.660
Let there be light, use the dark as your runway

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.290
And sprint through the path you chose

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.670
Let there be light, believe in the glory within your grasp

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.760
And run headlong into the despair in front of you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.930
Let there be light
There is only one reason I kick the ground

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.110
Let there be light

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.190
It is so I shine brighter and soar higher than before

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.190
Let there be light, so that your brilliance of today

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:39.040
Shows your friends who are lost The way to the future

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.710
To those who bear the cross of their dreams

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.010
The warriors who seek eternal glory Let there be light
