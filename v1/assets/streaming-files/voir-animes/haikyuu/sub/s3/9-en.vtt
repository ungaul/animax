WEBVTT

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.320
I haven't once doubted that we would win.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.200
But right now, I distinctly want to...

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.780
hand you a crushing defeat.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.920
All right!

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.550
One more point! One more point!

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.010


00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.980


00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.900
Go! One more!

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.040
Ugh, it hurts.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.750
This seriously sucks.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.170
Don't come in planning on being a decoy.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.170
Come to a stop and then jump straight up.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.300
Oh, by the way, when you're going against a spiker one-on-one,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.260
you generally don't stand in front of their body.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.430
Center yourself on their dominant arm instead.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.770
Getting too comfortable can be scary.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.310
Even the deviant fast attack that we thought was unstoppable can be stopped.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.740
Yeah!

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.870
Damn it! One more time!

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.040
Did you just change where you were going to block?

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.450
So you noticed?

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.500
Not bad.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.540
Tsukki! Block some balls for me! Okay?!

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.930
He's not just being calm. He's concentrating.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.180
Not on how the match is going,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.810
but probably about what he's going to do when he gets back.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.400
Tsukki!

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.070
The glasses guy from Karasuno's back!

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.120
It's too late. The match is only one point away from over.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.990
It's not over!

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.000
Tsukishi—

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.330
The bleeding has stopped.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.710
They immobilized the part that was dislocated.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.840
Because it was my pinky, it shouldn't have much effect.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.880
That basically sums it up.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.890
I guess the day's finally come where even he would beg me to put him in.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.890
Is Kei okay?!

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.560
Um, he hurt his pinky, so they taped it to his ring finger and immobilized it, and apparently he can keep playing.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.900
But I'm pretty sure...

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.150
the pain hasn't stopped.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.780
I bought you some time.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.790
Though, to be honest, Yamaguchi actually bought more time than me.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.540
Well, thanks for your honesty.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:46.680
One more point! One more point!

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.840
It's probably going to be a jump float serve.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.470
We need to move up slightly.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.680
If we can stop them here, it'll be Asahi's turn to serve next.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.390
Give us a good serve, Yunohama!

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.650
Daichi!

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.980
All right!

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.320
If they didn't have that guy, Karasuno's defense would be even more full of holes than it is.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.070
Nice receive!

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.080
All right!
He predicted what I was going to do.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.080
Looks like that's not going to work anymore.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.340
What a time to do a setter dump!

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.130
Good!

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.300
Though the stress is killing me, damn it!

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.260
We're counting on you, Tsukishima.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.940
Well done.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.070
The fact that you were able to play normally under this amount of pressure is impressive.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.030
Right!

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.780
Tsukishima!

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.950
Look at you, making a hero's grand entrance!

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.160
Um, about the three-person block...

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.460
Not phased one bit, are you?

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.670
Tsukishima!

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.670
We're counting on you!
All right.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.880
Now both Tobio and Kei are back.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.090
Time for the counterattack!

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.340
We're gonna get through this!

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.840
Yeah!

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.730
I doubt you would, but you don't need to hold back.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.900
If you don't think I'm going to, then don't say it.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.900
And I won't.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.400
Shirabu.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.280
You remember our promise, don't you?

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.740
Will you be able to use me mercilessly no matter what?

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.040
Yes!

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.340
I really hate having to serve at the end of the match while being behind.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.300
Please land this serve!

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.130
Don't hold back!

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.260
Be aggressive!

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.590
Give it everything you've got, Asahi!

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.100
I'm surprised by how reassuring it is that they all have their backs to me.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.260
All right! Bring it!

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.480
Yes! Yes!

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.150
Give it to me!

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.740
Again?!

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.950
Go, Wakatoshi!

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.630
His right hand!

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.340
This is so stupid.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.430
I'm not Hinata.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.600
Why do I want to fight to the very end?

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.890
I hit it!

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.560
Whoa, he managed to stop it again.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.400
What happened to Four-eyes?

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.320
At our first practice match, I thought he was just a tall guy that was slightly intelligent.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.330
Nice, Nishinoya!

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.700
We can score here!

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.910
Ushijima!

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.920
A delayed timing attack from the right.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.080
We're going to open it up!

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.590
It's in Nishinoya's field of vision.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.670
Nice receive!

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:11.260
I'm surprised he's able to make these quick decisions while still being able to instruct others.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:13.720
Asahi!

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.600
Tsutomu!

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.770
Nice!

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.850
Finish it off!

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.600
Again...

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.520
He's going to spike it.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.740
Three spikes in a row from Ushiwaka!

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.870
It bounced off the net!

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.580
Yes!
This is our chance!

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.330
My legs are so friggin' heavy!

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.830
Don't give up on me, legs!

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.340
I'm going to spike it!

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.260
Tsukishima's doing a broad jump?!

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.180
He's faking!

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.180
He's figured me out.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.390
But I managed to gain them a few fractions of a second.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:09.320
Th-That's two points in a row!

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.030
All right!

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.820
We did it!

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.620
They're at a match point!

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.950
One more point, and they'll beat Shiratorizawa!

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.620
I think they might just be able to do it!

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.420
We've been pressuring them ever since Kei came back!

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.750
Go, Karasuno!

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.090
I guess it's no surprise that Shiratorizawa took a timeout.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.510
Karasuno really is versatile.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.180
I've never seen Four-eyes do a broad jump, even if he was just a decoy.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.940
We can't easily abandon a near-perfect delayed timing attack,

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.900
and Shiratorizawa's not going to change their style of perfecting individual strengths.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.900
That's why we're called powerhouse schools now.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.740
Who would've ever thought you'd set us up like that!

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:56.120
But Karasuno probably doesn't have a style they need to stay true to.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.120
I'm so happy, Tsukishima!

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.870
They may've had one when they were a powerhouse school.
Hey, take every chance you get to sit down and rest, no matter how small!

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.580
So they don't hesitate to try new things.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.380
They even gave up that miracle-like superhuman fast attack immediately and turned it into something new.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.130
The old and dependable Shiratorizawa...

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.010
The new and reckless Karasuno...

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.970
Either one of them winning is going to piss me off, so they should both lose.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.520
You really are a piece of shit.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.100
Could you stop calling me a "piece of shit"?!

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.190
It's either that or "shithead."

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.230
Well, then I guess I choose "piece of shit"!

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.650
Don't let up 'til the end!
I'm sure all of their legs are at their limits by now.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.080
It's obvious why for Ushiwaka, since he's spiked it so many times,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.870
but for Karasuno's offense, they've done more running approaches than spikes.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.670
That may look like a lot of needless movement,

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:55.550
but that's the primary factor in how Karasuno's offense is prying through Shiratorizawa's blocks.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.430
Since Tanaka, Azumane, and Sawamura have been playing this whole time,

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.850
I'm sure they're past their limits by now.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.060
Nishinoya, are you okay?

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.730
Yeah. I've been able to rest here and there, so I'm okay.
Ushijima's scored around 40 points.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.400
He scored almost half of Shiratorizawa's points all by himself.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.910
And that's despite the fact that we always have someone on him, and some of the sets have been hard to hit.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.570
I knew he was good.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.620
I knew that,

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.250
but Ushijima Wakatoshi is beyond impressive.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.210
Ushijima.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.170
When you said to set to you whenever possible,

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.800
you meant while you were still useful, right?

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.630
What?!

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.970
Hey, I don't know what's going on, but how could you say that?!

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.060
That's right.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.520
Let's go.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:54.860
Fire it up, fire it up, Karasuno! Get it, get it, Karasuno!

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.730
If volleyball was a one-on-one sport, we wouldn't stand a chance against Shiratorizawa.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.150
We're smaller, and our attacking ability falls short in comparison.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.740
But there are six of us on the court.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.700
We don't have to work miracles to win.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.960
We'll stick with our concept until the very end!

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.830
We're going to punch our way through!

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.420
Yeah!

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.630
This is as far as we can help them.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.590
We've both used up all of our timeouts.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.750
You can do it!

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.050
Focus!

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.470
Let's stay calm and score that point!

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.550
The next time you step off that court... Yeah!

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.850
...return as victors!

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:29.980


00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.450
Give us a good serve, Asahi!

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.370
Here comes that take-no-prisoners serve!

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.040
End it here. End it with this serve!

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.210
Yes!
They did—

00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:59.720
All right!

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.930
Such a waste!

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:04.890
Sorry!
Shake it off!

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.640
The serve toss was fine, but my footwork was a little sloppy.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:14.060
And now, Ushijima is serving.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.750
Sorry.
Shake it off!

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.040
When we get back, they're gonna do a hundred serves.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.090
Neither side is holding back at all!

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.090
That's lucky for us, but it's also a waste.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.470
I mean, it's all for naught if they mess up.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.890
But just hitting a powerful serve puts pressure on the other team.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.770
Huh?

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.100
A jump serve is a very risky way to serve.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.610
But it's not about picking between a guaranteed serve and a risky serve.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:01.150
Instead, a good team is one can do a risky serve right here and now.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.950
A team that chooses that kind of serve when it's all on the line is a team that can improve.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.950
Of course, it's better if they don't mess up, and it's obviously great if the other side messes up,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.380
but it's valuable just to take that chance,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.090
as long as they keep that in mind!
All right!

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.680
Reon!

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.100
Wait for it. Wait for it.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.270
Gimme!

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.480
Ushijima!

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.990
He held back!

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.660
He hit it over the block?!
All right!

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.120
That was more about timing than height.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.000
They jumped up to block a bit too early.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.830
I'm sure the fact that everyone is so tired and impatient is a factor,

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:04.760
but more importantly, Ushiwaka's mid-air form makes it look like he's floating.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.680
And if you have good form, you have an advantage in mid-air.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.430
What the hell?

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.810
Do the concepts of stress or being out of stamina not exist to Ushiwaka?

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:26.280
He's definitely some kind of monster or mutant, but the name we're the most satisfied with...

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.490
is that he's a "super volleyball freak."

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.670
Give us a good serve!

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.210
Bring it!

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.720
Sorry, it's short!

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.970
It's good enough!

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.760
Bring it on!

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.350
Perfect!

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.100
All right!

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.270
It's rare to be so small yet be a core piece of the offense.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.980
He's almost like the Little Gia—

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.190
Bigger will always be better.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.860
That's how nature works.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.370
Give us a good one, Kageyama!

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.740
Go, Kageyama!

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.450
Give us a good serve!

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.540
We're counting on you!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.960
It's good.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.340
This is it!

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.590
If we score here, we win!

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.220
Here's our chance!

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.810
Jump in the direction that smells like the pleasure of victory!

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.270
I...

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.230
want to use my forty years of coaching...

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.860
to deny you,

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.620
Karasuno's number ten.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.500
Psych-tori knows it all!
All right!

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.380
Nice block, Tendou!

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.890
Tendou!

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.480
Karasuno's number ten is being a lot quieter than usual.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.940
He's thinking.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:26.440
He just got shut down at a deuce in the final set,

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.610
and since he can't waste time being sad, he's thinking about his next move.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.490
Shake it off! You'll get it next time!

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.360
Right!

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.620
Makes me sick.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.910
Hold it together, guys.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.960
We'll end up with a good rotation eventually.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:41.830
Go, Tanaka!

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.630
All right!

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.010
Yes! Just one more point!

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.090
Please! Land this serve!

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.800
Here we go!

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.970
Reon!

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.270
Got it!

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.360
Yes!

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.570
He wasn't able to jump.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.820
Looks like number ten's legs are about done too.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.990
You jerk!

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.790
Forgive it, Hinata!

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:22.410
Karasuno's moving through willpower alone at this point.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.250
Wakatoshi's in the front row now, so this is our chance to score twice in a row!

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.210
Here we go!

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.390
You want consecutive points so bad that you can almost taste it.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.220
Yet the moment you get them

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.810
isn't always so dramatic.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.560
I know.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.320
I know that it's going to fall right there,

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.780
but my legs won't move!

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.280
Nishinoya!

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.790
Nishinoya!

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.930
All right!

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.470
Nice spike, Asahi!

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.890
What the hell was that?!

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.100
Wow!

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.520
Thanks, Nishinoya!

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.230
Karasuno can depend on me!

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.480
But there are also things I can't do.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.360
I know I'm asking the impossible,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.360
but even if your thighs split in half, I'm counting on you guys for the mid-air battles.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.620
Right!
Yeah!

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.240
I'm counting on you!
Right.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.920
We've used up all our options for player substitutions.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.920
But right now, the setter's in the back row, and there are three attackers in front.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.090
Give us a good serve, Hinata!

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.180
There are two attackers in back, one of which is Hinata's super-fast back row attack.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.680
This rotation is perfect for attacking.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.970
If they can only find a chance to...

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:09.690
With Nishinoya out and Sawamura in front, their ability to receive is also lacking.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.150
Everything is riding on the blocks.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.030
Hayato!

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.610
I landed it.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.830
Hinata, swap places with me!

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.000
Delayed timing attacks don't work against Four-eyes.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.960
So we'll just have get through the center with sheer speed instead!

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.670
They're going for the center?!

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.590
When you have a brilliant ace, their very existence is a brilliant decoy!

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.970
Go, Taichi!

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.310
Hear me out, Tsukki!

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.810
Kuroo yelled at me and told me to do read blocking again.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:55.190
But don't you think it feels better to be able to shut down your opponent, whether it's by luck or is just a hunch?

00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:01.240
That does feel good, but I hate the ball getting through even more.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:07.160
If you go for the ball, even if your reaction is a little late, it won't get through cleanly.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.500
That sounds like something you'd say.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.460
You probably think it's better if you look cool, don't you?

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.920
You just don't get it.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.300
That's the problem with little kids.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.180
You're only two years older than me!

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.930
Listen up, kiddo!

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:27.350
Read blocking takes persistence and endurance, but it's also...

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.610
the style of blocking where you get the last laugh.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.780
I touched it!

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.740
It almost seems like Tsukishima's reaction time is even faster since he came back.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:52.460
The point of read blocking against a fast attack isn't always to stop the ball, but to get a hand on it.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.210
The glasses brat has gotten by this whole time just by following the ball.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.920
It wouldn't be unusual if he'd gotten used to it.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.050
You can score here!

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.140
There's no other... ...choice... ...but to...

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.310
...attack!

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.690
A minus tempo...

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.900
back row attack!

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:20.610
Go for it!

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:27.030


00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.000


00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.130
Hey, stop shaking your knees.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.000
They're doing that on their own! I can't stop it!

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.420
Quit it, you jerks!

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.760
You get it, right? Since we came this far...

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.640
...we won't hand our opportunity over now!

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.760
Next time on Haikyuu!!:

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.260
"A Battle of Concepts."

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.250
Got a wish that can't be forced through

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.120
Barely hanging on and staying true

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.080
With a little help from timing and your crew

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.840
You can still stay standing

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.840
Wanna take the fight head-on

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.590
Might get lost, but keep on keeping on

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.180
'Cause that's where your chance lies

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.560
The rest is up to you, yes

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.230
The rest is up to you

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.610
Make your dreams and ideals come true

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.360
Or sit tight and let the future pass on through

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.530
The rest is up to you

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.740
You ain't the luckiest of guys

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.160
And you ain't anywhere near wise

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.080
The winds of change are too bright for your eyes

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.420
But you wanna have all the luck

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.960
Stuff all the wisdom junk in your trunk

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.880
And live holding your head up high

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.220
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:36.230
It's all up to you People might call you naive

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.020
And say you're not doing it right

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.900
But the rest is up to you

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.150
Don't lose your way, and push on anew

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.790
It's all up to you

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.350
Light a fire in every cell of your body

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.690
By taking a deep, long breath

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.440
Turn your blood and tears into offerings

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.150
Carry a torch fueled by your desires

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:58.370
And scream out at full volume Let there be light

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.420
With a prayer for the future, start your sprint

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.670
Let there be light, use the dark as your runway

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.300
And sprint through the path you chose

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.680
Let there be light, believe in the glory within your grasp

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.770
And run headlong into the despair in front of you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.940
Let there be light
There is only one reason I kick the ground

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.120
Let there be light

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.200
It is so I shine brighter and soar higher than before

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.210
Let there be light, so that your brilliance of today

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:50.050
Shows your friends who are lost The way to the future

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.720
To those who bear the cross of their dreams

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.980
