WEBVTT

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.750
A massive, massive wall stands in front of me, blocking my way.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.090
I wonder what the view is like on the other side.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.350
What does it look like?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.280
It's something I'll never be able to see alone.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.950
The view from the summit.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.880
Let's go, Hinata.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.980
Yeah!

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:29.990


00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.950


00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.180
Sawamura!

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.890
We came to cheer you on!

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.890
Michimiya! You really came.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.230
Wow! You're going to play in the finals!

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.440
That's amazing! It's so...

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.730
All right. Let's go, everyone.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.520
Crazy!
Okay.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.530
Your lack of vocabulary is what's crazy.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.690
Yui.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.070
U-Um... So, uh, here!

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.780
I mean, it's not just for you.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.950
It's for all of you guys, and we have one too, so it's not like—

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.040
Oh, thanks!

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.670
You're so thoughtful, Michimiya.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.000
Huh? I-It's not a big deal...

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.550
I'll put it on the bench.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.380
Hope you'll cheer us on!

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.630
You can count on us!

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.850
You did good enough by your standards just giving it to him.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.690
Wow...

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.150
You can tell it's the finals.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.360
The place is packed.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.610
This is no time to be scared, Ryuu.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.200
I-I'm not scared.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.040
I want you to picture something.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.830
It's the finals.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.370
We're playing Shiratorizawa.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.380
How do you think you'll do with so many people watching?

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.920
How well? I can't...

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.670
They always look so much cooler when they're good players.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:46.640
Yeah!

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.520
Nishinoya! Tanaka! You're amazing!

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.860
Nishinoya, Tanaka.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.610
Do...

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.490
Do your best out there.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.030
I'm gonna do this, Noya!

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.000
I'm gonna be the hero of the match!

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.790
I'm not gonna let you beat me, Ryuu!

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.880
They seem more fired up than usual.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.920
Hey, stop screaming! You're embarrassing us!

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:21.340
Guts! Guts! Guts! Guts!

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.840
It's actually a bit reassuring that those guys never change.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.050
Shut up, you two!

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.100
Indeed.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.890
Come on, let's go.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.140
Right!

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.020
Hinata, do you need to go to the bathroom?

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.690
I just went!

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.770
Shou!

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.480
I-Izumin! Kouji!

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.530
Yo! It's been a while.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.450
Oh, they're from my junior high volleyball... I mean...

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.490
They're the people who helped me during my volleyball match!

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.620
I was on the basketball team.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.420
I was on the soccer team.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.460
I was wondering why there was someone with really good footwork!

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.880
What the...

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.050
Why's he here?!

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.090
I said the same thing at first.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.810
But you know, he has his reasons... But it's the King.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.310
Are you sure you'll be okay, Shouyou?

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.810
Just watch.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.230
Hey, let's go, Hinata.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.110
Well, I hope you cheer us on.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.400
Do your best!

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.990
You bet!

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.700
We texted, but only about what us two were up to.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.450
I never thought we'd see him here.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.290
Who are they?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.040
So Shou finally made some friends.
You played them in junior high.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.040
Shut up. Like I remember everyone I played against.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.830
Yeah.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.920
And that's exactly why you don't have friends, Kageyama.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.180
What did you say?!

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.550
Hey! Stop it, you two!
We're going to be playing in the finals.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.640
Isn't it stupid of them to be using that energy?

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.890
Well, I guess we might lose right away.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.360
Good grief.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.650
Come on, let's get moving.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.820
As soon as we put our stuff away, we're going to warm up...

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.790
Ow! What the heck, Daic—

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.290
I mean, they lost in the second round last time.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.580
Karasuno couldn't fly or crow.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.170
Hopefully them making it to finals isn't some fluke, either.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.300
What's that old dude's problem? He came here again?

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.470
Do you know him?

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.970
Nah. He would just show up to matches every so often.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.760
He doesn't seem like he's anybody's relative.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.430
Maybe he's just a fan of high school volleyball and likes rooting for Karasuno?

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.020
He'll cheer for plays he thinks were good and boo the bad ones.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.560
Where's Karasuno's fan section?

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.400
He's always been easy to spot.
You should at least make that clear.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.440
Have you guys seen him before?

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.320
Yes.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.990
When we were first-years, he came to a tournament.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.950
We'll never let him call us "clipped crows" again.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.820
All right, here we go!

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.820
Yeah!

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.610
They finally made it here.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.320
Yeah.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.320
Let's give it our all too!

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:33.660
Yeah!

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.960
All right!

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:48.670
Ladies and gentlemen from the Karasuno shopping district, Karasuno Alumni Cheer Squad, and cheer squad hopefuls!

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.800
Let's start by beating Shiratorizawa at cheering!

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.480
Listen up, everyone!

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.560
Two, three, four!

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:03.650
We need to cheer as loud as we can so that our cheers become the players' strength!

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.100
Five, six, seven, eight!

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.110
Yes, sir.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:09.610
The vice principal sure seems worked up about this all of a sudden.
Come on. We need to practice once.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.030
Ready, and... Was he always like that?

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:20.370
Go, go, Karasuno! Push it, push it, Karasuno!

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.830
Hey! We just practiced this yesterday!

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:29.090
Sir, you say we practiced, but it was just a little bit after school.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.140
A-Are they going to be okay?

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.430
We can't panic!

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.680
Look at them!

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.430
See how confident they are?

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.480
I'm going to the bathroom again!

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.060
I-I need an antacid.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.320
Me too... We're playing center court...

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.190
Noya, cheerleaders! They have cheerleaders!
Are you okay, Yamaguchi?!

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.400
I'm so jealous!

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.110
Tanaka, Nishinoya! Will you two shut up already?!

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.410
You guys are panicking way too hard.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.990
E-Every... Everyone, calm...

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.120
This is the Karasuno team?

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.210
I keep telling you, I'm not anyone suspicious!

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:08.000
He was lurking around here and ran when I looked his way, so I chased him down!

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.460
Hey! Stop!

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.340
Maybe he's a spy for Shiratorizawa!

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.470
What?!

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.340
W-Wait! I belong here!

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.050
I'm Tsukishima Kei's older brother!

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.100
Tsukishima's older brother?!

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.850
Shh! Shh!

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.520
He told me not to come!

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.730
Those two are nothing alike.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.360
They give off completely different vibes.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:31.940
Huh?

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.660
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.120
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.460
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:56.840
All right, here we go!

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.390
Our opponent today... ...is Karasuno High School!

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.310
Good luck!

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.020
All right, here we go!

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:25.830
All right, here we go!
Wow... Yeah, they really feel like a powerhouse school.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.880
Come to think of it, Shiratorizawa hasn't shown up yet.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.460
Yeah, they're late.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.090
Damn. Think they're so cool...

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.550
I guess that's what being a champ does.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.680
Do they think so little of us?

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.220
They're here!

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:04.950


00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.970
All right, let's start our meeting.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.100
Hey, I know you're tired from already playing two matches today, but you'd better listen.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.180
Our next match is tomorrow.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.600
First, I'm going to start with my honest opinion.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.900
If the most complete team in the prefecture is Aoba Jousai,

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.570
then Shiratorizawa is the most incomplete.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.530
Incomplete?

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.990
Do you know why I think that?

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:50.500
Because I looked at the file your managers made after they found out everything they could about Shiratorizawa.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.710
Kiyoko did that for me?!

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.760
No, it was for the whole team.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.590
That's really all we can do, anyway.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.100
Right, Hitoka?

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.140
Oh, yes.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.890
We wanted to be of some use to you all.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.350
Thank you, Yachi!

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.560
Don't waste their hard work!

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.770
Clean out those ears and listen!

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:14.570
Yes, sir!

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.320
Um, what do you mean by "incomplete" team?

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.780
If the attacks that we and most other teams are trying to pull off are multiplication,

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.580
then Shiratorizawa's are addition.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.750
They add their strengths together.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:34.290
We use different speeds, positioning, and timings for our attacks to slip through blocks.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.380
Shiratorizawa also varies the timing of their attacks,

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.590
but when the receive is a bit off, or in cases where they really want to score,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.510
they set to their wing spikers without fail.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.470
They especially like giving Ushijima high sets.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.180
There's only one reason for that.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.390
They're sure to score.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.520
Sorry!

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.490
You'll get hit, regardless of how well we're guarding.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.410
And it'll be with power like we've never experienced before.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.830
You'd better be prepared!

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.410
He managed to hit that all the way up here?

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.660
He hits from so high up!

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.040
They simply destroy everything with their one ultimate spear.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.880
That's the kind of team Shiratorizawa is.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:25.840
Though Ushiwaka is their best player, it's not like the rest of the team is ordinary either.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.100
Got it!

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.810
It feels like they're hitting it so lightly, but if I touched it, I bet it'd rip my arm off.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:44.780
Light it up, Wakatoshi!

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.240
Ushiwaka's amazing.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.450
I'm getting excited!

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.410
Yeah.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.870
Light it up, Eita!

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.580
Yeah!

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.290
Thanks!

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:06.470
Light it up, Satori!

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.380
It's Benkei.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.970
That dude's name has to be Benkei!

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:05.880
Reon.
What's up?

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.930
Reon?!

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.560
That little kid totally started calling you "Benkei."

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.980
Sorry to shatter your dreams.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.190
So that's half of Karasuno's first-year fast attack duo?

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.900
What, really?!

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.280
Bring it!

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.820
Look! There's a tiny kid!

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.110
I wonder if he's a sub.
Nice spike!

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.870
I sort of feel bad for him.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.080
I always feel like cheering for the underdog.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.540
Nice spike!

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.210
Hey, you two.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.670
Do that thing you did yesterday!

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.340
But I can say the following with confidence.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.010
We definitely won't lose when it comes to scoring points!

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.720
The first step...

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.220
is getting the brawl under control.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.730
That shorty hit it straight down!

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.520
More importantly, it was so fast!

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.360
Did the setter even touch it?

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.820
I was surprised that Seijou didn't make it this year,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.700
but Karasuno's pretty interesting too.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.820
Yeah.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.700
It doesn't matter who we're up against. We'll shut them down!

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.660
Talk big when you can actually back it up.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.330
Now, now...

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.920
As always, your words are as cool as your bangs, Tsutomu.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.050
Thanks!

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.550
I think you babying him is exactly the problem.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.010
You're so stiff, Taichi!

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.050
I have a lot of faith in this one.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:36.180
I mean, he's a starter as a first-year, and he's going to be our ace!

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.730
I'll do my best to not let you down!

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.980
Right. Do your best, future ace.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.940
You're just inflating his ego with that talk.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.450
We're receiving first.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.280
We're counting on you yet again, Wakatoshi.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.530
You need to work harder.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.790
Don't just rely on Wakatoshi.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.500
What are you, his right arm? Or maybe you really are Benkei?

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.620
Ushijima!

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:06.210
I'll prove that I'm the one who should be called the ace in these finals.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.090
Yeah. Do your best.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.560
He actually said that seriously, so he comes off as a bit of a jerk.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.520
Their starting lineup is just as we expected.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.980
Did you memorize their profiles?

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:24.730
Yes, sir!

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.820
Don't let it get to you if Ushijima scores.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.360
Just keep calm and get it back.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.650
That's all you need to do!

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.660
He's not a machine.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.200
He'll definitely start to make mistakes.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.330
You know what you need to do, right?

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.410
Yes, sir!

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.790
All right, everyone.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.290
This is the finals.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.630
Since we've come this far, let's win and go to nationals!

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.090
Yeah!

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:57.310
We will now begin the Japanese National High School Volleyball Tournament,

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:02.140
Miyagi Prefecture Qualifiers, Boys' Finals.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.230
The match will be Miyagi Prefectural Karasuno High School

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:11.190
versus Shiratorizawa Academy.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.160
It's finally starting.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.580
Oh man, Shou really made it to the finals.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.370
Is that dude on the other team really still in high school?!

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.340
Wow, there are tons of TV crews here.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:34.430
We will now introduce the Karasuno High School starting lineup.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.220
Number one, Sawamura Daichi.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.600
Number three, Azumane Asahi.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.820
Number five, Tanaka Ryuunosuke.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.320
Ryuu!
Yeah!

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.620
Number nine, Kageyama Tobio.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.580
Number ten, Hinata Shouyou.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.210
Number eleven, Tsukishima Kei.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.170
Kei!
Hey, stop!

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.840
Number four, libero, Nishinoya Yuu.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.930
Yeah!

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.850
Coach, Takeda Ittetsu.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:32.530
Next, we will introduce the Shiratorizawa Academy starting lineup.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.610
Number one, Ushijima Wakatoshi.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.320
Ushijima!
Waka!

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.160
Number four, Oohira Reon.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.160
Number five, Tendou Satori.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.750
Yay!

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.500
Number eight, Goshiki Tsutomu.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.550
Number ten, Shirabu Kenjirou.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.350
Number twelve, Kawanishi Taichi.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.350
Number fourteen, libero, Yamagata Hayato.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.310
Yeah!

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.980
Coach, Washijou Tanji.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:19.570
Ladies and gentlemen, please cheer on both teams and wish them good luck.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.540
I think their nerves are contagious.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:28.960
I thought they were doing okay when I saw the one spike Hinata made after their warmup.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.960
The other team's done this a million times before.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.550
On the other hand, Karasuno is in the finals and playing center court for the first time.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.510
You can't blame them for being nervous.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.430
If this is their first finals, have they never played a best-of-five before?

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:44.470
Best-of-five?

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.440
Up until now, they played best-of-threes and the first to two sets won.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.150
In the finals, they play a best-of-five and the first to three sets wins,

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.440
just like the pro matches you see on TV.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.440
What?! That's gonna be super tiring!

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.990
Yeah.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.400
I'm worried about their stamina.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.120
We can't be the ones who're getting depressed!

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.790
This is a different start than usual.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.540
Usually they put Hinata or someone else who's good with serves in the front.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.800
I guess they're going to try to match up their tallest blockers against Ushijima.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.760
It'll be interesting to see how they deal with his spikes too.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.180
Bring it!

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:34.440
But someone on a team that cannot even make it to the prefecture finals because they lost to Aoba Jousai

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.650
can say all they want, but I will make nothing of it.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.740
Give us a good serve, Daichi!

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:56.880
Got it!

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:58.550
Ushijima!

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:02.930
Here it comes!

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.940
I got it.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.700
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.030
Ushijima! Ushijima!

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.580
Shake it off!

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.740
Get the next one!

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.920
Hello there, Left.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:42.010


00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:11.970


00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.430
So, what's up with your disguise?

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.100
A hat and huge sunglasses are like the classic disguise!

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.730
That reminds me, Kageyama wore a similar disguise once.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.150
See?

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.980
That just means you're both simpletons.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.070
Next time on Haikyuu!!:

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.570
"The Threat of 'Left.'"

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.220
Got a wish that can't be forced through

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.100
Barely hanging on and staying true

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.060
With a little help from timing and your crew

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.810
You can still stay standing

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.810
Wanna take the fight head-on

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.560
Might get lost, but keep on keeping on

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.150
'Cause that's where your chance lies

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.530
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.160
The rest is up to you

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.580
Make your dreams and ideals come true

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.330
Or sit tight and let the future pass on through

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.500
The rest is up to you

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.710
You ain't the luckiest of guys

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.130
And you ain't anywhere near wise

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:29.050
The winds of change are too bright for your eyes

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.390
But you wanna have all the luck

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.930
Stuff all the wisdom junk in your trunk

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:39.860
And live holding your head up high

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.190
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:51.200
It's all up to you People might call you naive

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.000
And say you're not doing it right

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.870
But the rest is up to you

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.130
Don't lose your way, and push on anew

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.760
It's all up to you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.330
Light a fire in every cell of your body

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.660
By taking a deep, long breath

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.420
Turn your blood and tears into offerings

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.130
Carry a torch fueled by your desires

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:56.350
And scream out at full volume Let there be light

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.390
With a prayer for the future, start your sprint

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.650
Let there be light, use the dark as your runway

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.280
And sprint through the path you chose

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.660
Let there be light, believe in the glory within your grasp

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.750
And run headlong into the despair in front of you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.920
Let there be light
There is only one reason I kick the ground

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.090
Let there be light

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.180
It is so I shine brighter and soar higher than before

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.180
Let there be light, so that your brilliance of today

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.980
Shows your friends who are lost The way to the future

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.690
To those who bear the cross of their dreams

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.950
The warriors who seek eternal glory Let there be light
