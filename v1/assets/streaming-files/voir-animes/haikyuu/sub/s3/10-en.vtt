00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:00.310


00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.400


00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.540
We've used up all our options for player substitutions.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.540
But right now, the setter's in the back row, and there are three attackers in front.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.790
Give us a good serve, Hinata!

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.800
There are two attackers in back, one of which is Hinata's super-fast back row attack.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.300
This rotation is perfect for attacking.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.550
If they can only find a chance to...

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.810
With Nishinoya out and Sawamura in front, their ability to receive is also lacking.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.730
Everything is riding on the blocks.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.690
Got it!
Hayato!

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.360
I landed it.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.320
Hinata, swap places with me!

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.370
Delayed timing attacks don't work against Four-eyes.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.540
So we'll just have get through the center with sheer speed instead!

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.750
They're going for the center?!

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.170
Listen up, kiddo!

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.300
Read blocking takes persistence and endurance, but it's also...

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.510
the style of blocking where you get the last laugh.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.940
I touched it!

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.860
You can score here!

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.690
There's no other...

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.780
...choice...

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.950
...but to...

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.110
...attack!

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.450
A minus tempo...

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.700
back row attack!

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.410
Go for it!

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.370
Jump for it, Taichi!

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.630
Shirabu!

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.220
Right!

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.680
A straight spike!

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.760
Ready, and... jump!

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.520
Hinata!

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.560
Kageyama, get the last hit!

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.810
Hinata, are you okay?

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.900
Yeah!

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.610
It's in!

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.780
Got it!

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.820
They returned it to a terrible spot.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.780
There's no time to hesitate!

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.240
Ushijima!

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.370
Back him up!

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.870
This set isn't going up for me.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.960
That's frustrating.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.130
But...

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.130
it's also frustrating because I want to see him spike.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.590
We're going to stop him!

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.270
This is their first three-person block today where they're trying to stop a straight spike...

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.600
Ready, and... jump!

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.690
Whenever we do three-person blocks, we always shut down the cross-court spike,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.730
but for the very last one, let's get in front of a straight spike.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.030
It'll be a trap we spend a set or more setting up.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.330
Out of the dozens of three-person blocks we've done today,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.790
we've always left a hole where a straight spike would go.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.250
We can't mess up this timing.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.250
We won't let him hit it over us.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.340
Ushiwaka knows that this is the one spot where he can comfortably hit a straight spike.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.600
Even though his form is falling apart...

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.940
He changed to a cross-court spike at the last second!

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.870
Damn it... Damn it!

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.040
He's so damn cool!

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.510
Finish it off, Asahi!

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.360
This is our chance to score!

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.320
Watch number ten!

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.330
He's not running up?

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.750
He's slowing down his tempo,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.210
from minus tempo to first tempo,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.880
and then...

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.500
blending in.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.590
Shit!

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.510
Volleyball is a sport where height is king.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.640
Tall players have a clear advantage.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.020
Perfecting each individual player's skills is one way to win,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.020
and so is finding new ways to fight.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.860
That's exactly why there are so many different attacks and defenses today.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.120
There truly are various ways to win.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.250
The great coach Arie Selinger once said,

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:23.170
"There is no reason to not believe that advancement and revolution will come in the future."

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.420
What?! Seriously?!

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.170
That's my little brother!

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.590
The one with the glasses!

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.050
They did it...

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.800
They really did it.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.690
Tsukki!

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.040
Farewell, my paradise.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.250
Hey, it's time to line up.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.710
I-I can't stand...

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.590
Come on, Shouyou!

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.420
You can do it!

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.140
Thank you very much for the match!

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.150
Talk about an upset.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:15.700
Ushiwaka, you bastard. At least try to look a little sadder!

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.120
Thank you very much!

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.300
Is Karasuno's number ten about as tall as I am?

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.340
Huh? Yes, I believe so.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.760
He'll probably continue to grow, though.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.270
The loftier his goals get,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.480
the more treacherous his path will be.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.730
Sorry, Hinata.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.820
We were trying to get in front of that straight spike, but we didn't make it in time.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.020
Are you okay?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.900
Totally fine!

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.820
It's because you gave Ushiwaka little choice where to hit it that he was able to dig it out.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.200
Rather, get his head in the way of it.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.280
Kageyama does good work.
Don't rephrase it!

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.080
Did you notice it too, Iwa?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.290
Apparently when Four-eyes came back, he gave them some kind of directions about blocking.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.800
Like getting in front of Ushiwaka's straight spike.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:14.470
That's why after the serve, Tobio suddenly switched places with Shorty, who was in the path of a cross-court spike.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.470
He had to make up for Nishinoya not being there.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.180
And then he returned the ball at the last moment.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.980
Your student's not bad.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.190
He's not my student!

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.520
And on top of all that,

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.900
he was able to adjust to Shorty, who wanted to do a different spike than usual.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.160
It's painfully obvious.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.120
Well, all of their good work was only possible

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.080
because of the blocks of that first-year with the glasses.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:48.340
I guess that in the end, Shorty is a spiker you end up wanting to set the ball to.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.750
Keeps Tobio on his toes.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.800
Come on, let's go home.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.470
I'd rather die than see the awards ceremony.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.890
You really are a piece of shit.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.440
Thank you for all of your support!

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.980
Thank you very much!

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.480
Well done!

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.940
Great job, you guys!

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.030
I love ya, Ryuu!

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.000
Shouyou!
Shou!

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.080
Sawamura! Sugawara! Azumane!

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.500
Congratulations on winning!

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.350
Thank you very much!

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.190
Kenjirou, are you all right?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.400
Yes.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.530
I just feel a little dizzy.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.990
I never thought we'd lose.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.750
Well, no one here thought we could lose.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.400
We'll have a meeting when we get back.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.860
Once the awards ceremony is over, get on the bus.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.490
Yes, sir.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.200
And you'll be hitting a hundred serves later.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.550
Great job, you guys!

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.510
I'm...

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.220
I'm... sho happwy...

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:01.930
Sawamura!

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.680
Great job...

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.390
Great job with that three-man block at the end!

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.730
But even if your thighs split in half, I'm counting on you guys for the mid-air battles.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.400
I was keeping a promise.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.150
Tsukishima!

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.950
No matter what anyone says, you're the MVP today!

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:29.200
I'm always the MVP, but I'll let you have that title just for today, Tsukishima.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.120
You're definitely the mental MVP.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:43.260
Wakatoshi, you got pissed off at the end, didn't you?

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.640
Usually, you'd regroup or leave it to someone else in that situation.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.850
I got goosebumps thinking they might actually block it.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.360
I wanted to say to him, "I'm better than you."

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.870
Is that childish of me?

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.330
Still, I wanted to say it.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.250
Aren't most people's motivations pretty childish?

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.340
That was a great straight spike.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.340
It felt like I got to see a new side to you.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.720
I'm gonna quit volleyball after high school,

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:32.640
but I'll be watching you on TV and bragging that we were best buds,

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.270
so do your best.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.690
Yeah.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.150
When Passionate People makes a documentary about you,

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.530
you totally have my permission to let them interview me as an old comrade.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:44.530
Okay.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.370
Ushijima was so damn cool.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.590
Hinata Shouyou from the concrete, and Kageyama Tobio.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.010
I'll defeat you next time.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.850
I'll make sure I'm able to stand toe-to-toe with you!

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.020
I'll make you say that I'm better than Oikawa!

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.410
Tsukki, the awards ceremony is starting.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.620
Is something wrong?

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:43.380
I said I would stop at least a few of his spikes, but I was only able to stop one.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.380
And we played five sets.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.380
Talk about...

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:48.590
lame—

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.350
You weren't lame at all!

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.220
Are you stupid?!

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.260
Stu—

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.640
You don't have time to be down in the dumps!

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.350
We're going to nationals!

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.520
But before that, the awards ceremony!

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:19.080
And now, I present this award to the victors: Miyagi Prefectural Karasuno High School.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:26.170
Concluding the Miyagi Prefecture Qualifiers of the National High School Volleyball Tournament,

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.930
your team has emerged victorious.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:34.720
I present this award to commend your performance.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.350
Congratulations!

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.610
To praise both teams for their performance,

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.820
and to wish the best to Karasuno High School for their upcoming performance

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:56.830
at the National High School Volleyball Tournament in January at Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium,

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:02.500
I'd like to ask the audience to give them another large round of applause.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.840
Let's go...

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.300
Let's go...

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:12.390
Let's go...

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.260
to the spring tournament!

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.990
I'm pretty sure I saw my relative's one-year-old do the same thing just the other day.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.110
Tanaka, wake up!

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.910
Kiyoko's scolding me...

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.250
You guys need to decide if you're going to eat or sleep!

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.330
Ukai, I'm... sho happwy!

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.130
Sir, your face is a mess.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.630
And that's the eighth time you've said that.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:49.210
I'm so sorry.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.840
They played like their lives depended on it.
Make sure you guys don't break any plates.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.470
And now, we're the ones who are gonna have it rough.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.560
It's gonna get real busy.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:05.360


00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.620
Our volleyball team is going to nationals?

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.660
You guys didn't go to the match, did you? It was awesome!

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.920
Our boys' volleyball team was a powerhouse to begin with.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.840
Really?

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.840
I heard there was a really scary third-year on the team.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.550
There's a second-year that looks like a punk too, isn't there?

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.140
Are you really okay, Hinata?

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.510
Their manager is so pretty!

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.310
Really?!

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.020
Where are they holding nationals?

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.690
Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium!

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.520
That's awesome!

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.230
I know, right?

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.740
Looks like the idiot's really getting a big head.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.990
Are you going too, Hinata?

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.240
Of course!

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.660
He's in charge of holding the players' belongings, running errands, and doing their laundry.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.450
So he's an errand boy for the scary people.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.410
I'm going to play in the matches!

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.580
Really? Well, good luck.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.380
You don't believe me?!

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.130
Hitoka, what are you drawing?

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.970
A rough sketch of the volleyball team's poster.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.090
Oh...

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.930
Next period's in a different classroom. I'm gonna go ahead.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.930
Got it! I'll be right there.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.640
That sounds rough.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.400
Is that the manager's job too?

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.650
Who knows?

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.270
But she seemed to be having fun.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.420
The representative teams from Tokyo are about to be decided, right?

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:49.790
Yeah.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.760
I think for Tokyo, four schools advance out of the prelims,

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.720
and then those teams play in November to decide the representatives.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.800
I think that Nekoma and Fukurodani both made it.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.600
It's amazing that they're two of the four teams that advanced in Tokyo.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.480
It makes me realize we went to a training camp with some really crazy guys.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.230
We're gonna beat Nekoma!

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.190
Right, Kageyama?

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.400
That's if they make it through the qualifiers.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.700
Of course they will!

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.290
We're gonna play like it's our absolute last shot

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.830
at the spring tourney!

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:33.250


00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:02.680


00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.510
Mr. Takeda, you've got a call.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.640
It's on line 2.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.100
Hello, this is Takeda. I hope I didn't keep you long.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.890
Yes.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.150
Oh, yes!

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.020
Thank you for calling.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.650
Yes. Yes.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.190
Huh?

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.700
What are they doing?

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:35.580
They're measuring the highest point they can hit for the spring tournament pamphlet.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.120
That was 302 cm.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.300
Oh? I guess that's what you do when you're going to nationals.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.800
Next, Kageyama.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.220
Um...

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.180
337 cm.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.810
Right now, Kageyama's in the lead.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.320
And there's only one person remaining...

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.320
Next, Hinata.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:02.860
Right!

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.410
How high?

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.660
How high did he get?!

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.000
Just wait!

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.210
Um...

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.920
333 cm.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.130
Yes!

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.340
That's about the same as you, Asahi.
You owe me three curry buns.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.600
Damn it. I'm not gonna lose.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.430
Next, let's compete to see who can get the most blocks!

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.180
The loser buys the winner Gungun Yogurt for a week!

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.060
You're on!

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.480
Is everyone here?

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.610
Gather 'round!

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.980
Yessir!

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.070
Thank you all for your hard work.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:47.110
This is sudden, but I have some big news.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.280
Kageyama,

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.330
you've been asked to attend the All-Japan Youth Training Camp.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.330
All... Japan?!

00:24:00.170 --> 00:20:36.420
Youth... Got a wish that can't be forced through

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.300
Barely hanging on and staying true

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.260
With a little help from timing and your crew

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.010
You can still stay standing

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.020
Wanna take the fight head-on

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.770
Might get lost, but keep on keeping on

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.110
'Cause that's where your chance lies

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.490
The rest is up to you, yes

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.410
The rest is up to you

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.740
Make your dreams and ideals come true

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.540
Or sit tight and let the future pass on through

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.710
The rest is up to you

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.000
You ain't the luckiest of guys

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.420
And you ain't anywhere near wise

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.260
The winds of change are too bright for your eyes

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.590
But you wanna have all the luck

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.140
Stuff all the wisdom junk in your trunk

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:31.100
And live holding your head up high

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.110
The rest is up to you, yes

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:42.610
It's all up to you People might call you naive

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.240
And say you're not doing it right

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.120
But the rest is up to you

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.330
Don't lose your way, and push on anew

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.960
It's all up to you

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.240
Light a fire in every cell of your body

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.570
By taking a deep, long breath

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Turn your blood and tears into offerings

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.040
Carry a torch fueled by your desires

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:27.260
And scream out at full volume Let there be light

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.300
With a prayer for the future, start your sprint

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.560
Let there be light, use the dark as your runway

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.190
And sprint through the path you chose

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.570
Let there be light, believe in the glory within your grasp

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.660
And run headlong into the despair in front of you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.830
Let there be light
There is only one reason I kick the ground

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.000
Let there be light

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.090
It is so I shine brighter and soar higher than before

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.090
Let there be light, so that your brilliance of today

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.930
Shows your friends who are lost The way to the future

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.610
To those who bear the cross of their dreams

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.400
The warriors who seek eternal glory Let there be light
