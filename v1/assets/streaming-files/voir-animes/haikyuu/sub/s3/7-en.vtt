WEBVTT

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.070
It's short!

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.250
Nice save.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.920
More importantly, Kageyama.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.590
We get to play another set!

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.010


00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.010


00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.390
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.980
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.190
Keep playing badly and I'll have you all sprint home!

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.860
We actually had to do that when I was a first-year.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.240
It was after the third-years' farewell match.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.410
The only reason you need to win is that you are who you are.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm confident in the members I picked for this team.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.540
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.880
Shiratorizawa!
For the final set,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.260
I'm thinking about having Sugawara start.
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.640
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.430
Yes, sir!
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.180
We're counting on you, Sugawara!
It'll be fine.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.180
I don't have to panic.
Sugawara, give it your all!

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.730
They've put me in during tough spots before.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.020
Suga, give me a whole bunch of sets!

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.480
Shiratorizawa!
Shit.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.360
My body's warmed up, but my hands are cold.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.360
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.200
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.410
Shiratorizawa!

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.630
I-I'm not ready to get married yet!

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.710
Don't worry.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.000
I don't plan on marrying you, Sugawara.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.840
You don't know that for sure!

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.800
I'll hold your hand for you.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.550
No, I'll do it.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.100
No! Stop! Shimizu's scent's gonna go away!

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.270
Shut up! You can't hog it all for yourself!

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.350
They look like they're going to be just fine.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.520
Stop!

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.240
The final set is upon us.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.110
Sugawara's starting?

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.070
I-I'm even more nervous now.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.540
Kageyama seems like he's pretty exhausted.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.540
They're probably going to let him rest and put him back in when they need him the most.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.040
That only works if they can make it that far.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.670
This might be a bit much for Mr. Refreshing.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.510
Huh? You're changing your setter?

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.760
That's no fun.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.850
If you aren't sure what to do, just set the ball to me.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.770
Well, aren't you reliable! What are you, the ace?

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.150
Yes, I am!

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.780
We're counting on you, Tsutomu.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.320
You can do it, future ace!

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.360
Right!

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.240
Let's stop them here!

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.820
Yeah!

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.330
Sorry!

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.580
Asahi!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.590
All right!

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.090
The fifth set only goes up to 15 points, right?

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.880
It does?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.930
Yeah, it goes by in a flash.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.390
Hopefully they can go all the way without Shiratorizawa catching up.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.770
Sugawara is a dependable setter.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.180
He won't fall apart!

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.060
Yeah!

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.600
Or so we hope!

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.360
It's Ushiwaka!

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.570
All right!

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.490
Damn it.
Give us a good serve, Taichi!

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.200
This pressure is insane.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.160
Move up!

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.420
Got it!

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.840
Sorry!

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.550
That set was low. I have to stop panicking!

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.680
It's definitely going to be to the left.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.510
It's going out!

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.970
D'oh!

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.270
The middle was covered, so you picked the safe choice and went left for the second time.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.900
You're so easy to read!

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.020
Well, our left wing spikers are pretty great!

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.110
Oh, I just want to break your heart.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.990
We have good spikers.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.780
I know that more than anyone.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.500
Give us a good serve, Asahi!

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.170
Got it!

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.470
Our team is plenty good.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.510
But...

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.350
Nishinoya!

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.480
...we don't stop there!

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.480
They're having the libero set while doing a synchronized attack with everyone else?!

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.360
Asahi!

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.570
There's still a little time left, so could you hit some of my sets?

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.450
Noya! Let me hit a few too!

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.490
Sounds good, Ryuu!

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.950
Oh, me too.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.660
You'll throw them up for us, Suga?

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.660
That'll be perfect!

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.120
Um, not exactly.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.880
I'm gonna spike.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.140
All right!

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.310
All of them...

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.100
They didn't leave anyone back to dig out a block?

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.980
Yeah!

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.360
Looks like we didn't have to worry about him falling apart.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.320
Nice one, Suga! I love ya!

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.320
Looks like our minds were a bit closed off.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.570
My weapon is my reliability.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.280
But...

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.030
I can do new things too!

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.830
Yes! We scored back-to-back points!

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.660
Nice spike, Suga!

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.200
Yeah!
You did it!

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.040
Satori!

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.090
How many times do I have to tell you?! Don't jump just on instinct!

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.550
But I've scored a lot of points with just my instincts.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.010
That's not always going to work.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.510
There's a limit to how far individual skills will take you.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.850
If it doesn't feel good to me, there's no point.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.480
Practice just comes to a dead halt when Tendou's around.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.190
Though it's nice to be able to rest.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.440
Actually, he's kinda scary.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.240
You never know what he's thinking.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.700
I know, right?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.370
I just want to play volleyball that makes me feel good.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.790
As long as you can score, I don't have any complaints.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.000
Keep on breaking them!

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.920
What, you say?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.640
Their hearts...

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:19.940


00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.990
Hey, Wakatoshi, you see that "Ring" movie last week?

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.660
I didn't.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:40.120
It's scary, but I ended up watching it because the leading actress, Brunhilde Reiko, is super cute!

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.040
I see.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.710
Isn't Brunhilde Reiko cute?

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.960
The only person who could excitedly talk to Wakatoshi about something on TV is Satori.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.960
I don't know who that is.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.260
But you know, I'm not sure about the other girl, at least in my opinion.
One of them doesn't look too excited, no matter how you look at it.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.600
You never look like you're having fun doing anything, Wakatoshi.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.220
That's so rude!

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.970
Why'd you start playing volleyball?

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.690
My father taught me a bit about how to play.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.940
Really?!

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.940
I thought it'd be better to fix his left-handedness early on.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.950
What? No, that's not necessary.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.410
We've done it in our family for generations.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.960
I'm sorry, but please... anything but that.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.340
The fact that he's different from other people will probably become his source of strength.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.970
I won't complain about anything else!

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.800
Your dad played volleyball?

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.310
Yeah, he played on a second division team.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.890
But apparently, before he got married, he got injured quite often and retired.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.270
Really? What's his name?

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.610
Utsui Takashi.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.690
Never heard of him.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.070
Wait, so his name isn't Ushijima?

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.070
He took my mom's name when they got married.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.820
Though my parents got divorced a while back.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.450
Huh? Oh, sorry.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.240
It's fine.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.700
Do you ever see him?

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.700
No. He's overseas right now.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.460
Wow, that's so cool!

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.500
Then if you become a star, he'll see you play!

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.670
Perhaps.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.970
I think back in your dad's time, Shiratorizawa won nationals.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.010
Seriously?! That's awesome!

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.260
So, did you want to be like your dad?

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.100
No, not really.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.310
I see.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.930
It's just...

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.770
Our ace was literally the best ace in Japan.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.110
Back then, he was 190 cm tall.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.860
He was a third-year, yet he was still growing.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.950
But that wasn't why he was good.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.740
He made you think that if you set the ball to him, he'd never disappoint you.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.710
He'd make it work out somehow.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.000
It made you get all excited.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.670
I wanted to be like that.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.430
All right!

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.480
Why don't you do that too, Kageyama?

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.890
I can't.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.400
I haven't practiced that.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.480
I haven't practiced working with Nishinoya.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.490
Already? That was fast!

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.410
Well, once someone takes the lead in the fifth set, it's over in no time.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.950
Take those points back!

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:19.870
That's all.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.120
Yes, sir!

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.620
Karasuno sure does some reckless attacks.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.710
Yeah.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.920
I've never seen a libero set and then everyone else comes in to attack.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.010
You're impressed by that, but you don't like their number ten, huh?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.850
I'm guessing you don't like him because he's so enigmatic, right?

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.970
Things you don't understand are scary.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.890
I'm not scared.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.390
No, no, but at the very least you don't like him!

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.690
And that's a new feeling for you, isn't it?

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.660
Do it again, Asahi!

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.000
Th-This time, we hit the net and just barely made it over!

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.260
Do that again!

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.470
Yes! He broke through!

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.230
How beautiful.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.190
All right!

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.900
The fact that he's different from other people

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.280
will probably become his source of strength.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.000
Give us a good serve again, Ushijima!

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.910
Wakatoshi!

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.130
We're counting on you to hit a hard one!

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.050
Bring it!

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.600
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.270
Sorry!

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.430
We'll get the next one!

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.980
You have to stop him here!

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.270
If they get any more points, we're in trouble!

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.070
Daichi!

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.740
Suga, get the last hit!

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.910
He got the setter to receive it. Nice!

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.040
Tendou!

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.910
Righto!

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.710
Hup.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:52.230
I thought he'd definitely hit to me, given which way his body was facing,

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.730
but he changed his aim at the last possible second.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.360
Join a good team.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.030
Nice set, me!

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.320
Talented and interesting players gather in a good environment.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.650
Nice aim!

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.490
And if you become better, you'll be able to go up against all kinds of people.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.410
Talented players, weird players, and new players.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.290
I'm sure that they'll make you better.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.890
Well, that's only if you want to continue playing volleyball.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:31.810
No matter what form it takes, I'll be happy if you like it.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.440
That was some really nice aim.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.110
It was amazing.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.440
To borrow Tendou's words for a second...

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.160
I'm starting to get into it!

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.130
It's going out!

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.010
All right!

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.720
Shiratorizawa took back the lead!

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.180
Wakatoshi's serves can still be pretty erratic,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.680
but he's doing amazingly today.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.480
Looks like you lit a fire under our ace.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.650
He got it!

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.490
Get the ball back over the net!

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:28.870
Here's our chance to score!

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.000
Ushiwaka from the back row?

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.050
I touched it!

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.550
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.180
So annoying... Ushijima!

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:51.970
Thanks!

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.350
That was close.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.980
Usually, you want to jump up when the spiker looks like they're going to hit it right in front of you,

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.740
but Tsukishima typically doesn't fall for decoys.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.610
So he's read blocking.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.950
Wherever the set goes, Tsukishima will be there.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:15.290
Having a wall pop up in front of you no matter what must be extremely discomforting.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.170
And if that keeps happening over the course of five sets,

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.090
it'll end up being pretty stressful for even the most unflappable person.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.050
In front!

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.760
We can score here!

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.730
What?!

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.940
You're not getting through.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.150
Let's try again!

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.780
I touched it!

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.990
He's just like Aone!

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.280
Nice contact!

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.950
Damn, Tsukki is so freaking reliable!

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.500
Here's our chance!

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:00.620
He predicted what I'd do?!

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.090
Setting to the middle blocker when there's a block waiting is scary, right? I get it.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:09.010
That's why you set to the left wing spiker. Yep. Totally understandable.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.470
Let's...

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:14.680
go...

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.640
again!

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.100
His concentration is amazing.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.560
With such a long rally and their exhaustion,

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.520
it wouldn't be weird if their bodies were moving faster than their minds.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.690
But he's taking in just the info he needs!

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.580
Nice aim...

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.420
It's out?!

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.460
Sorry.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.000
I-It's fine.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.880
He made a mistake?! So lucky!

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.970
Luck has nothing to do with it!

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.640
That mistake is proof of how hard he was trying to avoid the block!

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.850
Huh?

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.810
What? It was overturned?

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.770
What?

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.230
The ball just barely hit the block.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.320
It's Shiratorizawa's point.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.520
Seriously?!

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.610
They're on the right track, though!

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:10.990
Get refocused, guys!

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.910
Um...

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.790
There's something wrong with his hand.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.410
Damn it.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.000
What?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.550
It must've been cut when you touched Ushiwaka's spike.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.430
At least I hope that's all it is.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.060
Narita!

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.600
Y-Yes, sir!

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.100
Damn. Talk about bad timing.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.730
Thankfully, it was just my pinky. If I can just endure the pain...

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.360
How long until it stops bleeding?

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.940
If we just tape it up...

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.780
The next rotation will have Hinata in the front row.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.070
I need to figure something out by then.
Get him to the infirmary.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.320
Oh dear. He got hurt?

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.540
It'll hurt the team more having him out this late in the match.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.380
You'd better buy me some time!

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.420
By the time you get back, we'll already be bound for nationals!

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.060
All right! Concentrate!

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:23.980
Right!

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.940
Kazuhito! You're not alone in your blocks!

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.480
I'll be right behind you!

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.360
Right!

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.940
Don't hold back and go for it, just like we practiced!

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.780
Right!

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.360
Looks like he had to leave.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.450
But we're not gonna hold back.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.620
Of course not.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.200
Kei!

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.460
What are you doing here?

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.540
Though I knew you were.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.920
I came to see my younger brother fight bravely, of course!

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.550
Though it looks like you're not going to die from that.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.340
Why would I die?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.090
Even if I'm not dead, I'm being pretty useless when it matters most.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:04.020
On the other hand, I'm pretty tired after playing five sets, so it's sort of nice to be able to rest.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.310
Even though my hand hurts.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.530
"My teammates can win without me!"

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.660
You just have to believe that.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.490
Don't worry.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:26.960
You don't have to worry about going back just to see them lose.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.800
I guess Tsukishima can make that kind of face now.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.760
If we don't show them what we're made of now, we never will!

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.050
Bring it.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.890
Bring it.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.140
Bring it.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.350
Bring it!

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.400
Nice, Daichi!

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.200
Center!

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.210
He's doing it again!

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.170
I hate doing setter dumps. They're scary.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.460
It's the same with spikes.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:19.630
I can't risk messing up if I try to step outside my usual role.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.600
But you have to risk something if you want a reward!

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.470
Karasuno is only Karasuno when we're persistently attacking!

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.230
Right!

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.060
Full-team synchronized attack!

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.360
Go!

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.490
Don't join our team, Tendou!

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.860
Monsters aren't allowed on human teams!

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.950
Yeah, he does look like a monster.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.220
Good job predicting what they'd do, Satori.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.180
It was just a hunch.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.150
Ever since I first saw that expression,

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.820
I haven't been satisfied by just deflecting the ball.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:26.910


00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:56.920


00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.130
What're you doing, Tendou?

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:00.420
Look at this.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.710
Isn't my haircut from when I was a kid super fashionable?

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.380
Whoa, is that really you?! It's the same as Tsutomu's!

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.170
Did you call?

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.760
Don't look! You'll end up wanting to get a bowl cut!

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.680
Next time on Haikyuu!!:

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.890
"An Annoying Guy."

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.120
Got a wish that can't be forced through

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.000
Barely hanging on and staying true

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.960
With a little help from timing and your crew

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.670
You can still stay standing

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.710
Wanna take the fight head-on

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.470
Might get lost, but keep on keeping on

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.050
'Cause that's where your chance lies

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.430
The rest is up to you, yes

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.060
The rest is up to you

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.480
Make your dreams and ideals come true

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.230
Or sit tight and let the future pass on through

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.400
The rest is up to you

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.620
You ain't the luckiest of guys

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.040
And you ain't anywhere near wise

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.960
The winds of change are too bright for your eyes

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.250
But you wanna have all the luck

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.840
Stuff all the wisdom junk in your trunk

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:24.760
And live holding your head up high

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.090
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:36.100
It's all up to you People might call you naive

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.900
And say you're not doing it right

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.780
But the rest is up to you

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.030
Don't lose your way, and push on anew

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:51.660
It's all up to you

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.340
Light a fire in every cell of your body

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.680
By taking a deep, long breath

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.440
Turn your blood and tears into offerings

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.150
Carry a torch fueled by your desires

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:52.370
And scream out at full volume Let there be light

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.410
With a prayer for the future, start your sprint

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.670
Let there be light, use the dark as your runway

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.300
And sprint through the path you chose

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.680
Let there be light, believe in the glory within your grasp

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.770
And run headlong into the despair in front of you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.940
Let there be light
There is only one reason I kick the ground

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.110
Let there be light

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.190
It is so I shine brighter and soar higher than before

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.200
Let there be light, so that your brilliance of today

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:44.000
Shows your friends who are lost The way to the future

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.710
To those who bear the cross of their dreams

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.010
The warriors who seek eternal glory Let there be light
