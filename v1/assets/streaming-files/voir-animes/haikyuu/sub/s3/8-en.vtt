WEBVTT

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.150
To borrow Tendou's words for a second...

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.700
I'm starting to get into it!

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.910
There's something wrong with his hand.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.620
But you have to risk something if you want a reward!

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.790
Karasuno is only Karasuno when we're persistently attacking!

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.000
Full-team synchronized attack!

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.010


00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.010


00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.980
All right!

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.020
Damn it!

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.110
See? That's why you've gotta have someone stay back to dig out a block.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.450
Having everyone attack is way too reckless!

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.660
That block was rather effective.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.370
Did that just decide this match?

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.330
We'll...

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.370
We'll do that again next time.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.720
Hinata.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.550
Shiratorizawa!
Always keep the block timing in your head.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.510
Since you're short, that'll be much more important for you.
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.180
Right.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.430
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.980
If you feel like you're going to be even a little late, switch over to a soft block.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.900
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.110
The plate technique, right?

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.070
Push through!

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.660
All right!

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.330
Sorry.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.660
Shake it off!

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.660
They finally stopped him.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.630
How many points in a row did they get with Ushiwaka serving there?

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.420
Five?

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.670
Six.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.710
That's more than a third of what they need to win!

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.130
Hinata's coming back out now, though.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.050
Pull something off again!
Yeah!

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.890
Give us a good serve, Narita!

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.220
Give us a good one!

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.180
Here I go!

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.940
Sorry!

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.860
Tendou!

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.610
Asahi!

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.130
It's not Kageyama setting. I need to wait to jump!

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.840
But I can do first tempo with anyone!

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.550
One blocker!

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.180
All right!

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.180
Go, go, Karasuno!

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.140
We're just two points behind!

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.810
Is your eye okay, Hinata?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.400
Yep!

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.610
Well, that was a weird way to do a receive.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.900
My hands couldn't get up in time, so I thought about receiving it with my face,

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.700
but I didn't want it to hit my nose either.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.410
What?!

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.990
So you turned your face because you could see it coming?

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.460
Well, if I got a nosebleed, I'd have to go back to the bench.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.010
After I heard about Karasuno's first-year duo,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.140
and then when he stole my ball at school,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.180
I had high hopes.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.980
I hoped he was like the other small yet talented players I've met.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.560
But I was wrong.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.780
I couldn't feel the same polished skills or intelligence in him.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.990
But...

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.030
now I understand.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.330
Something about him annoys me.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.290
I haven't once doubted that we would win.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.630
But right now, I distinctly want to...

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.760
hand you a crushing defeat.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.850
Give us a good serve, Kazuhito!
All right, keep it up.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.690
Don't give up!

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.360
Oh, hey, look!

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.110
Kageyama's warming up!

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.910
He's going back in!

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.120
Oohira!

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.120
All right!

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.330
I can taste blood in my mouth.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.540
I wonder if Shouyou's in pain after all.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.510
Though having someone there to dig out a block is reassuring, isn't it?

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.970
Earlier, he stayed back because only Azumane could've realistically spiked it,

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.310
but normally, Karasuno has everyone who can attack go for it.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.230
Their thought process is less about what to do when they get blocked, and more about how to prevent it.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.230
So as soon as they get blocked, they're basically done for.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.990
Though we did get yelled at about staying back to dig out a block quite a bit back in the day.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.120
If I were the coach, I'd do the same thing.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.950
Actually, even as a player, I can't help but hope that someone digs out a blocked ball.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.120
It's scary otherwise.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.340
Yes! Good job, Wakatoshi!

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.460
Goshiki!

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.130
Cut off the cross-court spike...

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.630
and have Daichi in the path of a straight spike!

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.800
Bring it on!

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.800
I'm gonna take my chance with a straight spike!

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.060
Sorry! It went long!

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.390
Suga!

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.230
If we go for what's safe right now, it'll mean we never changed!

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.690
They're going to do it again!

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.110
Aren't they scared it'll fail?

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.820
Full-team synchronized attack!

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.000
Judging by his form, he won't do a backward set.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.040
I haven't seen him do any combo attacks with number ten.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.130
So it'll probably go to the guy with the beard in the back...

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.210
No.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.500
We'll do that again next time.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.800
I know.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.560
It's because I fell into these thought patterns that I'm losing.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.810
"Is there a set coming for me?"

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.850
I'm not going to think about that.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.560
"I'm just going to hit it."

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.530
Boo-yah, boo-yah, boo-yah!

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.900
By going to attack with that in mind, the opposing blockers become confused.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.990
Boo-yah!

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.910
You can tell by looking at them.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.080
I can't believe Sugawara was able to fearlessly charge in like that after being shut down last time!

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.330
I'm sure he's scared, but I guess it's important to have a strong determination to attack to overpower the fear.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.540
Satori!

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.550
Stick your hands up, damn it!

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.510
I don't care if you wind up guessin' wrong!

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.180
I put you in there knowing damn well that might be a possibility!

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.180
Yessir.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.640
Here he comes!

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.150
Are you finally back, Tiredpants?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.360
Watch the back of your head.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.780
Give us a good serve, Kageyama!

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.470
He's able to serve like that right after subbing back in?!

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.130
It's coming back!

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.890
You can score here! Watch out for... Got i—

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:52.600
Got it!

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.430
He's setting it straight away?

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.430
Damn!

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.190
There it is! He hit it straight down!

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.200
I-I didn't really see it, but everything's so fast!

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.610
They're just one point behind!

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.530
Now I really don't know who's going to win!

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.330
That bastard!
Great job, Hinata!

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:21.290
I thought that our usual fast attack would've been enough of a surprise, but this time he came at me on purpose!

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.120
That was awesome!

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.410
Thanks!

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.750
That's really dangerous, you dumbass!

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.710
Go, go!

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.420
Hey! You guys aren't being loud enough!

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.920
You can do it!
Ushijima!

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.470
Now they're into double digits.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.600
Focus on one point at a time!
His serves are intense.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.940
You can't let him get going!

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.650
Hey, why isn't Semi our starting setter?

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.030
He's way better than Shirabu, to be honest.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.150
It all depends on what you consider to be better.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.870
I like Shirabu's reliability myself.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.200
I know what I lack compared to Shirabu.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.370
It's the need to show just how good I am.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:09.550
Even though I know our setter doesn't need that right now, I can't stop it.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.430
But I'm free to go all-out with my serves!

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:28.520
A service ace!

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.570
All right!

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:35.070
Nice serve, Semi!

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.740
Semi!

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.660
I have to find the right words to say to them.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.380
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.750
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.590
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.050
Shiratorizawa!

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.430
Don't stay quiet!

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.850
Shiratorizawa!
This is exactly when we should be cheering!

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.310
Shiratorizawa!
We're going to finish this.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:03.890
Yeah.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.640
Eita, hit another serve like—

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:33.840
Fire it up, fire it up, Karasuno! Get it, get it, Karasuno!

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.540
Go, go, Karasuno!

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:40.800
Below lies the City of Trees, Sendai!

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:50.310
And when you look up, the magnificent Sendai Castle!

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.730
Fire it up, fire it up, Karasuno! Get it, get it, Karasuno!

00:11:50.310 --> 00:12:06.080
Our school, our glorious Shiratorizawa Academy!

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.820
Fire it up...

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:16.090
Our glorious Shiratorizawa Academy!

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.880
Give us an other good serve, Eita!

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.090
Here's our chance to score!

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.930
Wakatoshi!

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.600
That far from the net?!

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.240
All right!

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.820
He stopped it!

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.200
Shouyou!

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.080
N-Nice blo—

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.580
Wait, was that a block?

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:53.920
I told him to do a soft block, but that was more like an insanely close receive.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.760
I'd be too scared of getting whacked in the face to pull that off!

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.300
Now Karasuno's into double digits too!

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:11.980


00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.320
Now Karasuno's in the double digits too!

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.740
Yes! All right! Yeah!

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.290
Don't get so excited about dumb luck!

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.500
That was a block that got in the way of a receive.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:36.210
Ushijima, you must have some work left to do if you got stopped by a nameless first-year.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.460
I guess so.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.930
Ushijima is a great ace that always has people watching him.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.010
It's no surprise that his spikes get stopped sometimes.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.850
But getting blocked by such a tiny first-year is different.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.430
Hinata, you're serving next.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.180
Right!

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.270
He actually had the instinct to jump back at that moment...

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.440
Yeah!

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.990
Narita, go in for a spike whenever you like. I'll sync up with your timing.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.950
R-Right.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.570
Get out there!

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.910
We're counting on you!

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.370
Go, Yamaguchi!

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.870
Don't hold back.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.340
There's not a single thing for you to be scared of.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.930
I'll be aiming to hit it diagonally right at Ushiwaka,

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.180
but there's no point if I don't hit it hard too.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.770
Hayato!

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.270
Damn it!

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.730
We can score here!

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:34.230
Got it!

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.690
Here we go!

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.150
Synchronized attack!

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.190
Come here!

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.360
Come right over here!

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.320
All rig—

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.830
Yes!

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.540
He touched the net?! Talk about lucky!

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.540
I think there's more to it than just luck!

00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.750
If we keep hitting them hard, they're going to start pushing back.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.970
Damn it...

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.430
It's all yours!

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.640
Wakatoshi!

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.560
Wait! Take it slow!

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.350
Ready, and... jump!

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.780
Despite all these barriers we've put up, it's still not enough to stop him?!

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.860
Got it!

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.530
We didn't sync up!

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.660
All right! We tied it up!

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.630
That was a little high. I'll correct it for next time.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.630
No, uh... Sure.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.300
This is your first time working together, yet you went for a fast attack?!

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.010
Do it again, Yamaguchi!

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:58.770
Did I hit it too far?

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.940
Let it go!

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.900
All right!
Sorry I didn't decide fast enough.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.400
No, uh... Damn it!

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.660
Yamaguchi!

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.700
Nice serve, Yamaguchi!

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.370
Thanks!
Timeout!

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.740
What's the matter, Goshiki?

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.080
Why would you have any reason to panic with all of your talent?

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.790
Shiratorizawa!

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.580
Shiratorizawa!

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.130
Shiratorizawa!

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.840
Shiratorizawa!

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.380
You're right.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.760
We'll stop it next time.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.260
He doesn't dress up his words, nor are they ambiguous.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.640
Right!

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
There's no encouragement—only the truth.
Shiratorizawa!

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.600
What other words are needed from one great ace to another?

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.100
They turned it around!

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.940
That's three points in a row!

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.820
Holy crap!

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.320
They might just win this thing!

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.280
Win!

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.110
Win this, Karasuno!

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.410
All right!

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.830
That's perfect, Oohira.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.550
All right!

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.180
Whoa. That angle was brutal.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.840
They got that over the incomplete block perfectly!

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.840
Goshiki!

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.810
Goshiki!

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.440
I'm sure he wanted to make up for his last serve receive.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.650
Great job, Yamaguchi.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:24.940
Leave the rest to me!

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.900
But you're going to be switching out soon with Nishinoya.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.660
Tsutomu, keep calm!

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.570
I know!

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.790
Let's do this!

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.750
Bring it!

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.510
Damn it all!

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.590
Isn't number eight supposed to be the impulsive type?!

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.850
Tsutomu is the only first-year in our starting lineup.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:57.810
Don't underestimate him.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.770
Noya!

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.400
All right!

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.150
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.240
They've got Karasuno on the ropes.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.610
Ushijima!
Four-eyes isn't here, either.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.070
I wonder how they're gonna survive this match point.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:33.050
One more point! One more point!

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.920
Nice receive!

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.550
Synchronized attack!

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.100
All right!

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.970
You actually made the guy who just received the ball spike it?

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.980
It's a deuce.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:47.360
They should be running out of stamina by now, yet they're all still able to run around like that.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.480
Toying with us using their strength in numbers...

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.200
I have no choice but to admit that it's an effective method of attack.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.660
Coach!

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:02.660
I won't lose to anyone when it comes to receiving, and I can jump really high, so I'm confident in my attacks!

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.620
Right.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.580
Now you just have to get a bit taller.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.340
I'm so small that I can't even fight?

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.880
I'm going to lose to someone just because they're tall?

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.090
One more!

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.470
One more, please!

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.980
No one here is "just" tall.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.100
I understand that.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.190
I envy them, and they annoy me,

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.280
yet I admire them greatly.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.120
Do I want a way to fight in spite of my short stature?

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.410
No, I...

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.670
If they can't score twice in a row, Karasuno's going to keep being in danger.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.750
Their stamina and concentration could run out at any moment.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:58.050
Just get the ball from Shiratorizawa's powerful cannon up any way you can.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.010
Give us a good serve, Daichi!

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.060
It's not gonna make it!

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.690
There's gotta be a limit on aiming for the net!

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:11.610
Goshiki!
Right!

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.410
Keep the rally going!

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.410
The last hit is all yours, Kageyama!

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.410
This is our chance! Spike it again!

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.670
They made our setter receive it.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.380
Ushijima!

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.790
Don't panic.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.050
If we mess up the timing, it's all over.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.170
Ready, and... jump!

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:41.180
Do I want a way to fight in spite of my short stature?

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.390
No, I...

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.390
want a simple strength that can bend anything to my will.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.860
Whoa! They're not giving up!

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.110
Damn it! It's taking all they have just to get the ball back over the net!

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.700
A rally where both sides are low on stamina and are fighting for momentum...

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.870
Don't let your energy run out, and don't stop hitting the ball.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.290
It hasn't hit the ground yet!

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.250
Get it!
This point!

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.460
We have to get it, no matter what!

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.130
Shut up! We're the better team!

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.060
All right!

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:32.020
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.980
Ushijima!

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:53.880
One more point! One more point!

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.790
This is bad. They're all gloomy now.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.580
But we don't have any more timeo—

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:56.130
Don't you dare look down!

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.010
Volleyball...

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.840
is a sport where you're always looking up!

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.060
Hitoka!

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:26.990


00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.000


00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.290
A-Are you okay?

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.960
I'm not used to taking stairs two at a time...

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.880
All right!

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.970
Now that Yacchan's back, it's finally time for the counterattack!

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.840
Next time on Haikyuu!!:

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.220
"The Volleyball Freaks."

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.200
Got a wish that can't be forced through

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.080
Barely hanging on and staying true

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.040
With a little help from timing and your crew

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.790
You can still stay standing

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.800
Wanna take the fight head-on

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.550
Might get lost, but keep on keeping on

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:46.140
'Cause that's where your chance lies

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.520
The rest is up to you, yes

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.190
The rest is up to you

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.570
Make your dreams and ideals come true

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.360
Or sit tight and let the future pass on through

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.490
The rest is up to you

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.700
You ain't the luckiest of guys

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.120
And you ain't anywhere near wise

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.040
The winds of change are too bright for your eyes

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.370
But you wanna have all the luck

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.960
Stuff all the wisdom junk in your trunk

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:24.840
And live holding your head up high

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.180
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:36.190
It's all up to you People might call you naive

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.980
And say you're not doing it right

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.860
But the rest is up to you

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.110
Don't lose your way, and push on anew

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.740
It's all up to you

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.350
Light a fire in every cell of your body

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.680
By taking a deep, long breath

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.440
Turn your blood and tears into offerings

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.150
Carry a torch fueled by your desires

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:53.370
And scream out at full volume Let there be light

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.410
With a prayer for the future, start your sprint

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.670
Let there be light, use the dark as your runway

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.300
And sprint through the path you chose

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.680
Let there be light, believe in the glory within your grasp

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.770
And run headlong into the despair in front of you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.940
Let there be light
There is only one reason I kick the ground

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.110
Let there be light

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.200
It is so I shine brighter and soar higher than before

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.200
Let there be light, so that your brilliance of today

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:45.000
Shows your friends who are lost The way to the future

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.720
To those who bear the cross of their dreams

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.010
The warriors who seek eternal glory Let there be light
