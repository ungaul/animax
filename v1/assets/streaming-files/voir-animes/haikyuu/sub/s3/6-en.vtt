WEBVTT

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.990
All right, first-years, introduce yourselves.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.900
Yes, sir!

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.240
I-I'm Sugawara Koushi from Nagamushi Junior High!

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.120
I played setter!

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.660
Thank you for having me!

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.710
I-I'm Azumane Asahi from Seikoudai Junior High!

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.540
I played left wing spiker! Thank you for hafing mwe!

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.420
I bit my tongue!

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.720
I'm Sawamura Daichi from Izumitate Junior High!

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.100
I played left wing spiker!

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.350
After seeing Karasuno's match at nationals, I decided I would come here!

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.930
Thank you for having me!

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.940
Oh, I see. That's great.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.650
Let's aim to win at nationals!

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.440
Yes, sir!

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.190
Oh, I'm Tashiro.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.280
I guess you could call me the captain of this team.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.660
All right. I'll stop by again once you guys are done.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.530
Yes, sir!

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.870
All right, let's start practice!

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.080
Okay!

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.500
Um... That teacher was the advisor, right?

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.420
Do we have a coach or anyone else like that?

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.250
Nope.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.680
That was Kurokawa from Hisa Junior High, right?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.930
Do you know him?

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.220
Our schools played each other.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.310
I remember him being really good at both offense and defense.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.980
Seriously? That's awesome.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.810
We finally made it to the Karasuno!

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.980


00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.030


00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.580
Hey, Kurokawa.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.960
Tell me the secret behind receiving serves.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.170
I'm the type that goes right for the ball once the other team hits it.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.470
I see...

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.350
Clean up!

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.140
Okay!

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.270
Hey, even though there's a tournament coming up, we haven't had many practice matches, have we?

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.270
They were saying that ever since Coach Ukai left, we've lost connections with other schools.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.410
Even the school we've been doing practice matches with until recently turned us down.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.740
What? Why?

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.160
They don't see any value in wasting their time with us.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.120
I knew that Karasuno wasn't the same team as before.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.800
But I thought that if we kept practicing, we could get people excited again.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.220
It wasn't like the team was fighting each other, or that we were in some sort of hopeless situation.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.430
Yet...

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.190
there was this fear that we were slowly losing our way.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.030
Um!

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.740
Could I stay behind and practice a little more?!

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.040
I'll make sure to lock up!

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.950
M-Me too!

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.830
Me three!

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.710
We'll let the advisor know too!

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.340
Sure.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.090
We can't go on like this!

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.300
It may seem like there's time, but there isn't!

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.050
You totally sound like a teacher!

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.050
Are you really the same age as us, Sawamura?

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.140
Even if we only pick up loose balls, there are still things we can do!

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.400
Figure out where he's going to hit it from his form!

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.320
Hey! Why did you catch that?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.700
I-I'm sorry!

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.370
We'll think and act on our own.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.090
We'll do everything that we possibly can right now.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.050
Starting tomorrow, we have the interhigh prelims.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.300
Let's do our best so that we don't have any regrets.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.130
Right!

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.350
Let's aim to win at nationals!

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.440
Hey, I've been thinking this for a while, but why don't we aim for something more attainable?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.480
What?

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.530
They say that aiming for goals that are too high is connected to losing confidence.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.400
Wh-What the hell?

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.240
Every time I would mention winning at nationals, you would just scoff and ignore me.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.200
Now you want to argue with me?!

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200
What the hell?!

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.120
Why the hell does this make me happy, damn it?!

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.710
Huh?! Why would I know?!

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.510
I don't feel like we're working toward a common goal yet, but we have a better vibe than before!

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.220
And we all share the desire to win the upcoming match!

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.680
We're gonna win this thing!

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.470
Yeah!

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.690
And so, in the Miyagi qualifiers for the interhigh...

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.070
Karasuno lost in the second round,

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.400
and the third-years retired.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.990
The crows have had their wings clipped.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.460
We started working together way too late.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:44.680
You know how they say, "Chance favors only the prepared mind," right?

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.010
There's a chance that Karasuno may never get better.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.680
And even if they do, it could be years from now.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.860
Still, if the chance appears, you'd better grab it!

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.070
Now.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.740
We have to go now.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.320
This is that chance!

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.790
They clearly didn't prepare for Hinata's block, so that's definitely shaking them up.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.050
That itself is a subtle crack in their armor,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.960
and the wind's definitely blowing in our favor right now.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.550
Here's a chance to score!

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.510
Damn it!

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.850
Don't give up the tiny lead you've fought so hard for!

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.350
Goshiki!

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.310
Damn it! I started moving a second late!

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.610
There's no way they can just ignore Hinata's style of blocking where he suddenly pops up!

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.990
It's definitely going to be a straight spike!

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.240
Leave it to me!

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.950
All right!

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.500
Nice spike, Asahi!

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.790
Couldn't let Hinata and Tanaka take all the glory.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.790
Kageyama, you made a great receive too.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.920
Thanks.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.520
His serve is powerful!

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.730
We have to stop him here!

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.770
Right!

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.570
Nishinoya!

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.690
Sorry! It went long!

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.280
Hold it, Tsutomu!

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.200
Karasuno's setter is in the back row right now.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.870
He can't do a setter dump. Watch carefully...

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.830
He's already there!

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.290
All right!

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.170
Damn it!

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.920
They're still as sharp as ever even this far into the match.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.510
They must be stamina monsters.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.920
Man.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.890
That move's gotta be hard to repeat, no much how much they practiced it.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.890
Shiratorizawa!

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.430
We're counting on you!

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.310
Shiratorizawa!

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.560
Number ten finally moved to the back row.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.890
Shiratorizawa!

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.310
Tsukki! Don't lose to Hinata!

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.230
Shiratorizawa!
What?!

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.730
Shiratorizawa!

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.780
It's not like we're competing.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.030
Shiratorizawa!

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.700
Shiratorizawa!
Hey.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.700
Huh?

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.740
We're counting on you!

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.410
Shiratorizawa!
Right!

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.620
I can do my part, but can you?
Shiratorizawa!

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.500
Well, I practiced with Akaashi, so...

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.960
He's practicing with Fukurodani's setter?!

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.840
I'm super jealous!

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.180
Hinata!

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.890
Shiratorizawa!
Sit down.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.970
The rest of this match is going to be a test of stamina. Rest while you can!

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.760
Shiratorizawa!
Yes, sir.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.230
I don't want to lose to Hinata either.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.440
This time, I'm definitely going to create my own chance!

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.730
Give us a good serve, Yamaguchi!

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.320
Huh?

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.320
Looks like he's going to hit really close to the edge this time.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.070
Your serve will become a weapon.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.910
Just concentrate on hitting it straight.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.830
Right to where Ushiwaka is!

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.000
Yes! We broke through!

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.710
And... Goshiki!

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.540
Right!
Ushiwaka will have to set!

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.130
Three blockers!

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.970
Don't underestimate me.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.590
I'm going to break through!

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:15.930
I hit it!

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.140
Get back here!

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.350
Nice save!

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.560
A one-man delayed timing attack.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.160
You're not the only one

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.370
who was preparing a new move at the training camp, Hinata.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.080
All right!

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.330
Karasuno scored back-to-back points!

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.840
That first-year is pretty ballsy.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.300
Damn it, Tsukishima! Damn it... Nice spike, Tsukki!

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.510
Yer lowerin' your elbows!

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.020
You'll even miss the easy stuff like that!

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.480
You've got those huge bodies of yours!

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.060
So you need to be more, like... Dynamic?

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.230
Yeah, that!

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.070
Shiratorizawa!

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.110
It's true that Karasuno's defense has been evolving during this match,

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.280
Shiratorizawa!

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.740
even if it's just a stopgap.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.450
Shiratorizawa!
But...

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.910
There is no such thing as a defense without holes.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.240
Shiratorizawa!

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.170
Do it again, Yamaguchi!

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.350
It's over! Up front!

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.100
Got it!

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.230
Damn it.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.110
Ushiwaka's spikes aren't easing up.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.280
But since he's spiked so many times, he must be feeling it in his legs by now.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.450
Yeah.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.830
If he keeps going like this, he'll eventually reach the end of his reserves.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.420
Go, Asahi!

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.630
Got it!

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.840
Their timing was off!

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.900
Wow, talk about lucky!

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.150
My heart tightened like crazy!

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.610
But it all worked out in the end!

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.240
They're at set point!

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:43.080
It's their first best-of-five match, and their opponents are regulars at nationals.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.790
From the fourth set onward is unexplored territory for Karasuno.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.630
He's able to complete the ridiculous attacks number ten starts,

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.630
and he's been doing it the whole time like it's nothing.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.680
Precision is probably expected of him more than anyone else.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.100
And since he faces more pressure from the opponent's blockers than anyone else,

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.310
he touches the ball more than anyone else playing.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.190
Looks like that guy might've reached his limit first.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.110
Sorry.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.190
It's creepy when you apologize, so could you not?

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.110
What?!

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.320
See? You're fine.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.490
Give us a good serve, Daichi!

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.160
Up front!

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.460
Ushijima!

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.670
All right!
Damn it.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.720
Could that be their second pinch server?

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.180
Since it's Shiratorizawa, I'm sure they've got a deep bench.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.560
Please just don't bring this to a deuce.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.810
Let's go!

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.190
A jump float serve!

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.990
Sorry!

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.110
Azumane!

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.910
He dug it out!

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.990
Watch Ushiwaka!

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.700
Wakatoshi!

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.080
Here we go.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.830
Ready, and... jump!

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.170
Shit!

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.720
When you defend a part of the court,

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.220
you have to sacrifice another part of the court.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.310
If you brace for a powerful hit and move back,

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.980
then the front will be open.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.980
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:39.980
Ushijima!

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.940
Ushijima!

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.200
They were totally aiming for the open space...

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.990
Shiratorizawa!

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.160
I thought Kageyama would still be able to get that.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.160
Shiratorizawa!

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.040
He must be exhausted.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.200
Shiratorizawa!

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.330
Is the exhausted little setter gonna have to face the deuce of despair?

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.330
Shiratorizawa!

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.170
Shiratorizawa!

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.880
The only time I'll ever feel despair...

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.880
is when I won't be able to play volleyball anymore.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.880
Shiratorizawa!

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.600
Shiratorizawa!

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:12.100
All of you guys are monsters.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.100
Shiratorizawa!

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:20.980


00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.080
All right, here we go!

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.950
The positioning of the defense is fine as-is.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.500
You're able to follow up on partial blocks.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.210
Yes, sir!

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.670
Can you keep going, Kageyama?

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.250
Of course.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.630
If you get worn out, I can switch with you whenever!

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.050
I won't wear out!

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.640
Daichi!

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.310
It's not dropping.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:01.860
All right!
Yes!

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.940
Now they're at set point again.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.200
It's a deuce again.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.080
It's fine! They'll be able to...

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.330
Ugh!

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.540
Talk about bad timing.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.250
Bring it!

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:41.610
Wakatoshi, the miracle boy!

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.190
I can't believe that just happened.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.360
Now Shiratorizawa is at match point.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.740
If they score again, it's all over.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:17:01.080
One more point! One more point!

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.200
You can do it... You can do it!

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.310
Nishinoya!

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.700
Damn demon serve!

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.200
Here's our chance!

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.070
Crap!

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.370
Goddammit!

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.800
Yes!
They stopped it!

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.260
They survived the match point!

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.640
That's amazing!

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.640
Hey, could you not just run into me?

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.890
It's not like you're Hinata.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.230
Jump up. Up.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.190
What?!

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.150
There's no way that'd count as bumping into you!

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.020
You just don't have the training to take it!

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.980
You two!

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.240
Seriously, give me a break!

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.360
I can feel my lifespan shortening!

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.950
Hmph. This ain't nothing.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.910
Says the guy who was panicking when Shiratorizawa had a chance to score.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.420
It ain't nothing.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:31.920
This is nothing compared to when they stopped being a powerhouse school and didn't gather any attention.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.640
I'm expecting great things from you, Karasuno!

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.350
Whoa, what?

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:44.730
Who's that?

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.560
N-No idea...

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.490
That old fart's still coming to our matches?

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.910
I guess we can't let him down, then.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.450
Get out there!

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:02.160
For me, the most annoying person isn't an opposing blocker.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.660
It's him.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.920
All right!

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.000
We're going to win!

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:23.230
Go, go, Karasuno! Push it, push it, Karasuno!

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.430
Hey, Tiredpants.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.890
No matter how shitty your sets are, I can hit them!

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.270
My sets are never shitty.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.190
Roger!

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.030
If Sugawara is coming in as a pinch server right now,

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.740
that means Kageyama is going to be the setter for the rest of this set.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.080
Well, nothing good would come of suddenly switching them right now.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.160
Land a good serve, Suga!

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.210
Reon! Up front!

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.630
Nice receive!

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.300
Your beautiful form... is falling apart!

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.180
It's out!

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.560
Yes!

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:14.320
I think it'd be okay to rely on the left wing spiker a bit more, but Kageyama sure is confident.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.360
It's a silent plea.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:22.240
No matter how tired he is or how tense things get, he doesn't plan on letting up with the attacks.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.540
He wants the opposing middle blocker to have to keep his guard up.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.170
Bring it!

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.800
That was good!

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.890
Up front!

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.140
Here's our chance to score!

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.350
It's short!

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.360
Volleyball is a sport where you can't hold the ball.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.820
You need to always be touching it.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.700
I don't care if you use your hand or foot.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.240
You need to control that moment as though the ball

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.500
were a part of your body.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.210
His body's moving right, yet he used his left hand.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.520
All right!

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.980
They're turning misfortune into fortune, or something like that.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:35.770
D'ya have glue on your feet or somethin', idjits?

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.730
You could've gotten that ball!

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.900
Wow... They finally tied it up!

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.620
Seriously?

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.580
Nice one, Hinata!

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.830
That was a good reaction!

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.370
Thanks!

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.290
This is our best opportunity.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.330
If the chance appears,

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.670
you'd better grab it!

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.340
We can do this.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.300
Let's go!

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.020
Nice save.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.900
If you think it's nice, at least say it with a nice face!

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.690
More importantly, Kageyama.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.700
We get to play another set!

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.950
Yeah.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:27.030


00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:57.040


00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:03.090
When we were first-years, for about six months, I called you "Hafing Mwe" in my head, Asahi.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.590
You even sorta looked like a foreigner.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.260
Actually, you called me that quite a few times out loud too.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.510
Next time on Haikyuu!!:

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.350
"Obsession."

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.250
Got a wish that can't be forced through

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.120
Barely hanging on and staying true

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.080
With a little help from timing and your crew

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.840
You can still stay standing

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.840
Wanna take the fight head-on

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.590
Might get lost, but keep on keeping on

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.180
'Cause that's where your chance lies

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.560
The rest is up to you, yes

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.230
The rest is up to you

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.610
Make your dreams and ideals come true

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.360
Or sit tight and let the future pass on through

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.530
The rest is up to you

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.740
You ain't the luckiest of guys

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.160
And you ain't anywhere near wise

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.080
The winds of change are too bright for your eyes

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.420
But you wanna have all the luck

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.960
Stuff all the wisdom junk in your trunk

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.880
And live holding your head up high

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.220
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:36.230
It's all up to you People might call you naive

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.020
And say you're not doing it right

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.900
But the rest is up to you

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.150
Don't lose your way, and push on anew

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.790
It's all up to you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.320
Light a fire in every cell of your body

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.660
By taking a deep, long breath

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.410
Turn your blood and tears into offerings

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.120
Carry a torch fueled by your desires

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:51.340
And scream out at full volume Let there be light

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.390
With a prayer for the future, start your sprint

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.640
Let there be light, use the dark as your runway

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.270
And sprint through the path you chose

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.650
Let there be light, believe in the glory within your grasp

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.740
And run headlong into the despair in front of you

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.910
Let there be light
There is only one reason I kick the ground

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.090
Let there be light

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.170
It is so I shine brighter and soar higher than before

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.180
Let there be light, so that your brilliance of today

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:43.020
Shows your friends who are lost The way to the future

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.690
To those who bear the cross of their dreams

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.030
The warriors who seek eternal glory Let there be light
