WEBVTT

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.860
Of course not.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.490
But...

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.570
I plan on stopping at least a few of his spikes.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.460
All right!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.000


00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.010


00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.970
Shiratorizawa!

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.270
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.690
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.310
He purposely cleared a path for the ball to go through.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.610
He made Wakatoshi think he could get it through,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.650
and then he blocked it.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.360
Shiratorizawa!
That damn glasses-wearing brat...

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.740
Shiratorizawa!
But still, we lost that set.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.620
I'm more scared by the fact that Tanji hasn't yelled at us yet.
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.120
Kenjirou.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.000
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.300
Yes?

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.380
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.510
Your expression tells me that you already know.
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.260
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.560
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.770
You alive, Kenjirou?

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.940
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.270
If this was a practice match, I would've gotten a slap across the face.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.650
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.650
Really?

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.110
I wouldn't say that set was bad enough to qualify as a mistake.
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.780
That sorta thing happens all the time.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.240
Shiratorizawa!

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.360
This wasn't some simple mistake.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.620
Shiratorizawa!

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.430
Give us a good serve, Daichi!

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.890
Cover it!

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.690
Shake it off! Keep being aggressive!

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.520
Right!

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.280
It doesn't seem like Shiratorizawa's going to crumble at all.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.070
Yeah.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.620
All right!

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.830
Their setter...

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.080
Not only is he not letting the second set get to him, but it seems like his eyes are more focused than ever.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.670
That attack made me dizzy.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.010
And I look up to setters who play elegantly.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.800
But...

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.140
All right!

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.270
Shirabu, your sets are as sharp as ever today.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.060
Thanks.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.770
Our team was pretty good,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.030
but up until the generation before us, it was often these two schools fighting to take another step forward.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.740
Kitagawa First were lacking in their physique,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.330
but they used speed and combo attacks to their advantage, and they looked elegant.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.670
To a setter like me, Oikawa definitely seemed like a monster,

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.880
and yet I thought

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.630
that the height and power which could stop skilled teamwork

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.760
or attacks with multiple people

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.230
was the coolest thing of all.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.310
I want to be able to fight like that.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.560
Where, if all else fails, we can win with just a really high set.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.650
A kind of volleyball where the setter doesn't need to control everything.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.360
I'm going to Shiratorizawa.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.620
Huh?

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.330
I'm going to go where other good players are and play some good volleyball.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.880
For me, the coolest way to play volleyball

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.840
is this.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.980
I'll become the setter that stands out the least.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.020
All right!

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.780
Damn it... Shiratorizawa!

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.240
We'll win the next one!

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.570
Shiratorizawa!
Are you all right, Nishinoya?

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.160
Shiratorizawa!

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.120
There's no getting around the fact that the bigger you are, the greater your advantage is in volleyball.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.330
Shiratorizawa!

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.410
Shiratorizawa!

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.580
And right now, there's no one bigger than him.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.920
Just one more set!

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.580
Shiratorizawa!

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.300
But none of that matters to a libero.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.590
Shiratorizawa!

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.970
I'm his only equal on the court.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.560
All right, here we go!

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.560
Karasuno High School!

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.190
Since you were able to move like that,

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.280
I figured you must be good at receiving and blocking too.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.910
You can't compete in terms of height, so what chance do you have if your technique is clumsy too?

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.500
"Clumsy: lacking dexterity, nimbleness, or grace. Awkward or inefficient in use." Got it?

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.920
Got it!

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.130
Hey, stop dawdling!
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.890
You remind me of Ushiwaka somehow.
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.520
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.310
Really?

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.060
Well, I do wish I could spike like he does.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.980
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.360
Shiratorizawa!
That's not what I meant.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.820
Shiratorizawa!

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.240
Shiratorizawa!
All right, have a seat. Rest while you can.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.740
Shiratorizawa!

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.830
I'm sure you're finally getting used to both the finals and Shiratorizawa's cannon.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.830
Shiratorizawa!

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.210
How you're playing is fine on a technical level.
Shiratorizawa!

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.250
Don't get confused.
Shiratorizawa!

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.010
I know you're probably tired, but remember to always keep your blocks together.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.510
If your blocks are all over the place, they won't just be ineffective,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.550
but you'll get in the way of the receiver too.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.350
On both offense and defense, use numbers to your advantage.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.770
Don't forget that!

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.690
Yes, sir!

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.980
Azumane.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.860
Give us a good serve, Tsutomu!

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.570
I'm on a roll right now.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.910
I'm gonna land this in one try!

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.040
Out!

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.420
Home run!

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.380
That was lucky!

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:06.800
Reon!

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.140
Nice receive!

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.390
This is clearly a setup for Ushiwaka.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.480
He's going to smash down it from above, blow through our blocks,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.060
or, if we're lucky, we'll deflect it.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.770
Or...

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.690
If Ushiwaka comes in fast from the right and attacks,

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.150
if you and I both go to block, let's tighten up on the cross-court spike...

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.280
a little more than usual.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.950
We won't be able to cut him off as much as a three-person block could,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.620
but while we're closing off the cross-court spike...

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.420
the guardian angel's field of view becomes clearer.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.390
The only one on the court who is Ushiwaka's equal...

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.140
...is me.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.770
I can't let us keep losing!
Yes!

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.150
Nice receive!

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.780
All right!

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.110
Yeah!

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.240
Tsutomu!

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.450
If you keep standin' in dumb-ass places, you won't be able to dig out a spike or give backup!

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.200
Yes, sir!

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.370
Coach is calmer than usual today, but he's not holding back on me at all.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Why do you think you get yelled at the most?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.340
Because I lack discipline!

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.590
It's because he's counting on you the most.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.420
Huh?

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.140
All right, bring it!

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.100
He's way too simple-minded.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.400
What I said is true, though.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.190
All right!

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.400
You're too slow.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.160
Blocking is all about intuition and sense of smell.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.490
Blocking is systematic.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:03.960
Hinata!

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920
Goshiki!

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.800
It's the guy who does the really sharp straight spikes, so we'll tighten up for that!

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.760
Yes! Hinata made it!

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.640
He hit to the outside?!

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.230
All right!
He hit it through that gap?!

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.310
That was all luck, wasn't it?

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.440
Luck?

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.310
Don't be absurd.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.320
You're only an ace if you're able to create miracles!

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.490
Stop trying to sound cool!

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:35.740
Okay.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.490
That spike was amazing.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.700
But that just means...

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.910
we have to score in a different, even cooler way!

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.910
Yeah!

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.580
Nice receive!

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.130
All right!

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.840
Use numbers to your advantage!

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.550
Go for the synchronized attack!

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.260
Oh, here comes that annoying attack again.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.390
However...

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.740
The synchronized attack was blocked.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.000


00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.640
Nice block, Kawanishi!

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.680
Kawanishi! Kawanishi!

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.520
Number twelve saw that Sawamura didn't get back in position in time,

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.070
so he instantly discarded the possibility of an attack from the right side.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:12:00.620
The chance Sawamura would spike wasn't completely zero, but the chance of them trying to force it was low.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.200
If only you'd thought about all that back in the day.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.500
Hello!

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.970
You guys always seemed to go for the ball without giving it any thought.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.180
W-We were doing what we could!

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.430
Like focusing on spiking it hard or landing a serve!

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.760
It's their scary former coach.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.470
He's Ukai's grandpa.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.020
There we go.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.230
Looks like Coach Washijou's got a pretty good lineup as always.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.320
If all of them didn't go in for the attack,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.830
one of them might've been able to dig out the block.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.080
Right.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.790
The strategies of our two teams

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:54.040
are completely different, but we both are alike in that we like to score points by force.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.880
All right!

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.720
This is a battle between two different concepts.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.810
It's always been like that with Ukai.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:13.770
This is the perfect opportunity to see which of our groups of high school students is currently better.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.980
Give us a good one, Daichi!

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.660
If Ushiwaka isn't going to receive serves,

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.490
we just have to hit it to their left side.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.120
Reon!

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.620
Nice receive!
And then have Ushiwaka

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.710
spike as much as possible!

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.000
Let's stop him!

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.550
I've seen Tsukishima look annoyed before, but seeing him look frustrated is pretty new.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.550
All right!

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.600
Yes! The receive is off!

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.270
Here we go.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.150
Ready, and... jump!

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:11.790
If Ushiwaka gets a perfect set and blasts through your block, there's nothing you can do.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.710
We have to focus on doing something about the rest.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.420
Assuming we're able to stick two or more blockers on Ushiwaka,

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.050
whoever's in the middle in the back row will take a step back.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.470
That's what Ennoshita did in the Waku South match!

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.510
Exactly!

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:32.390
Since our blocks with Tsukishima as the focus are doing better than expected, we should definitely give this a try.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:34.940
It's only a single step.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.360
But it's an important one.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.450
Don't let it end with Hinata or Tanaka digging it out with their fast reflexes.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.950
You have to get one that's not a miracle.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:49.700
Daichi!
Got it!

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.000
The last hit's all yours, Tanaka!

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.620
Get back!

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.580
Nope!

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:01.840
What?!

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.670
He stopped it!

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.850
The miracle boy, Satori!

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.230
Satori!

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.440
Damn it!

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.150
He was seriously able to stop that spike without knowing where it was coming from?

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.740
Good job stopping that.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.660
The way he was facing, he couldn't afford to see where the block was.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.540
And spikers frequently end up looking at the spot where they plan to spike it.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.920
So that's how he was able to determine where the ball would go.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:47.630
Which means that number five was going to hit it to the same spot, regardless of where he was standing.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.760
I'm sorry!

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.630
Shake it off!

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.180
That block was pretty amazing.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.640
Yes, it was!

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.390
I think they're fine.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.770
If they're able to do that high-level stuff like it's nothing, they'll be fine.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:04.740
But their opponents are called champions because it's going to take more than that to win.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.700
Give us a good serve, Wakatoshi!

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.040
Sorry!

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.500
What?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.960
Is he Mr. Perfect?

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.010
Is Ushiwaka Mr. Friggin' Perfect?!

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.260
Do it again!

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.430
Someone get it!

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.560
I'm not gonna let them extend their lead!

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.270
The block's low!

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.610
All right!

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.190
Right!

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.950
Hey.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.450
If you don't score any points when you're in the front row, nothing's gonna start.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.410
Got it!

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.130
Come to think of it, didn't Ushiwaka say something to Hinata in between sets?

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.630
Oh, yes.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.170
"A shrimp who sucks as much as you do has no right to live,"

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.510
apparently.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.840
Seriously? Are you sure his persecution complex wasn't getting to him?

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.890
That's what I thought too, but apparently that's what Ushiwaka meant.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.770
I wonder how Hinata's gonna respond.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.980
Should you be laughing at that?

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.310
Well, I mean,

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.280
if that was enough to break his heart, he wouldn't be here right now.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:36.910
That gap! It's a good spot!

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.500
Sorry! It's short!

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.330
Oohira!

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:48.130
You can't compete in terms of height, so what chance do you have if your technique is clumsy too?

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.800
Damn it!

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.260
I'm jealous that he's so tall!

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.010
I'm jealous, but...

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.430
It's a block, but it's almost like...

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.770
he's doing a running approach for a spike!

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.610
The running approach gives you man-made wings.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.370
He blocked it!

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.710
I'm jealous, but...

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.540
I never said that I wasn't going to fight with height!

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.420
Karasuno scored twice in a row!

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.130
Hey, now!

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:35.470
That little number ten finally did a decent block!

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:40.180
Yeah, but he's pretty erratic, so it might've just been luck.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.350
Why are they talking like they know each other?

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:51.230
But if that wasn't a fluke, this match is going to change.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.070
Nishinoya.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.530
I've fallen for Shouyou all over again!

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.280
He should just do that every time!

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.700
No, no, no.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.210
A running approach like that won't be able to handle fast attacks.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.710
Not to mention, it'll wear down his stamina.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.050
Middle blockers run around everywhere as it is,

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.670
and Hinata's doing more than most.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.220
You always were trying to figure out how you could be as lazy as possible.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.140
You got that right!

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.890
I have no complaints if you actually succeed at being lazy.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:28.110
Oohira!

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.770
One more time!

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.280
Of course!

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.410
I'm so sorry!

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.370
Shake it off.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.530
Think about how fast you're going, you moron!

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.660
Shouyou, I have a message from Mr. Ukai.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:49.080
Ideally you'd want to jump straight up, but for now, he said you can jump sideways too.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.340
In return... We'll support both sides.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.210
Yeah.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.140
If my timing's too slow, then there's no point to this!

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.970
Just spike it back!

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.600
I have no complaints if you actually succeed at being lazy.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.980
But in Munchkin's case...

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.730
his only choice is to jump.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.160
Yes!

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.200
Nice spike, Hinata!

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.870
Oh, so you came too.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.580
You said that you weren't going to come because it'd piss you off regardless of who won.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.420
No matter who wins, I'm gonna be able to see the other team's faces when they lose.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.010
You really are a piece of shit.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.510
I don't have time to sit around feeling sorry for myself.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.100
Seems like number ten is as active as always.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.180
He's definitely some kind of monster.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:53.110
But I feel worse for everyone who has to play with him.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:57.940
Sorry!
Tanaka!

00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.570
Right!

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.450
All right!

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.830
Give us a good serve, Tsukishima!

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.000
Highest point of the jump! Highest point of the jump!

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.050
Highest point... of the jump!

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.470
Up front!

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.380
Left!

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:23.930
I touched it!

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:25.390
We can score here!

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.020
Wakatoshi!

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.480
Come on, Hinata.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.190
I'll...

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.940
support you!

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.200
I hit it!

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.280
Got it!

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.370
Don't you dare get worn out!

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.990
Shut up!

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.450
He's going to the other side from there?

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:50.870
Damn it.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.710
All right!

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.180
Tanaka! Great job supporting him!

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.680
It's a senior's job to always be there and help

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.800
his precious juniors!

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.890
A haiku!

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.060
Karasuno scored twice in a row!

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.020
Nice contact, Hinata!

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.980
Even after that reckless synchronized attack, Karasuno sure likes to do some risky things.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.780
New, tricky skills and combo attacks, huh?

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:21.700
In that case...

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.950
let's stomp those out with the individual strengths that we've honed for so long.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.830
Each individual's physical ability, height, and power...

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.380
If that was the way to prove a team's strength, this match would be much simpler.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:42.010
But that not being the case is what makes this so deep and so interesting!

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:42.010


00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:11.970


00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:13.810
Tch.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.970
Tch.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.060
Tch.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.400
You're clicking your tongue a lot more than usual, Tsukishima.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.190
You sound like a clock.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.230
A clock? What does tongue clicking have to do with clocks?

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.650
Hey, concentrate on the match.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.190
Next time on Haikyuu!!:

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.360
"The Chemical Change of Encounters."

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.220
Got a wish that can't be forced through

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.100
Barely hanging on and staying true

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.060
With a little help from timing and your crew

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.810
You can still stay standing

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.810
Wanna take the fight head-on

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.560
Might get lost, but keep on keeping on

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.150
'Cause that's where your chance lies

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.530
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.160
The rest is up to you

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.580
Make your dreams and ideals come true

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.330
Or sit tight and let the future pass on through

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.500
The rest is up to you

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.710
You ain't the luckiest of guys

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.130
And you ain't anywhere near wise

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:29.050
The winds of change are too bright for your eyes

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.390
But you wanna have all the luck

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.930
Stuff all the wisdom junk in your trunk

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:39.860
And live holding your head up high

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.190
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:51.200
It's all up to you People might call you naive

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.000
And say you're not doing it right

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.870
But the rest is up to you

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.130
Don't lose your way, and push on anew

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.760
It's all up to you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.340
Light a fire in every cell of your body

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.680
By taking a deep, long breath

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.430
Turn your blood and tears into offerings

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.140
Carry a torch fueled by your desires

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:49.360
And scream out at full volume Let there be light

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.410
With a prayer for the future, start your sprint

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.660
Let there be light, use the dark as your runway

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.300
And sprint through the path you chose

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.680
Let there be light, believe in the glory within your grasp

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.760
And run headlong into the despair in front of you

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.940
Let there be light
There is only one reason I kick the ground

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.110
Let there be light

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.190
It is so I shine brighter and soar higher than before

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.200
Let there be light, so that your brilliance of today

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.040
Shows your friends who are lost The way to the future

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.710
To those who bear the cross of their dreams

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.010
The warriors who seek eternal glory Let there be light
