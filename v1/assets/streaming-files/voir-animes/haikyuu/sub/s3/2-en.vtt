00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.990
Ushiwaka's amazing.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.950
I'm getting excited!

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.950
All right, here we go!

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.080
Hello there, Left.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.540


00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.550


00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.180
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.230
Ushijima! Ushijima!

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.230
If Nishinoya couldn't...

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.270
Shake it off! You'll get the next one!

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.190
Yeah.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.730
Don't worry about it!

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.900
Focus on the next one!

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.490
Give us a good serve!

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.990
It's going out!

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.530
Yes!

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.410
Sorry!
Nice serve, Taichi!

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.500
Give us another good serve, Kawanishi!

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.380
Got it!
Tanaka!

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.220
Sorry!
My bad.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.720
It's fine!

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.180
Are they nervous after all?
Get the next one!

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.300
Their movements are really stiff.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.640
Damn it.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.480
If we don't stage a comeback soon, it'll be too late.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.690
Calm down!

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.310
There's no time to self-destruct!

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.190
U-Um...
What the hell are you babies so afraid of?! The TV crews?!

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.530
Quit fucking around!

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.280
Got it! We got it, so calm down!

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.830
Suga's scary... I'm so sorry!

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.420
He's using the old trick. Get yelled at by someone even more tense than you are, and you get calmer.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.500
I don't care how it happens.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.790
I just need them to score once and build momentum.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.760
Damn, the ref totally just gave me the stink eye...

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.390
Give us another good serve!

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.180
Got it!

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.100
Yes! He got it up cleanly!

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.680
Go!

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.770
Nice receive!

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.360
Wakatoshi!

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.240
All right!

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.160
Shake it off! You'll get the next one!

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.030
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.000
Ushijima! Ushijima!

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.120
Give me three.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.960
I promise I'll adapt to it.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.300
Huh? I thought something was weird!

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.970
Again!
Shiratorizawa's number one is left-handed?

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.430
So that's why he approaches from the right.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.720
Ryuu always goes in from the left.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.350
Yeah.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.100
Man, talk about being fated to be an ace.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.440
Ushiwaka's position is called "opposite,"

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.820
and they're diagonal from the setter.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.780
On Karasuno's side, it's where Sawamura is.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.910
Depending on how the player in that position plays, the team's tactics change completely.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.120
One strategy is to have an all-rounder who's good at defense like Sawamura there.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.040
Got it!

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.660
All right!

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.330
Nice, Daichi!

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.410
Left!

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.130
You see a lot of this with high school teams.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.090
The other strategy is to have a cannon like Ushiwaka there.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.500
Nice receive!

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.720
They don't receive serves and are always prepared to attack from both the front and back row.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.560
A while back, they were called super aces.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.610
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.650
Ushijima! Ushijima!

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.070
I mean, I get that the bastard's tall and has a lot of power in his attacks,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.700
but does the fact that he's left-handed make him that—

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.410
Bring it!

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.870
All right!

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.420
Nice spike, Tanaka!

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:20.510
Go, go, Karasuno! Push it, push it, Karasuno!

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.180
We finally got a point... Way to go, Ryuu!

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.970
So, what's so special about the lefty?

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.600
Since they go up against people who are right-handed way more often,

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.480
playing against someone who's left-handed is unbelievably difficult.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.570
For example, if you're jumping up to block somebody,

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.070
you want to jump in front of their dominant arm.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.780
Which means they're offset by about a shoulder's width.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.450
So unless the attack is a very simple one, the showdown is over in an instant.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.660
Give us a good serve, Asahi!

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.080
If you jump based on your intuition...

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.130
A delayed timing attack.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.050
...you'll end up missing, no matter what.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.010
What the hell are they doing?

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.260
Karasuno's blocks are full of holes!

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.970
Ushijima! Ushijima!
It's not just the fact that he's left-handed that makes him good.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.390
His firepower is also top-notch.
Nice spike, Wakatoshi! I see you're as sharp as ever.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.230
Yeah.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.690
That's the kind of player Ushiwaka is.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.570
They've already gone on a four-point streak because of Ushijima.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.400
Yeah.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.370
Their setter's pretty reliable, and I'm sure he wanted to get a decisive lead early.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.400
Switch gears!

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.780
Right!

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.290
Huh? What's that buzzer for?

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.250
Oh, this is a technical timeout.
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.460
What's that?

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.710
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.340
It's a timeout that only happens during best-of-fives when a team hits 8 or 16 points...

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.170
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.260
Apparently.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.590
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.220
I see...

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.680
Blocking all comes down to timing!
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.100
If he can beat your blocks, getting in place for a receive will be hard too!
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.020
Even if you can't stop it, you need to make contact!
Shiratorizawa!

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.690
Make Ushijima feel like there's a wall in his way!

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.320
Shiratorizawa!
Yes, sir!

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.160
He touched it!

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.200
Damn it!

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.580
Wow... Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.830
Ushiwaka just doesn't stop.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.050
Ushijima! Ushijima!
Shake it off! Get the next one!

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.460
That's it! Just keep that up!

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.050
Keep letting him know that there's a wall there.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.010
Then a path will open up!

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.720
Shiratorizawa has Ushiwaka.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.640
In that case... Karasuno has me.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.770
That's right.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.950
Stopping all of Ushijima's attacks, or even digging them out, is impossible.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.360
But...

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.490
all you've got to do is make those spikes that are impossible to dig out possible.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.250
Total defense.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:01.960
As we've seen in past matches, Ushijima's really good at cross-court spikes, so we're going to focus our block there

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.960
and place Nishinoya in the now-clear path of a straight spike.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.930
Make it so he's spiking toward our libero.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.930
Their timing is perfect!

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.900
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.780
Ushijima! Ushijima!

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.910
If Yuu can't dig those out, he's going to be impossible to handle.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.540
I think it's because of the spin.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:47.340
When a left-handed person hits a ball, the way it starts to spin is different from when a right-handed person does it.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.800
Volleyball is a sport where you can't hold the ball,

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.510
and the area you contact it with is extremely narrow.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:00.900
So if the way it hits your arms in that instant is even a tiny bit off, it causes a huge deviation.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.650
We can score here!

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.410
Damn it! I'm sorry!

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.790
We're too late.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.300
Nice spike, Ushijima!

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:32.760
It may be called total defense, but even just getting their timing down isn't easy.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.180
Ushijima! Ushijima!

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.760
Concentrate on getting one point at a time!

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.520
Do you think you could stop Ushiwaka?

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.770
Of course not.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.240
All right!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.450
I've been focusing on Ushiwaka too hard.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.660
Kawanishi! Kawanishi!
Is that kid with the glasses even trying?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.120
He needs to show some more of that fighting spirit!

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.830
They're sneaking in some fast attacks really well.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.920
They've gotta hurry and do something about the left-handed guy.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.800
I guess there's not much they can do about how much they're used to right-handed spikes.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.600
All right!
Sorry!

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.310
It's fine.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.940
At least Kei isn't the type of player to let his feelings get carried away with him.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.060
Give us a good serve!

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.570
He doesn't believe in his own strength.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.280
And he doesn't trust the instincts he's cultivated.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.360
Nice receive!

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.490
You're his older brother! How can you say that?!

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.780
I'm complimenting him!

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.250
You see, my little brother is such a cool customer that it's a letdown.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.920
He only trusts what he can see.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.340
Got it.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.730
Kei was in the path of that spike.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.360
He was also positioned correctly on the left, so why couldn't he block it?

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.190
You almost had it, Nishinoya!

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.570
Look at how you were able to react to his spike in time!

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.530
The spike that I actually got in front of was definitely not hit at full strength.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:27.880
He's probably still getting warmed up and is focusing on looking for gaps in our blocking.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.920
I remember from junior high how hard it is to receive the ball from someone left-handed.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.640
I guess even his love taps are killer.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.970
Tsukki, man! Is your finger jammed?! Are you okay?!

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.310
Did you have to make that rhyme?

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.150
I'll bandage you. Give it here.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.940
Thanks.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.400
This is a pretty common injury, isn't it?

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.110
I'm lucky that it's not even that bad.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.150
There you go.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.160
Thank you.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.410
Did I hesitate back there?

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.370
No, I thought I'd lose.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.120
I just assumed I would.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.760
Guys!

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.550
You look stiff!

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.890
Relax! Relax! Re... lax.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:30.440
Ushijima's really good at serving too, right?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:37.240
He doesn't have monster precision or control like Oikawa, but his power speaks for itself.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.380
Nice serve!

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.170
I don't get it.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.920
What's with that guy?

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.680
If Shiratorizawa's lead gets any bigger, this'll be a tough game to watch.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.510
Sorry! I'll get the next one!

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.430
Right!

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.980
I'm glad I don't have to receive serves right now.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.520
Trying to take that serve head-on is crazy,

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.820
and it's like the whole gym is cheering for Shiratorizawa.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.860
We're probably going to have to give up the first set, and then...

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:21.950
Bring it.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.280
Bring it! Bring it!

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.710
Bring it! Bring it! Bring it!

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.000
Do it again!

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.540
Bring it to me!

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.210
Now bring it!

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.100
He got it up!

00:13:59.490 --> 00:13:59.490


00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.880
He got it up!

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.250
Yes! That's perfect!

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.590
Finish it!

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.590
Is he planning on spiking it?

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.850
All right!

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.930
Nice set, Kageyama!

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.810
I totally thought Kageyama was going to spike it.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.730
It only took him three like he said.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.020
We can't just stand around.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.070
He looked like he was going to spike but actually set the ball.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.990
Nothing less from Oikawa's junior.

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.990
What? He is?!

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.450
That sucks!

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.080
You're awfully calm for playing against Shiratorizawa.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.620
Right now I can't think of anything scarier than Oikawa.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.580
I see!

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.300
All right! Time to fight back!

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.680
Shouyou came out!

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:11.270
The first time he was put in, he got rotated out of the front row immediately.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.560
Get one in there!

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.060
Give us a good serve!

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.730
Man, he's really short.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.270
I guess that's why he's a middle blocker.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.030
Nice receive!

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.530
You're right! He really won't go for serves!

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.660
He's getting ready for a back row attack.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.370
All right!
A one-man delayed timing attack.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.960
Yay!

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.720
Tendou! Tendou!

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.260
Give us a good serve!

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.600
Out!

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.310
All right!

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.810
Nice eye!

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.980
It's not like Shiratorizawa isn't also making mistakes.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.310
We can break through!

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.860
All right!

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.780
Yes!

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.200
The fact that Kageyama and Nishinoya are playing like they normally do is nothing less than amazing.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.200
Nice serve, Kageyama!

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.080
Indeed!

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.090
Goshiki!

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.720
All right!

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.430
Did you see my super straight spike?!

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.060
Nice receive.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.930
Nah, it was a bit off.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.390
Don't you ever get tired from being so wound up about everything?
That kid's pretty good for a first-year.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.100
Let's go, Kageyama.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:41.860
Yeah.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.160
Ushijima!

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.200
All right! He got it!

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.330
Damn! I was a bit off!

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.790
The last hit's all yours, Hinata!

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.880
He hit it off the block!

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.210
That was a great rebound shot!

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.590
Let's try again!

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.100
Huh?

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.520
I'm Hinata Shouyou, from the concrete.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.810
I'm gonna crush you and go to nationals.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.080
He can receive too?!

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.540
Give it to me.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.080
Ushijima!

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.090
Yes!

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.180
Wow.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.440
Wakatoshi, who's only interested in himself, is getting fired up?

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.900
How interesting!

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.980
It's not over yet! It's just the beginning!

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.110
Switch it up!

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.570
We'll win the next set!

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.830
Wakatoshi, do you know Karasuno's number ten?

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.290
I met him on the street.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.330
The street?

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.080
He said that he was going to beat me and go to nationals.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.330
And he said that on the street?!

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.040
No, not there.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.670
Come to think of it, didn't you get in trouble for letting non-students onto school grounds?

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.510
Karasuno's number ten is so interesting!

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.090
Now I know why you like him.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.470
No, I dislike him.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.260
Huh?

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.680
I hate baseless confidence.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.690
Oh? This is even more rare.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:51.490
If he made you say this stuff, it sounds like he'll entertain me.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.660
I guess I'll work hard too.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.990
There's no reason to panic.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.370
They just happened to take the first of five sets.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.580
And on the topic of the first set...

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:09.590
Ushijima scored 11 points, which is nearly half.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:17.300
But the fact that Shiratorizawa keeps giving him the ball means you've started to get under their skin.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.010
Even Ushijima's human.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.270
He'll run out of stamina at some point.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:27.020
He'll eventually start to get frustrated with his attacks not always landing.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:27.980
Keep that in mind!

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.230
Yes, sir!

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.490
Bring it!

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.320
You'd better start us off strong, Tsutomu!

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.110
Right!

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:43.580
That was good.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.670
A synchronized attack!

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.880
The four of them are attacking at the same time?

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.510
All right!

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:08.600
Go, go, Karasuno! Push it, push it, Karasuno!

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.810
They tricked us.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.480
How annoying.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.110
Give us a good serve, Daichi!

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.230
Got it!

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.320
Nice receive!

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.450
Nice.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.530
Thanks.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:27.000
The fact that they're setting for their middle blockers instead of using Ushijima shows they're relaxed.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.290
And if those two middle blockers start functioning well,

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:34.000
we're not going to be able to handle Ushijima, nor their other wing spikers.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.170
Yeah!

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.050
Nice spike!

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:43.350
Our biggest hurdle in this match is, of course, Ushijima.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.180
We need some strategy to counter him first, or we don't stand a chance.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.100
And for that, we need to break down our opponents.
Give us a good serve, Asahi!

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.440
We need to keep beating them down with powerful attacks.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.740
Yes! He messed up the receive!

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.070
Ushijima!

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.660
All right!
Damn it.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.870
Shake it off!

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.040
Even if they score, we just have to keep doing what we've been doing, right?

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.340
Yeah.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.630
Ugh.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.340
That guy's serving again.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.180
Give us a good one, Wakatoshi!

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.600
I totally meant to do that!

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.060
You're starting to cry, you know.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.520
Well done, Tanaka!

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.030
Nice. They're keeping up.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:42.240
If they can get used to Ushiwaka's left-handedness, they have a chance at winning!

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.330
You'll be begging for mercy when I'm done with you, Ushiwaka!

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.040
Did something happen between Hinata and Ushiwaka?

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.710
Apparently they had a bit of a run-in.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.580
What?!

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.710
He sure keeps causing trouble with other schools behind our backs!

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.670
Don't play it safe.
Bring it!

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.010
Just keep on attacking.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.600
That's the only strategy we can use.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.560
Here's our chance!

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.440
Give it to me!

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.940
It's that diagonal jump again!

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.040
If you wanna beat Wakatoshi, you're gonna have to go through me.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.210
Got it?

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:41.550


00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.510


00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:19.520
The more attention Wakatoshi gets, the bigger impact I have when I appear.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.860
Tendou, your personality really is garbage.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.190
Stop! No spoilers!

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:24.690
Next time on Haikyuu!!:

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:25.940
"The Guessing Monster."

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.760
Got a wish that can't be forced through

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.640
Barely hanging on and staying true

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.600
With a little help from timing and your crew

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.350
You can still stay standing

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.350
Wanna take the fight head-on

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:57.110
Might get lost, but keep on keeping on

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.690
'Cause that's where your chance lies

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.070
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.700
The rest is up to you

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.120
Make your dreams and ideals come true

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.870
Or sit tight and let the future pass on through

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.040
The rest is up to you

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.260
You ain't the luckiest of guys

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.670
And you ain't anywhere near wise

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.600
The winds of change are too bright for your eyes

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.930
But you wanna have all the luck

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.480
Stuff all the wisdom junk in your trunk

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:39.400
And live holding your head up high

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.730
The rest is up to you, yes

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:50.740
It's all up to you People might call you naive

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.540
And say you're not doing it right

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.410
But the rest is up to you

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.670
Don't lose your way, and push on anew

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:06.300
It's all up to you

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.880
Light a fire in every cell of your body

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.220
By taking a deep, long breath

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.970
Turn your blood and tears into offerings

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.680
Carry a torch fueled by your desires

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.900
And scream out at full volume Let there be light

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.950
With a prayer for the future, start your sprint

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.200
Let there be light, use the dark as your runway

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.840
And sprint through the path you chose

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.220
Let there be light, believe in the glory within your grasp

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.300
And run headlong into the despair in front of you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.480
Let there be light
There is only one reason I kick the ground

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.650
Let there be light

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.730
It is so I shine brighter and soar higher than before

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.740
Let there be light, so that your brilliance of today

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:39.580
Shows your friends who are lost The way to the future

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.250
To those who bear the cross of their dreams

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.550
