00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
All right!

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.440
Boys' Bathroom

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.020
You're such a freckle face, Tadashi.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.830
Why are you so puny?

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.250
You've got to bulk up, so you get to carry all of our bags.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.290
Seriously? You're crying?

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.960
He cries about everything!

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.590
You crybaby.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.120
What're you looking at?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.720
Hey, isn't he a sixth grader?

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.560
No, he's just from class 3.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.690
Lame.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.000
What'd you mean?!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.480
Hey, wait a sec!

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.250
What?

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.280
Y-You're lame, four-eyes!

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.600
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.290
H-Hey, wait a sec.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.720
"Lame."

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.760
At the time, Tsukki might have actually been talking about me, too.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.720
But more importantly,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.270
the fact that he was able to say that to the bullies who threatened me...

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.880
That made him look really cool, and I was envious.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.690
I wanted to be like that.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.500
What about you, Yamaguchi?

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.480
What would you say to Tsukishima?

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.340
Haikyu!!

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.130
Episode 08: Illusionary Hero I'm heading out.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.370
Okay.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.400
Good work!

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.840
Hey, Tsukishima!

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.550
We're gonna practice the synchronized attack, so help us out for a sec.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.510
I can still go, too.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.930
There'll be three wing spikers, but that's okay, isn't it?

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.540
I wanna get the timing down.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.060
Wait... You aren't trying to become a regular, are you?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.030
Don't think I'm gonna be warming that bench forever.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.600
Bring it on!

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.490
Daichi-san, let's hurry up and do this.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.520
Let me rest for a bit.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.200
Good job!
Daichi-san!

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.700
I can't afford to take this so lightly.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.880
It's just a club.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.180
Miyagi Prefecture Junior High All-Around Sports Tournament Volleyball

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.110
Left! Left!

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.180
#4!

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.210
Oh, my! It's Tsukishima-kun again!

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.100
Nothing less from the ace!

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.800
Hey!
Tsukishima, nice kill!

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.480
All right!

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.940
Amemaru Junior High School Volleyball Club

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.940
Where you gonna go to high school, Ni-chan?

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.410
Karasuno.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.570
They're a powerhouse school that rivals Shiratorizawa right now.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.010
I'm gonna go to nationals when I get to high school!

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.700
Karasuno High School Volleyball Club I'm home.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.180
Welcome back!

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.240
Were you stay late doing extra practice again?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.600
Everyone's really skilled, so I can't afford to slack off.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.660
Not to mention, Coach Ukai is really strict.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.140
But...

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.780
I'm totally going to try to get a regular spot in my first year!

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.650
There're a lot of club members, right?

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.490
That'd be awesome if could make regular.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.110
Right?

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.370
Mom!

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.400
Welcome home.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.280
I need three lunches tomorrow, too!

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.590
For morning practice, lunch time, and then right before club.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.330
Got it. High in protein and low-fat, right?

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.430
Yep! Thanks!

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.990
The lady at the butcher shop today said,

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.480
"It's amazing that your brother's on the Karasuno volleyball team."

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.340
Ni-chan, you have a match tomorrow, right?

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.920
Can I come watch?

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.450
Hmm... I'll get nervous if you watch, so nope!

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.210
Aw...

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.050
Hey, what's your position right now?

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.590
The same as junior high?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.370
Yeah.
So you're the ace!

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.860
Yup!

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.990
What about you, Kei?

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.340
You just joined a youth team, right?

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.830
I hate receiving.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.290
At first, it doesn't go the way you want it to at all, right?

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.000
Here, get into position.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.160
Here we go.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.430
Kei, don't try to raise it with your arms.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.940
See, you lower your hips

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.200
and then do it like you're sending it off with your whole body.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.620
Throw it to me a sec.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.710
Wow!

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.110
Receiving is where everything begins in volleyball.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.930
Connections mean everything in volleyball.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.960
Are you getting along with the other kids okay?

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.870
Yeah... Liar!

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.160
It's written all over your face!

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.330
Karasuno General Sports Park Indoor Gymnasium

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.520
Hi.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.470
Ah! Um...

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.360
Thank you for the other day.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.180
Have we met?

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.130
The... other day... a-at the park...

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.610
Oh. So, what are you doing here?
The park...

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.880
Oh, um...

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.150
I wanted to play some kind of sport...

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.070
There are a lot of scary guys in baseball and soccer,

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.340
but this seemed safe.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.990
Ah!

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.480
Those shoes are awesome!

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.000
I still only have the school-issued gym shoes.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.250
Mine are hand-me-downs.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.860
These were my older brother's, and I'm using them until I get my own next week.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.840
Your brother plays volleyball, too?

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.760
He plays at a really strong high school called Karasuno.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.950
He's like the ace.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.140
H-He's the ace of a powerhouse school?!

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.180
Th-That's awesome!

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.260
N-Nah... It's not that big of a deal.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.700
He's been one ever since junior high.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.900
Wow!

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.900
How long has he been playing?

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.210
Did he play on this team?

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.610
Aces are totally cool!

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.070
I'm home.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.540
How was your practice match today?

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.510
Yeah, it went great!

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.750
I got a lot of spikes in!

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.340
That's cool.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.350
Let's practice passing.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.720
After we're done eating.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.350
Yamaguchi.
What's the next class?

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.050
Japanese!

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.810
I'm gonna go to Karasuno's match tomorrow, but do you wanna come?

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.270
My brother told me not to come because it'll make him nervous,

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.100
but since my brother's a third-year,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.530
this is his final match in the prefecture.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.120
I'll go! I've never seen Akiteru-kun play.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.870
Tsukishima, your brother's in Karasuno's volleyball club, too?

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.240
So's mine.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.320
Friendship What position does your brother play?

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:38.990
Wing spiker.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.960
Hey! So does mine.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.710
That team practically has a caste system, so it's rough.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.280
If you can't even play in matches,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.860
you really have to wonder if going to a powerhouse school is worth it.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.380
Tsukki's brother plays in the matches.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.130
Wha? No way.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.820
I saw a match recently,

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.020
and none of the regulars were named Tsukishima.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.470
That can't be true.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.880
I hear about the matches all the time.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.220
It's gotta be some kind of mistake.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.220
You can see for yourself at the match.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.500
Yeah, I can.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.160
South
Miyagi Prefecture High School General Sports Tournament Volleyball &lt;Boys'&gt;

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.820
One more!

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.340
Nice receive!

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.300
They're going left! Left!

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.920
That's awesome! #10 did it again!

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.380
He's only around 170cm, too!

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.190
And he's only a second-year, right?

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.150
See?

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.640
The one of the left is the third-year, Kawada-kun,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.500
and on the other side is the second-year ace who they call the Little Giant.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.290
For about a year now!

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.860
We get it!

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.830
We can see that...

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.320
My brother's also a third-year and hasn't been in any matches.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.300
Slice.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:20.720
It wasn't like a movie or drama, where there's spurts of blood and heads go flying.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.350
This was far more shocking.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.360
My brother wasn't on the court.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.950
One more!

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.980
Nice serve!

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.280
Fly

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.010
How lame.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.760
It was only a club,

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.380
but it was everything to my brother.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.800
In the end, it made my brother tell pointless lies.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.280
So you're the ace!

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.720
Yup!

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.150
But my brother probably believed...

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.660
...that he could be the ace if he tried hard.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.780
But so what if he did?

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.970
Would it be worth all of that trouble?

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.250
Tsukki!

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.820
What?

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.840
Tsukki, you were always able to do anything while being cool and smart,

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.650
so I've always been jealous.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:44.850
And?

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.000
But you're being lame lately, Tsukki!

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.610
Hinata might become the Little Giant some day.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.420
That just means you have to beat him, Tsukki!

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.980
You just need to become an even better player than Hinata

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.950
and prove your skills!

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.820
You have the height, brains, and instinct,

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.950
so why do you decide that getting any better is impossible?

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.340
Even if...

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.360
I worked really hard and became the best player on Karasuno's team,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.240
what would happen after that?

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.550
Even if there's a tiny chance we might make it to nationals,

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.600
what happens after that?

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.700
No matter how high you climb, there's always someone better.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.100
Even if you are able to show some results somewhere,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.650
you'll never actually be number one!

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.140
You're gonna lose somewhere!

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.760
You all know that, so how can you keep going?!

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.650
What else do we need besides pride?!

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.770
To think this day would come...

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.420
When did you become so cool?

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.220
You're actually cool.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.600
T-Tsukki? What's wrong?
If anything...

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.250
It's at least better than my worn-out train of thought.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.040
But I can't accept that.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.910
Huh?

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.170
I'm gonna go ask something.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.070
Tsukki?!

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.010
Hey, Daichi.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.110
Yeah?

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.580
You sure it's okay to leave Tsukishima alone?

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.380
If you force someone to do it,

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.030
it's not actually free practice.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.480
I know, but...

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.230
Ever since we had our first 3-on-3,

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.380
I haven't been that worried.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.310
But if there's even the slightest chance that Tsukishima says he's gonna quit,

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.490
I'll do whatever I have to to stop him,

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.250
so I might need you to help me out then.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.330
I don't understand how Tsukishima thinks.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.700
We're basically developing at this point,

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.250
and we don't know the limits of our potential.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:28.020
Even if we felt those limits, we would still keep aiming higher.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.800
I can't see any logic or reason in his behavior.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.960
True...

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:52.490
Haikyu!!

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.950
Gymnasium #1

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.760
Yamaguchi-kun said something in a weird voice as he ran off,

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.140
but I wonder if he's okay.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.180
Weird voice?

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.980
"Tsukki!"

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.510
Like that.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.100
Oh, so he went to see Tsukishima.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.300
Did something happen?

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.830
Yeah... He seemed a bit worried about Tsukishima.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:14.760
I see.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.960
Tsukishima never does anything that's lame.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.890
He never fails at tests.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.730
He always does things like whoosh!

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.040
And swish!

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.860
Yeah...

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.480
What exactly is the difference between "whoosh" and "swish"?

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.110
So I think he'll be okay.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.720
Being good in volleyball or sucking at it,

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.460
I think it's obvious which one's cooler.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.160
Gymnasium #3

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.990
Oh?

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.510
What's this? What's this?

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.800
There's something I'd like to ask you. May I?

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.300
Sure!

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.180
Thank you very much.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.080
Both of your schools

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.210
are sometimes considered powerhouse schools, right?

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.450
Well, yeah.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.840
Even if you were able to make it to nationals,

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.660
actually winning there would be difficult, right?

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.720
But not impossible!

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.500
Now, now, let's hear him out.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.270
This is just a what-if.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:12.570
I seriously can't figure out how everyone can be so determined.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.150
Volleyball is just a club,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.640
and maybe you'll get to write,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.880
"I worked really hard in my club in high school,"

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.050
on your resume, right?

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.960
"Just a club"?

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.210
That almost sounds like someone's name.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.380
Ooh, like Mary Club?

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.310
No wait, I guess it was "just some club."

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.950
Aw, man! So it doesn't sound like someone's name.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.480
Man, I was so close!

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.300
Damn it!

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.090
Are you basically asking me to retort?

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.850
Nah. There'll be no end to it.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.170
Say, four-eyes.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.420
It's Tsukishima.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.600
Say, Tsukishima-kun...

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.650
Is volleyball fun?

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:55.660
No, not really... Maybe that's because you suck.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.300
I'm a third-year and I've been to nationals,

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.890
and I'm better than you. Like way better.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.580
You don't have to tell me that.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.100
But I only recently starting thinking that volleyball was fun.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.880
Ever since my straight became usable in matches.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:19.260
Straight

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.260
Because my cross hits that I was really good at kept getting blocked,
Cross

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.020
I got frustrated and practiced the hell out of straights.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.230
And...

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.350
At the next tournament, the same blockers couldn't touch it.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.860
I got right past them.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.890
Just that one shot made me feel like my time had finally come.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.530
It all depends on if you have that moment or not.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:55.290
It doesn't really matter what happens in the future,

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.050
or if you can win your next match.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.260
The joy you feel beating the guy in front of you,

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.730
and when you're able to pull out 120% of your potential, is everything.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.250
Well, at least that's how it is for me,

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.270
and it doesn't mean that applies to everyone.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.990
I don't really understand why you say it's "just a club,"

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.910
but I don't think you're wrong.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.370
But once that moment arrives for you,

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.290
that's the moment you'll be hooked on volleyball.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.320
All right. I answered your question, now help with blocking.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.950
All right, now. Come on, hurry it up.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.090
Wait, what...

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.680
Ah, Yamaguchi-kun came back.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.760
Yamaguchi, where's Tsukishima?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.000
It looks like he got caught by the Nekoma and Fukurodani captains.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.150
What?! I'm so jealous.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.320
Maybe I'll go, too.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.640
Hinata, do you think of Tsukki as your rival?

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.570
Huh?

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.080
Of course I do!

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.040
We play the same position, and he has everything I don't.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.540
But I'm not gonna lose to him!

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.750
I've gotta practice!

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.580
Captain! I'm coming in!

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.570
If Hinata and Tsukishima-kun are rivals, Sure.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.000
it's like the sun versus the moon.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.050
"Hi" means "sun" and "tsuki" means "moon."

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.140
Yeah, you're right!

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.070
Yeah!

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.780
I hope that happens...

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.740
#4!

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.000
Eek... All right!

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.780
That #4 is really intense again today.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.550
Sensei.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.620
Fukurodani Karasuno All right!

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.420
Even if you're not able to stop #4's spikes,

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.960
at least try to touch it.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.840
Right!

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.410
I see... So even if they aren't able to stop it,

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.970
if they're able to touch the ball, it reduces the momentum?

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:06.140
Right. There are usually two goals in blocking.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.780
There's the soft block that's used in order to make the ball easier to receive,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.100
and the kill block that's used to completely shut the ball out.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.520
Kill... as in, killing something?

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.150
Yes.
Eek!

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.570
We don't have to stop it?

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.200
Well...

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.290
If you're able to actually shut the ball out, there's nothing better.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.670
All right!
Fukurodani            Karasuno

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.590
Nice receive!

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.800
Give it to me!

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.010
Left! #4, #4!

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.720
First, you need to visualize it.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.560
Concentrate your strength to your fingertips,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.720
so you're not blown back.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.230
And put your hands in front of you, instead of over your head.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.150
In front.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.390
And then, make this annoying owl shut up!

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:00.920
Just try it!

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:08.030
Um... a soft block that reduces the ball's momentum, and...

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.540
The one who kills the spike...

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.650
Feint!

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.920
Damn it!

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.600
Wow, I totally thought they were going to come with a full-on attack there.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.830
To think it was actually a feint...

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.580
I guess that's what you get with an ace that went to nationals.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.850
Daichi-san, that was... Yeah.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.110
Bokuto-san just ran away.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.610
I did not! I just got around it!

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.930
And really well! I got around their block!

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:46.700
You let your guard down.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.990
Ugh! Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry!

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.000
Well, now...

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:05.300
Perhaps the troublesome little baby bird is starting to come out of his shell.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.600
Oh...

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.900
The sun versus the moon?

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.980
Tsukki! Jump some blocks for us!

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.900
Could you please not call me that?

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.780
Then... How about Glasses-kun?

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.560
All right, let's do this thing, Akaasshi!

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.540
Now somehow I'm involved.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:00.410
Episode 09: "VS "Umbrella""

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.010
Next time on Haikyu!!: "VS "Umbrella"."
