WEBVTT

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.400
Oh, Hitoka-chan. Are you done changing?

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.020
I'll walk with you, so hold on a sec.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.150
I'm going to go change, too.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.760
No, it's okay.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.680
I actually think I should be walking with you, or something, or...

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.910
Don't worry about it.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.500
What's wrong, Sensei?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.330
Why the serious face?

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.040
Oh, well...

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.350
Apparently, the bus we were supposed to take for the away games in Tokyo

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.130
was booked by another club, so it doesn't look like we'll get it.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.460
It looks like it's going to cost us a lot more than expected,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.090
so I was trying to figure out what to do.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.560
I'll try talking to a few more alumni.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.250
I'm sure this problem'll come up again in the future.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.060
I apologize. I'll try reaching out, as well.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.020
Well, if all else fails, I do have some savings.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.470
No, no, no. You need to save that for your future wedding, or something.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.570
And don't do that with your hand!

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.200
Yachi-san!

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.940
Yachi-san, are you gonna be our manager?

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.160
Uh, um... You will, right?

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.460
Hey, first-year girl, hey!

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.320
We hope that you will join the Karasuno High School volleyball team.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.950
Huh?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.170
When you're around, Kiyoko-san talks a lot.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.540
What kind of invitation is that, you idiots?!

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.000
Sorry these guys are so stupid.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.340
No, not at all!

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.120
Um... I'm flattered.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.100
I've never tried to do something on my own,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.020
or had someone need me for anything...

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.850
Even in drama club, I've only been an extra.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.340
Like Townsperson B or a tree.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.860
A tree?

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.940
So when Shimizu-senpai worked so hard to recruit a Townsperson B,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.030
like me, who has no experience or knowledge of volleyball,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.720
I was really happy.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.860
But I'm sure I'm not much—

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.670
I totally get how you feel.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.980
Even if Kiyoko-san said,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.100
"I'm going to steal money from you, so follow me."

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.090
I'd still follow her.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.190
You're so manly, Ryu!

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.480
Uh, I think that's a bit different.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.940
That sounds sorta awesome!

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.600
Looks like Tanaka's saying something again.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.050
Oh, that reminds me...

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.320
From: Kozume Kenma Subject: None We made it through the first round. This week is round two of prelims.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.030
Damn! Nekoma's so awesome!

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.940
I'm getting fired up!

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.840
Haikyu!!

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.000
Episode 3  Townsperson B Hitoka.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.800
I've got to go to one more meeting, so I'm going to be home late.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.350
Okay. See you later, Mom.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.080
Make sure you clean up over here.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.640
Okay.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.520
Hm? What's this?

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.390
Karasuno High School Boys' Volleyball Club Members and Manager Seeking Members!! Please Contact Shimizu Kiyoko in Class 3-2

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.700
Oh, well...

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.050
I was invited to be a manager for the boys' volleyball team.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.120
Volleyball?

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.580
Yeah...

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.840
Oh, I'll be right there. Just a moment.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.530
Yes, ma'am.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.040
Didn't Karasuno's volleyball team make it to nationals before?

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.390
It's a strong school, right?

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.990
Yes.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.440
Apparently they're getting strong again.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.890
The taxi's here.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.210
Do you even know anything about volleyball?

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.960
Well, I plan on learning more about it.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.270
That's fine and all,

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.300
but joining passionate people when you aren't going to give it your all

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.890
is the rudest thing you could do.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.170
I'm counting on you to make breakfast tomorrow.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.100
Oh, right...

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.270
Senpai, why did you have to say it like that?

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.900
You're so cold.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.520
I-I didn't mean it like that!

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.450
You're probably the reason why Hitoka-chan's a bit negative, Senpai.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.170
I just want her to be stronger!

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.000
But if she's going to give up just because of what I said,

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.230
she'll lose hope over even smaller things in the future, too.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.390
Girls' Changing Room Club Application

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.310
Is something troubling you?

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.070
By the way, I did play sports,

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.760
but I had no prior experience with volleyball or being a manager.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.360
I don't think everyone has to like something before giving it a try.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.640
I don't think you need an unwavering will

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.830
or lofty motive just to get started.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.880
Sometimes things that you start on a whim

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.290
end up becoming very important to you, too.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.210
To get started, I think you just need a little bit of curiosity.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.720
Hinata and Tsukishima.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.680
Yes!
Yes.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.500
Since you two are middle blockers,
The floor's wet. Could I get the mop?

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.510
you have to be able to use blocks as your weapon.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.550
Yup. Where is it?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.210
I need you to be so good at blocking, you could stop Ushiwaka.
Right around here. Thanks.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.650
Keep that in mind for today's practice match, too.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.950
Gotcha!

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.150
Right... There's no way we could block Ushiwaka...

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.260
All right, get back to practice.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.150
Right!

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.870
By the way, Sensei, how are their exams?

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.060
Especially with the four idiots.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.820
Um... Ouginishi will arrive in four and a half hours.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.990
Right!

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.170
All right, Hitoka-chan.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.100
Would you line up some chairs around the court there?

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.210
Let's see... Eight of them.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.050
Uh, right!

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.400
If they're heavy, one at a time is fine.
Kiyoko-san is smiling.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.060
I-I'm fine.
The world is at peace yet again today.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.330
Want some help?

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.890
No, it's fine. You do your own thing.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:59.730
Okay!

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.240
I'm not gonna lose today!

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.040
Um... Today's match is a practice match, right?

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.860
Yup.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.070
Um... I was wondering why you can study so hard to play in away games

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.790
and get so fired up for a practice game.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.000
Huh? Because I want to get stronger and win.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.030
I-I see...

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.610
I'm sure you have your reasons.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.520
Huh? Reasons?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.060
Reasons why I wanna win?

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.430
Oh. Yeah...

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.680
Do you need a reason not to want to lose?

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.640
Hey, Kageyama.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.190
Is there a reason you don't want to lose?

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.830
Wha? How would I know?

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.860
Is there a reason you want to eat when you're hungry?

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.250
Right? Hmm...

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.780
So this on the same level as hunger?

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.720
Sorry... that was an inane question.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.870
"Inane question"?

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.610
"A foolish question, or a comment said to abase oneself after asking such a question."

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.080
We just went over it the other day!

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.340
Thank you for having us!

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:06.960
Gather round!

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.970
Right!

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.180
All right. We're going to line up, too.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:13.880
Okay!

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.930
Whoa...

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.740
Everyone's big over there, too.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.270
Do you need a reason not to want to lose?

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.360
I don't think you need an unwavering will

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.700
or lofty motive just to get started.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.930
Move back a bit, Hinata.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.980
Oh, right.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.950
Bow!

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.420
Let's play!

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:55.970
Haikyu!!

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.580
So we're playing Karasuno today?

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.930
They're the, uh...

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.930
The "fallen giant" and the "flightless bird," right?

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.030
I don't think those names apply anymore.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.650
Huh?

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.540
At the IH prelims, they played Aoba Johsai a full set

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:15.990
Ouginishi High School Volleyball Club

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.180
and had a deuce with them until their scores got into the 30s.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:15.990
Seriously?!

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.850
Oh, but they do have Nishinoya from Chidoriyama

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.000
and Kageyama from Kitagawa Daiichi, right?

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.370
They do, but...

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.960
Senpai?

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.710
Their #10, especially...

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:34.230
Karasuno's center is a first-year with impressive physical abililty.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.770
Sometimes, his presence changes the game to an astonishing extent.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.540
It appears that Karasuno's transforming.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.730
Thank you for coming so far!

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.480
Nice kill!

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.440
Nice kill!

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.650
Nice kill!

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.570
We're gonna start soon, so get changed!

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.640
Right.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.110
Hinata, that's backwards.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.070
Like Jamila.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.660
Sorry, you'll have to get used to this.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.650
Asahi-san, that string in your hair is awesome!

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.380
String?

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.720
It's a hairband.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.150
Well, I guess I feel confident if you say that, Nishinoya.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.220
Straighten up!

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.960
Trying to change your image, Asahi-san?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.090
No, the other day...

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.390
What is it, Shimizu?

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.650
Azumane, you hair braid is so tight it makes me think you'll go bald.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.900
That's why...

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.730
I need to be careful, too.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.800
There are some hot bald guys, though.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.340
I'm not bald!

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.210
Aren't you going to get into your uniform, Tanaka-san?

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.450
I'm about to!

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.660
A flock of birds... A flock... True, they are crows.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.560
But once the game starts, they actually get along great.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.840
Gather round!

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.800
This is our first match with another team since the Inter-High prelims.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.710
You haven't forgotten your frustrations from then, have you?

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.860
Right!

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.980
All right, go out there and raise some hell!

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.770
Right!

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.440
Karasuno, fight!

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.480
Yeah!

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.640
Here we go!

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.940
Yeah!

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.360
Have we played this team before?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.910
No, we haven't.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.690
Come on, bring it!

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.000
Get a point!

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.170
Yeah!

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.640
Nice serve, Kageyama!
Ouginishi      Karasuno Thanks!

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.840
Wait, did they just score a point?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.190
One more!

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.640
Hitoka-chan, the score.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.390
Oh, r-right.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.370
Cover! Cover!
#8! #8!

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.810
Only one blocker... Go!

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.960
Ouginishi Karasuno Nice, Nishinoya!
Hey, don't run!

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.410
What amazing reflexes... Kageyama!

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:56.980
Right!

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.740
Karasuno All right!

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.030
It looked like their arms would be torn off if they touched the ball.
Asahi-san, nice kill!

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.330
Nice receive, Daichi-san!
They're really calm.... Left!

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.420
Ouginishi    Karasuno All right!

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.040
Wow, that's so loud...

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:16.970
Isn't it, though?

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.130
But once their attention is taken away by the two powerhouses,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.720
they lose sight of the small crow.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.170
I can fly!

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.190
Ouginishi Karasuno If they're one step too late,

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.990
they can't catch up to him.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.790
Not yet! More!

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.200
I can hit higher than that!

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.150
Yeah.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.360
He's still not satisfied.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.960
All right!

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.430
Thank you very much!

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.750
Karasuno Ouginishi Amazing! That was amazing!

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.280
I'm only watching, and yet, I, I...

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.410
Did you feel overwhelmed?!

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.440
Yeah, I did!

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.620
Then be our manager!

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.860
Huh? Um, uh...

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.680
His conversations usually don't make any sense.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.580
Do it, Yachi-san!

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.720
Joining passionate people when you aren't going to give it your all

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.910
is the rudest thing you could do.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.830
For an amazing team like this,

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.840
a Townsperson B like me with no knowledge of sports

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.080
is just going to get in the way.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.110
Come to think of it, I played Townsperson B, too.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.050
Huh?

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.140
But I tried to stand out more than the lead and I got in trouble.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.040
Townsperson B... Ha.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.330
Hey, don't make fun of me, you jerk!

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.380
Townsperson B has its own kind of awesomeness!

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.380
I see.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.250
Then what kind of role did you play, Kageyama?

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.310
The moon.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.940
Is that even needed?

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.740
Damn, that's cool!

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.680
"Townsperson B has its own kind of awesomeness."

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.640
I've played a horse before.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.680
A horse?!

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.460
Man, you're a lifesaver!

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.930
Yachi-san, thanks for helping us study on a Saturday!

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.840
Thanks.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.920
Sure. Let's do our best on the exam.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.020
Oh, thanks for having us.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.390
No problem. Was she a good teacher?

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.400
Yeah!

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.600
I'm gonna ace that exam for sure now! I think!

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.850
You think?

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.190
Or rather, I won't let Yachi-san's kindness go to waste!

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.800
Kindness... "To have a caring heart."

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.950
"A term used to express a caring attitude one has for another."

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.780
Oh, the definition of the word we studied earlier.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.380
I see. Good luck on your exam.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.210
Thanks!

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.790
Let's go to Tokyo together, Yachi-san!

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.630
Huh? R-Right...

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.290
I haven't even explained anything to my mom yet!

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.990
See you next week!

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.260
B-Bye-bye...

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.040
Hitoka, what's this about away games in Tokyo?

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:20.150
W-Well, um, uh... Oh, I'm sorry I'm late. Let's go.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.000
All right, I'm heading to a meeting.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.320
I'll be back late again tonight.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.690
Oh, right.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.780
Okay, let's go.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.030
Huh? Uh, wait, Senpai.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.040
Weren't you trying to say something, Hitoka-chan?

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.080
Are you okay?

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.400
No, it's nothing.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.580
Go ahead.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.960
Okay... See you later.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.690
Yup.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.810
Come on, Senpai...

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.480
Yachi-san's notes are so awesome!

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.970
Notes should always be like this.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.980
If Yachi-san joins, we'll have two managers.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.280
We totally sound like a champion school.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.080
Yeah.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.640
What? You don't want her to join?

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.480
That's totally up to her.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.680
You never agree with anything.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.720
You're not very popular, are you?

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.440
Mind your own business!

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.240
Oh, crap! I forgot my textbook at Yachi-san's house!

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.140
I'm gonna go back and get it.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.500
See ya, Kageyama!

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.120
Here.
Comprehensive Japanese

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.200
Thanks, Yachi-san!

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.400
That was close!

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.500
I'm glad I realized it.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.900
U-Um, Hinata-san... Do you have a sec?

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.170
Sure.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.630
Huh?

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.570
You're not sure you want to join over something like that?

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.520
I've hit Kageyama in the back of the head with a serve,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.020
thrown up on Tanaka-san's lap,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.710
and accidentally knocked the vice principal's toupee off,

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.360
but I'm still playing volleyball just fine!

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.860
Would you really say you were fine, then?

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.400
But you want to do this, right, Yachi-san?

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.740
Y-Yes...

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.820
Then you totally should!

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.820
Right.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.230
Is what your mom said bothering you?

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.820
Uh, um, no... It's just that, um...

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.050
Then why don't you tell her?

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.070
She went to the station, right?

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.900
Y-Yeah... What is this?!

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.760
I feel like I'm in some shojo manga!

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.310
Wow, he's fast! He runs so fast!

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.020
Wait...

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.490
Yachi-san, at this rate, you can't move forward.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.570
If you want to do this, you need to tell her.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.950
Whether I want to join the volleyball club or not,

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.510
at this rate, I'll never be able to change from my worthless self.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.620
I have to say it with my own mouth.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.260
Yeah... I have to say it.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.340
Thanks, Hinata.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.180
Subway Platforms

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.400
You weren't strong to begin with either, were you, Senpai?

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.250
You can't expect the same strength from Hitoka-chan.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.060
Hitoka-chan's just starting to get stronger.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.820
Mom!

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.780
Hitoka?!

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.200
Townsperson B can fight, too!

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:27.210
Huh?!

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.460
Townsperson B?

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:34.420
I'm going to be the volleyball club manager!

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.780
I-I see... Do your best.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.290
I will!

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.200
What do you want to do for dinner?!

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.560
I-I'll eat at home.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.660
Roger!

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.310
All right! Two managers!

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.670
We're like champions!

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:59.820
Um, I have a favor to ask you and Kageyama-kun...

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.630
What?

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.260
You're crying?!

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.410
Shut up. Give me a tissue.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.530
Pardon me.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.960
Takeda-sensei.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.110
Yes?

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:15.340
Um, I overheard that we might not have enough money for the away games...

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.910
May I talk to you about that?

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.760
How He Lives Beggars Belief, Constantly Nicking Old Foreign Necklaces.

Knowing Careless Security Titillates Very Criminal Minds.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.720
"Experience." E-Experience...

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.120
That won't do at all.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.980
Mom!

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.820
I wouldn't even notice it at all.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.530
What do you want to show?

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.610
Who is your target audience?

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.900
How will you catch the attention of people walking by?

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.980
Truly, the Little Giant!

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.150
I have a favor to ask you and Kageyama-kun...

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.270
I want to make a poster for the volleyball club,

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.280
so would you let me take a picture of you spiking a ball?

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.290
Okay, here we go.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.740
Alright.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.230
Here we go, Kageyama.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.750
Yeah.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.910
Wow...

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.480
We're done!

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.830
How'd you do?

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.790
All right, please pass your exams forward.

Faculty Room Oh, Takeda-sensei.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:18.220
Someone's on the phone saying they saw a poster,

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.200
and they'd like to know where to donate the money for the volleyball club...

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.120
It's hot... It's just for a little while.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.540
Come on. You, too, Tsukishima.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.180
Come here! Line up.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.680
So, we've finished our exams, and starting today,

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.420
Yachi-san will officially be joining us as our manager.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.200

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.700
Welcome to the Karasuno High School Volleyball Club!

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.540
It's a pleasure to work with you!

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.440
All right. The Tokyo away games are coming up.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.390
All that's left is...

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.500
All right, I'm returning the exams.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.090
Aww... Shut it.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.260
All right, Ando... Yes.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.260
Next, Enokira.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.010
Yes.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.040
Oyama.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.690
The exams are finally coming back.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.530
Yeah... It'll be fine! You studied so hard!

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.820
Huh? Did I even write my name on it?!

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.180
What? That'd be a problem before the exam even started!

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.910
