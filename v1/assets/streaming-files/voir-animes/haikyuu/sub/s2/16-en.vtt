WEBVTT

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.960
It's up! Nice!

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.650
A feint!

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.820
Karasuno                             Johzenji

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.490
Futamata!

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.570
Again?! I'll stop them again!

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.660
This time, not with my face.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.010
Back attack!

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.260
A break...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.930
I totally thought you were going to hit that.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.260
You scared the crap out of me!

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.620
His own team didn't know he was going to do that.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.760
But he was able to hit it so calmly.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.640
They're vicious... How creepy.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.550
Johzenji seems to be doing well after their time out.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.230
Yeah... They're starting to actually look at their opponents as they're playing.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.150
That's not good.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.010
Haikyu!!

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.540
Episode 16: "Next"

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.540
I'm not saying you need to play seriously.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.100
You guys may seem stupid, but you're not, are you?

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.750
Huh?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.010
Playing doesn't equal not thinking.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.430
Left! Left!

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.790
Nice!

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.860
It's up! Get the last one!

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.680
When you're not sure they're actually going to hit,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.540
don't go up to block, and take a step back.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.820
Right on point!

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.070
I have no complaints if you actually stop them.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.770
When you know how to move

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.400
and have the skill to actually do it, that's when you can actually play freely.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.980
I guess the more we improve, the more we'll see people like that.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.340
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.330
Here he comes! #10!

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.100
Hey, listen up a sec.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.220
Johzenji hasn't been able to stop Hinata's quick yet,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.800
so they'd better get this point.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.800
Nice receive.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.540
Their #10 jumped up! That quick is coming!

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.940
Er, huh?

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.850
Johzenji's blockers aren't marking #10?

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.860
If we can't block it, it's better to go for the receive.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.560
Whoa! They did it!

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.670
They managed to counter by not marking #10!

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.790
It went over!

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.960
Playing doesn't equal not thinking.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.990
Having the simulation in your head and reality join together...

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.800
...is awesome!

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.970
Karasuno                             Johzenji
A two-point difference, huh...

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.190
This happened to them with Aoba Johsai, too.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.680
Eh?

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.220
Hinata's spike is still pretty light.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.480
I don't want to get blocked,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.890
but being ignored by the blockers is even more frustrating. Why?!

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.860
Kageyama!

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.060
Could you give me another one next time?

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.740
One more, nice serve!

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.000
Got it!

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.420
I can see it.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.090
Seriously?

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.830
Nice kill!

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.550
I guess this means things have changed since the Seijoh match.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.260
Karasuno                             Johzenji
Hinata! Give 'em one more!

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.440
A receive from that close up?

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.990
If we can touch it...

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.110
...we can control it!

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.900
All right!

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.130
So their play is to touch the ball

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.620
before we can hit it into a space they can't reach.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.520
I'll win the next one!

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.900
Hinata, isn't there a move you haven't done yet today?

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.320
Your new special move.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.510
Karasuno                             Johzenji

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.540
Nice receive!

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.510
Go, Hinata!

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.760
Bring it!

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.100
All right!

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.060
Karasuno Johzenji Match point!

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.980
All right, you guys...

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.070
Let's play for real.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.200
Simplicity and Fortitude Johzenji Parents' Association

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.200
Got it!

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.090
Another synchronized attack?!

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.930
Those guys aren't thinking about when they mess up,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.200
even for a second.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.820
Just the pleasure they feel when they succeed.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.090
Be careful! That one isn't like before!

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.360
All right!

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.090
We did it!

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.860
Now they've made it into the quarterfinals.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.860
I expected that ending....

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.540
Karasuno                             Johzenji
Are we really done? Damn it...

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.450
And I was just getting hyped up!

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.100
They still look like they want to play.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.580
They're terrifying...

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.050
Thanks.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.890
Eh?

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.770
It appears that you really do understand those guys better than I do.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.390
Because of that, they didn't completely break down.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.410
I guess I should expect that from a third-year.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.720
No...

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.310
Thank you very much!

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.070
So I wasn't imagining it.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.070
Their quick is evolving.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.320
All right. I'm gonna go on ahead.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.500
Don't stay too long.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.670
Johzenji High School Well, I guess, if anything...

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.270
I don't mind you guys getting hyped up,

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.880
just don't lose control.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.420
There's no one to whip your butts into shape anymore.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.320
All right, dismissed.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.980
Don't skip your stretches.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.950
Ah, um...

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.860
Don't you guys give Runa-chan a hard time.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.170
She's still a first-year, so I'll be watching you guys.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.800
Also... About your style where you always go all-out with playing around...

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.580
I actually like that a lot.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.690
Let's go. The next team is here.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.700
Th-Thank you very much!

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.380
You did it!

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.840
Ye-ah!

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.060
E-Eekyay?!

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.480
You both doing a jumping high-five at her is a bit much.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.930
R-Right...

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.320
Yay! Yay! Yay!

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.100
I'm going to stop you tomorrow.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.950
And I'm going to get through!

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.390
Shut up!

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.300
I wonder if he was waiting just to tell Hinata that...

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.210
The game on court B's done?

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.850
That would mean whoever won that game is our next opponent.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.060
Wakunan                                   Sensho

00:09:54.770 --> 00:10:02.120
You can do it, Takeru! Nice kill, Takeru!

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:06.180
Takeru Yeah!

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.760
His family's here to cheer him on?!

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.390
That's the team Ukai-san said

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.070
we need to look out for before the Inter-High prelims, too...

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.990
In order to fight Date Tech again,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.100
we need to beat them first!

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:35.610
Haikyu!!

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.240
Congratulations on completing the first day.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.070
Thank you!

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.570
Unlike our other opponents, Wakutani South

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.040
has third-years left on the team, just like us.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.790
They are a well-rounded team.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.220
Their defense and tenacity are close to Nekoma's.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.110
Don't lose your temper just because you can't get your attack in.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.800
Especially the hyperactive ones and simpletons.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.220
It'll be fine. We'll follow up on them.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.310
Th-Thank you very much.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.480
Damn it. They're more under control than I made it sound.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.450
Yeah, leave it to me.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.060
All right. We're going to make it through tomorrow, too.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.280
Karasuno, fight!

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.210
Yeah!

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.830
Qualifying Tournament Grouping (Boys) Winner

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:46.750
Go, go, Takeru! Go, go, Wakunan!

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.900
There are even more than yesterday.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.470
A younger brother?

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.450
Why do you look so jealous?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.310
Come on, concentrate.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:08.430
Go, go, Takeru! Go, go, Wakunan!

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.180
What's the matter, Ukai-kun?

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.390
We're going all out, Sensei.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.010
Huh?

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.940
It might just be my gut feeling,

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.280
but this Wakunan team

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.500
may be hard for our team to handle.
Karasuno                                       Wakunan

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.500
Captains.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.460
Let's play.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.250
There'll be no lowering our guard.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.470
We're honored.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.430
Heyo.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.660
Ah, Shimada-san, hello.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.370
Are you by yourself?

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.730
Takinoue has work today.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.400
He said he could probably come by in the afternoon.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.730
Man, I'm getting hyped!

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.610
This really gets you fired up, huh?

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:40.940
Hello.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.820
She reminds me of someone...

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.660
Hey! Thanks for always taking care of Ryunosuke.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.440
I'm his older sister, Saeko.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.840
Tanaka's sister!

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.800
They look alike.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.650
Ryu! Ryu-chan!

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.450
Ne-san!
Geh.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.760
I came to cheer you on!

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.220
Let's play!

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.760
Get 'em!

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.930
The second day begins... They'd better survive.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.930
Bring it!

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.230
Nice serve!

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.560
Got it!

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.190
Good! First, break through with a quick!

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.090
All right!

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.660
Hinata, nice kill!

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.120
Wh-What the heck was that?!

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.530
A quick? Was that just luck?

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.610
All right, we're shutting them down quickly next.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.190
Yes!

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.280
Yeah!

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.760
What? Wakunan doesn't seem very surprised by that quick.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.090
There's no one in Karasuno

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.280
that you can call a flightless bird anymore.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.520
They're the most outrageous team in the prefecture.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.190
We're super lucky to be able to play them.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.440
Looks like they've figured out how to deal with Hinata...

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.950
They don't seem panicked at all.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.150
I'm not sure if they're a bad match

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.150
or if they're just a team we won't do well against.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.530
Yeah.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.480
Unlike the trend up until now,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.330
where Karasuno fights a team that just keeps throwing attacks at them,

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.580
we have a problem handling teams
Their #9's serve is powerful!

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:22.480
Don't let your guard down!

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:26.120
that keep their own pace and deal with us intelligently.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.860
Right!

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.850
Seijoh and Nekoma are exactly that.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.090
I see.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.060
Opponents who aren't surprised by that quick...

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.130
Now, what are they gonna do?

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.990
Hinata, looks like

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.530
a powerhouse school is on their guard with you.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.940
They've probably been researching you...

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.450
Researching you... Researching you...

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.400
Researching you... Researching you...

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.300
A powerhouse school... researching me?

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.100
Man, you're totally overshadowing us.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.830
But I am able to triumph over myself from yesterday.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.760
Hey, if you guys are just watching Hinata, I'm gonna peck yer eyes out.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.560
Well done, Captain.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.960
He knows exactly how to get them going.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.100
Karasuno                               Wakunan
Kageyama, nice serve!

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.530
That felt perfect against my hand.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.030
That's intense!

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.780
Nice receive!

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.800
Pineapple Head is coming in from behind.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.680
He's so fast!

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:53.460
You can do it, Wakunan!

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.750
Whoa! From the furthest back?

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.750
Tabi, nice kill!

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.090
A delayed attack, huh?

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.510
So that's Wakunan's weapon, their combination...

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.840
Though their average height is not very high,

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.860
you can definitely see why they're always a top team in the prefecture.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.490
Yeah, but that's not Wakunan's only weapon.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.320
Eh?

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.950
Don't keep reacting to the spiker each time!

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:10.970
Go after the ball!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.720
I-I know that! In my head...

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.530
But your body acts on its own... I know how that feels.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.250
Karasuno                              Wakunan

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.250
Nice receive!

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.680
It's up! Cover!

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.840
Takeru! Get the last!

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.300
We're going to stop it! Ready, and...

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.030
A wipe...

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.040
All right!

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.310
They were targeting the edge of my hands.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.500
It would appear that Nakashima-kun's technique in mid-air battles

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.310
is as troublesome as his combination.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.860
Nakashima Takeru... Shiro! One more, nice serve!

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.780
His play style might be the most similar in the prefecture...

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.840
to the former Little Giant.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.920
Takeru-ni, go!

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.550
Takeru All right!

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.300
Nakashima again! So good!

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.930
This is how the pace is going to be...

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.510
They won't get too far ahead of us,

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.270
but we won't be able to take the lead.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.670
Does this mean that Nakashima-kun

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.630
can see really well, just like Hinata-kun?

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.010
I don't know just how much Nakashima can see.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.860
Rather than aiming for small spaces like Hinata,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.480
I think he uses angles.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.080
I think he changes the angle of his spikes.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.230
He'll hit it against the blocker's hand,

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.330
to change up the angle of the rebound.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.900
Tsukishima, it's written all over your face.
Concentrate on that receive!

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.940
A strong one's coming!

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.130
Well, as a blocker, spikers like that

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.840
are just plain annoying.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.350
Shiro, one more! Nice serve!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.360
Right into the center!

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.110
I knew it was coming, but it's still so fast!

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.860
Karasuno's #10 isn't losing to Wakunan's #1.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.140
All right!

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.610
Damn it!
Tanaka-san, nice serve!

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.260
You almost had it!
Yeah! Leave it to me!

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.650
You're reading them, though.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.790
You'll get the next one for sure!

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.540
Half of that is just trying to get you riled up.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.720
Don't give in.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.360
Oh?

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.990
It appears that Wakunan has one blocker on Hinata for sure,

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.140
but won't pursue, apparently.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.720
They put a tall middle blocker on Hinata,

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.000
and rather than stop him,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.850
they limit his course and make it easier to receive.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.550
It's impossible to completely stop Hinata...

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.370
They understand that,

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.160
but they're still not going to let Hinata do what he wants.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.360
But...

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:04.120
Our next generation of Little Giants

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.850
are going all out in a mid-air battle, but...

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.560
Don't forget about our kingly ace, either.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.020
Right.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.440
Looks like I don't need to say anything.
Nice serve!

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.590
I knew it. Their middle blocker is on Hinata.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.560
And the other two are dealing with our other spikers.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.730
However, if you're going to stop our ace...

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.440
You need to bring an iron wall.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.070
Damn it...

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.160
Asahi-san!

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.710
Nice kill!

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:42.740
Right...

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.560
All right, we're good.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.230
Everyone's calm. This is how we're going proceed.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.920
Damn it... It's okay. Let's get the next one!

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.630
Karasuno                                    Wakunan

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.630
#3! #3!

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.330
All right!

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.970
Is Karasuno's attacking from the left more?

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.430
That goatee guy is super strong.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.640
What?!

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.560
Karasuno Wakunan All right!
Hey, they finally have a two-point lead.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.100
It finally feels like the match is moving.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.500
All right! This is our chance!

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.780
Let's make sure we take it!

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.550
Right!

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:20.720
Damn it!

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.480
Hey, Tabi.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.530
Over on the right, in the third row, there's a super cute girl.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.530
Seriously?

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.990
Whoa!

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.550
Keep getting the ball to me!

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.460
Right, right...

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.220
I'm gonna get this next one, no matter what!

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.750
Good work, Takeru.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.670
He definitely knows Tabi well.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.130
Fight!

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.980
I'm used to surviving in a Jurassic Park filled with free-willed people.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.630
I'm gonna go play.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.430
What?!

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.170
If my house is Jurassic Park,

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.720
Yay!

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.620
this is just a zoo.
Makoto, where are you going?!

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.320
Okay, say "Ah."

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.270
Don't underestimate the second brother who's been through hell.
Aah.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.720
We're Wakunan, known for our tenacity!

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.650
This is when we show what we're worth!

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.730
Yeah!

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.820
Their captain's a pretty good foundation, as well.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.870
Yeah. If that last game was a bunch of playing,

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.790
this match is going to be about the captains.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.500
#11! #11!

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:20.940
Nice cover!
He got it again!

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.870
I'm counting on you!

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.580
They're both great at connecting.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.510
Asahi!

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.040
Nice, Akiu!
He got it again!

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.880
Cover! Cover!
It's hard to even watch.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.680
This is the longest rally of the day.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.090
Whoever gets this is going to get the momentum of the game.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.610
Don't let your guard down!

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.890
We're definitely going to get this one!

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.150
Yeah!

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.730
Takeru, I'm counting on you!

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:40.580
Yeah!

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:41.690
Three blockers!

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.360
Another wipe...

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.140
Go!
Get the last one over!

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.250
We did it!
All right!

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.310
Er...

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.460
Huh?

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:13.940
Daichi-san?

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.650
That's so cool, having your family cheer you on.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:49.840
I would hate it.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.410
Why?

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.960
Well, I actually understand how Tsukishima feels.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.410
Huh?

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.450
I'm not sure how to feel about having

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.120
the same opinion as Tanaka-san.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:00.160
Episode 17: "The Battle Without Will Power"

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.160
Next time on Haikyu!!: "The Battle Without Will Power."
