WEBVTT

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.650
Give it to me!

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.320
All... ...right!

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.000
Yes!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.290
Well done!

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.070
That was no ordinary prefectural qualifier match.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.760
I got goosebumps.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.600
All right! Let's do our greetings.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.470
Right!

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.040
Now we're at one loss, one win.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.600
Don't get on your high horse.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.210
I won't.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.930
Haikyu!!

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.630
Episode 25: "Declaration of War"

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.210
Thank you very much!

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.760
We did it, Sensei.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.440
Yes.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.730
It...

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.660
looked like he was actually able to predict where Hinata was going to hit.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.820
If it wasn't caught by the block, changing the course,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.280
That was a very heartwarming match.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.230
he might have picked it up.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.240
Karasuno           Aoba Johsai

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.410
Say what you will, but the results are what you see.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.780
There's no way your disappointment will subside.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.220
I'm sure there are even some plays you regret.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.550
With that in mind, let me just say something:

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.140
You fought well.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.440
Let's go greet the people in the stands.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.160
How can I be the ace when I couldn't even make that?!

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.130
Thank you very much!

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.010
Rule the Court Thank you very much!

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.780
Hey, hurry up!

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.490
Yeah!

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.430
We fell over!

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.300
You're way too worked up!

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.550
Hinata, you dumbass!

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.520
Don't ever forget this sight.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.840
We're definitely going to pay them back.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.560
Yeah!

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.770
Apparently we're about to head out.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.990
Yeah.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.390
Karasuno High School Volleyball Club Kageyama!

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.930
We're not gonna lose next time!

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.670
Apparently.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.240
Right.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.160
Hey!

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.620
You guys were awesome!

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.000
Yay!

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.830
Ne-san!
Ryu!

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.340
You did great, getting that last one!

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.230
You looked awesome!

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.570
Right...

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.430
Or rather, I appreciate the support, but don't use my name so much...

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.700
Don't be embarrassed!

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.740
Ow, ow, ow! Seriously, stop!

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.060
Hey, your boobs! Your boobs are in my face!

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.860
That was a great serve, Tadashi!

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.060
Thank you very much.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.520
What? You can't handle some boobs in your face?
The last one! The last spike was amazing!

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.280
Thanks!
Thanks.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.290
I couldn't help but remember our last match,

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.730
so when I saw the triple block, it was quite chilling...

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.240
Just like when Azumane faced the Iron Wall,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.280
Kageyama might have thought

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.250
it was best to think ahead and have Hinata's hand break through...

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.540
No... It might just have been instinct.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.430
It's so amazing that you got through such a high block!

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.480
That last part... When the Great King reacted...

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.430
I thought he was going to get it.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.890
The Great King really is amazing.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.700
When the bus comes, will you load our stuff?

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.650
I'm gonna go get everyone else.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.340
Right.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.870
This is a warning, Oikawa.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.130
Don't choose the wrong path again.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.690
You chose the wrong path.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.090
There was a place where you could have realized your true potential.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.100
Because of your worthless pride, you didn't choose it.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.950
So you're trying to tell me

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.260
that I should have gone to Shiratorizawa instead of Seijoh, right?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.270
No team is guaranteed victory.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.280
If nothing else, I can say...

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.700
...that my team is the strongest one here.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.160
Shiratorizawa Academy
Wow, I see you're still laughably confident!

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.720
Worthless pride, huh?

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.960
That's true...

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.940
Listen up, Ushijima.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.450
I never thought my decision was wrong,

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.660
and my volleyball hasn't ended at all.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.310
Don't you ever forget

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.460
my worthless pride.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.480
Oh, yeah.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.070
If you keep all of your attention on me,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.810
you're going to get stabbed from the direction you least expect.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.200
What's that supposed to mean?

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.660
My junior...

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.170
isn't smart, and isn't even close to my level yet...

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.880
But now that he's not by himself, he's strong.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.440
When crows flock, they might even kill a huge, white eagle.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.440
Hey.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.740
What the hell are you doing?

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.810
Hurry up and load your your stuff onto the bus.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.230
What's the matter, you two?

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.480
Infertile soil will not bring forth splendid fruit.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.460
I'll show you just how much we can grow from the concrete.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.380
Today's Events Ah, w-wait!

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.500
The Japanese National High School Volleyball Tournament Miyagi Prefecture Qualifiers (Boys) Finals Shiratorizawa vs. Karasuno

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:26.520
Haikyu!!

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.330
No surprise. They're fast asleep.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.380
You can't blame them.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.400
They fought two matches with powerful opponents.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.420
I'm thankful for you, Sensei.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.780
Wha?! Where did that come from?

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.580
The fact that a team like ours, which hadn't done well for a while,

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:54.030
got to do so many practice matches with the powerhouse schools from Tokyo...

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.830
All I can say about that is that we were blessed.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.050
You need someone else to become more disciplined.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.310
No matter how hard you try by yourself, there's a limit.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.190
The fact that we were able to regain our connection with Nekoma

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.660
is a much bigger deal than you or the team realizes.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.780
You did an amazing thing.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.780
What? No, I didn't...

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.940
If we're able to win tomorrow,

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.660
please make sure you compliment me then.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.000
Right.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.120
All right. Get your things and head straight to the gym for a meeting.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.760
Right... You totally drooled. Gross.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.710
My drool isn't gross!

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.430
Oh, they're back.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.810
Congrats on making it to the finals!

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.720
Oh, Michimiya.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.930
How did you know?

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.320
They just announced it on the school announcements.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.530
That's amazing!

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.340
The fact that you were able to beat Seijoh and made it to the finals is just... is just...

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.720
Amazing! It's insane!

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.580
Your lack of vocabulary is insane.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.360
Wait, what happened to your face?! That bruise!

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.790
Yeah... It happened at the match today...

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.170
It looks a lot worse than it actually feels.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.330
I see...

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.620
Hey, boys' volleyball team.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.200
That was amazing!

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.300
Congrats!

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.920
Hinata! Kageyama! Well done!

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.660
Sensei!
Thanks!

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.430
I'm going to cheer you on tomorrow!

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.440
You better win!

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.920
Do your best!

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.560
You guys all stayed late for us...

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.740
M-Sta Miyagi is gonna start!

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.170
Good day-evening.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.990
Good day-evening!

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.120
Today, the Sendai Municipal Gymnasium in Tomizawa

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.750
hosted the quarter and semifinals of the Miyagi prefectural qualifiers

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.090
for the National High School Volleyball Tournament,

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.350
otherwise known as the Spring Volleyball Tournament.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:38.380
Karasuno                                   Aoba Johsai

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.440
In the first match, Karasuno High School defeated

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.910
the powerhouse school, Aoba Johsai High School,

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.860
earning them a spot in the finals for the first time in years.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.360
Wow, that is certainly surprising.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.060
To think that Seijoh would be eliminated.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:35.120
Precisely. With Oikawa-kun at the lead, they are an extremely well-balanced team,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.380
so it's sad that we won't be seeing them in the finals.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.090
Come on! Show us a little more!

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.360
We actually won!

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.300
Yeah! Yeah!

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.380
Stop showing just Seijoh!

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.750
This happens every time.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.340
The lost in the semifinals. What do you expect?

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:56.810
Semifinals, Round 2 The Champions' Dignity

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.240
Next, we have the second round of the semifinals.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.340
In this match, the school garnering attention rightfully won,

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.560
and moved toward the finals.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.020
Now the headliner arrives.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.560
It would be Shiratorizawa Academy,

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.930
that has won this tournament the last three years,

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.200
but is led by Ushijima Wakatoshi, who has played for the under-19 national team.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:25.300
Shiratorizawa Academy           Kesenike West High School

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.970
Looks like they had no problems winning straight through the semifinals.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.580
Yes.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.510
This year, they've gathered members that might just promise them victory at Nationals.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.920
I think we can expect great things from them.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.510
It'll be interesting to see how high Karasuno can climb

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.720
against the powerful Shiratorizawa Academy.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.180
You can watch the finals live on this channel, tomorrow at 11 AM.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:43.150
Tomorrow: Volleyball Spring Tournament Finals: 11:00~ Live!

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.160
The match that will determine the Miyagi Prefecture representative...

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.700
Be sure not to miss it!

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.860
Now, then. We'll be going against Shiratorizawa tomorrow, but...

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.650
In the three years since Oikawa joined Aoba Johsai,

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.650
they have never beaten Shiratorizawa.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.900
Not even once.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.920
They are undoubtedly the undefeated champions.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.440
Of course, there's Ushijima,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.330
but there are plenty of others that are top in the prefecture.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.800
It's no fluke that they are top in the prefecture.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.720
Shiratorizawa is far stronger than you can even imagine.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.850
No one actually thinks we're going to win.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.400
Huh?

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.110
What is it, Hinata?

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.860
That doesn't matter!

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.280
I think... Hey, don't talk to the coach like that!

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.940
Oh, uh... I didn't mean it like that...

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.090
Just say it.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.120
R-Right.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.080
No one thought that we were going to beat Seijoh, either.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.320
That's why it doesn't matter...

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.030
I think.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.720
Tomorrow, we're going to be the challengers again.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.460
Let's turn the tables on them.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.400
Right!

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.730
"The fallen powerhouse." "The flightless crows."

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.130
There's no one to call you that anymore.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.860
Birds with the wind in their wings are flying across the great blue sky right now.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.760
And all of you should be able to make it!

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.400
To the highest limit,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.610
Karasuno High School Volleyball Club
to the farthest limit!

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.580
Now, everyone. The time has come!

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.920
Let's win tomorrow and make it to nationals!

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.750
Yeah!

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.260
All right. Now get home and go to bed so you aren't tired tomorrow.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.810
Right.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:31.880
All right, dismissed!

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.050
Right!

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:37.470
Kageyama.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.390
Throw me a toss.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.980
Huh? They couldn't be...

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.660
I knew it.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.070
Ah! Yachi-san!

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.510
Could you throw us some balls?

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.250
You guys had two matches today, so you should just go home and rest up.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.050
If I went home right now, I'd be too worked up to sleep.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.540
So, please!

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.770
Please!

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.210
Throw it, please!

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.460
Okay.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:22.560
Yeah!

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.360
Give me one more!

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.270
Yeah.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.460
One more!
Yeah.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.490
What's the matter, Yachi-san?

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.780
Oh! I-I'm sorry!

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.110
I just remembered something... What did you remember?

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.560
The time you two got into that fight,

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.070
I kept throwing balls to you like this.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.930
Really?

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.680
What?! You don't remember?!

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.700
Hinata like charged you and tried to fight with you,

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.290
and then Kageyama-kun started punching and pushed you over...

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.020
I was super scared!

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.240
O-Oh... Sorry.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.580
Oh, uh, that's not what I meant...

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.200
I thought of this, watching the match today.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.700
If I hadn't become a manager,

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.080
I wouldn't have been able to watch today's matches,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.660
wouldn't have been so excited and flustered,

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.710
or been so happy when you won,

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.110
and my heart wouldn't have felt so warm.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.460
It's all because I watched each of you work so hard

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.570
to do something that you couldn't do before...

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.160
If I hadn't been here, I would have never had that experience.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.540
So, thank you.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.320
No, no! We should be thanking you!

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.460
You stayed with us through all our practices!

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.970
If you weren't with us, Yachi-san, we might not have completed our new quick, either!

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.640
Really? I was of some use, even though I'm just a Townsperson B?

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.900
Of course!

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.040
You're the best Townsperson B in the Tohoku region!

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.100
Is that even a compliment?

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.520
Of course it is!

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.620
If you're actually thankful, too, you need to thank her!

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.540
Ah... Thanks.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.300
Is that all you can say?

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.330
There are so many other ways to say it!

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.850
Shut up! I thanked her, didn't I?

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.700
N-Now, now...

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.020
What are you doing?

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.760
Sh-Shimizu-senpai?!

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.990
Resting properly is another important part of preparing for matches, you know.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.990
S-Sorry!

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.490
Come on! That's enough!

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.370
Let's clean up!

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.380
What?

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.070
Come on, hurry up!

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.140
Okay...

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.120
We got in trouble because of you.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.280
You wanted to practice, too, didn't you?

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.110
I'm sorry for helping them practice.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.090
No, it's fine.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.720
Actually, thanks for practicing with them.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.720
Right!

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.630
Hitoka-chan, it's already dark, so do you want me to go to the bus stop with you?

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:12.680
O-Okay!

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.880
Hinata and Kageyama, as soon as you're done, you need to go straight home.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.830
Right!

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.980
I wonder how the Little Giant felt the day before the finals...

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.260
I'm super nervous,

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:40.950
but...

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.380
Isn't it even more exciting now?!

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.410
We're going to win tomorrow.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.260
Yeah!

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.410
But man... Who ever thought that Karasuno would make it to the finals?

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:23.980
They beat Seijoh,

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.090
so maybe they're becoming a powerhouse again.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.110
Hey, speaking of...

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.140
It's Ushiwaka.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.260
H-Hey!

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.850
Hinata Shoyo. Kageyama Tobio.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.420
We made it to the finals.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.190
We, who grew from the concrete,

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.720
will beat you and go to nationals!

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.910
I look forward to it.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.040
Let's meet on the court.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.500
Damn it...

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.020
I wanna hurry up and fight him!

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.640
All right! We're gonna make it to the spring tournament, no matter what!

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.600
Yeah!
