00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.390
You do realize that

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.780
you have finals next month, right?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.730
Right?

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.030
So, I think you know what I'm getting at,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.930
but if you fail any subjects...

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.370
Supplementary classes will be held on weekends.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.650
Sometimes, they may be held during summer vacation, too.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.340
Participating in club activities would prove quite difficult.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.000
Hey! There's nowhere to run!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.310
Ennoshita, catch them!

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.910
Got it!

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.580
Fail... Fail... What counts as a failing grade?

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.700
That's your question?

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.430
Kageyama's not breathing!

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.540
Since we said we were going to continue club activities,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.510
we have to at least make decent grades.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.320
You shouldn't fail.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.150
Nope.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.160
M-Maybe if we beg the vice principal...

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.620
Why don't you try really hard and not fail the exam?

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.480
Even if we get the vice principal's permission,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.330
if you have to take supplementary classes, those will take priority.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.120
Coach!

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.720
W-Well, this isn't something you're gonna be able to avoid as a student.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.770
But...

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710
You need willpower! You need to believe you can do it!

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.760
Mind over matter?!

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.360
No, that's fine.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.570
Please teach me!

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.480
Hinata, I didn't really want to bring this up,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.190
but do I look like someone who got good grades?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.780
Hinata, I'm sure you don't have to worry this much about it.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.550
I've never had a double-digit score on any of my quizzes.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.540
Will I still be okay?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.250
Huh?

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.250
Hey! Stop it with the bodhisattva faces, you two!

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.380
They can do it if they try. They can do it if they try...
Sensei, pull yourself together!

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.630
Ah, the sound of anguish.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.310
Get a hold of yourselves!

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.780
We still have time until exams start.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.310
There's no way Karasuno could bring our best without these four idiots!

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.920
Not a chance!

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.530
I don't know if I'm flattered or insulted...

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.480
We're gonna do this... We're all gonna go to Tokyo.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.840
Haikyu!!

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.200
Episode 2 Direct Sunlight Listen up, you guys.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.360
The one thing that you're going to promise me right now...

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.290
We're Gonna Go to the Spring Tournament!

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.880
...is that you will not fall asleep in class.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.290
That's the first priority?

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.810
Staying up late through sheer willpower.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.790
Screwing up in your classes and in club.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.180
It's all absolutely unreasonable!

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.220
Right...

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.400
We're heading out.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.700
R-Right. Good job.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.800
It'll be all right.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.570
I mean, you guys passed your high school entrance exams.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.270
Suga-san!

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.530
If you fall asleep in class, you'd better be prepared for the consequences.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.520
Kageyama.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.810
What? No!

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.520
You have no right to be picky!

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.960
We can't go to the away games if we fail!

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.010
It's Nekoma!

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.110
There's gonna be plenty of strong schools from Tokyo!

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.470
You're okay with not being able to go?!

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.860
You told Ushiwaka that you'd become the best setter!

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.960
I'm actually surprised that Kageyama's grades are bad.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.360
He seems pretty smart.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.560
Hinata's grades don't surprise me at all, though.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.600
I'm sure all that's in his head is volleyball.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.420
Tsukishima!

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.890
...san.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.780
Help us study... Please.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.820
What? No.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.060
Just, like, less than an hour each day!

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.630
Or tell us how to study...

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.710
It wouldn't hurt to do that a couple minutes before or after club.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.840
Hey, I don't think it's fair that you're having the shrimp

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.070
ask for the both of you.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.830
What do you have to say, big guy?

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.880
Kageyama, ask him!

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.670
Please teach us.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.210
What?

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.930
Please... teach us how to study.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.440
I don't think I quite heard you.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.790
Teach us how to study!

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.650
Hey!

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.700
Shut the hell up! You're disturbing the neighbors!

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.770
S-Sorry!

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.480
Why am I getting yelled at?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.560
Sorry.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.220
No, thanks anyway.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.550
Shimizu-senpai!

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.010
I found someone in another class that's not in a club yet.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.520
Thanks!

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.160
Yes, no!

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.060
"Yes, no"?

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.420
She smiled!

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.690
U-Um, doing a manager's job by yourself must be hard, right?

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.420
I'll do whatever I can as a first-year to help.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.410
We're Going to the Spring Tournament

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.410
We third-years are going to be gone after the next tournament.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.480
Watching all of you grow stronger,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.330
I thought again about what may happen next year and the year after that.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.790
I have to make sure I do my job properly.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.920
I-I'll help.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.120
Thanks, but you should focus on studying.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.570
That and practice of course.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.430
Everyone's counting on the ultimate bait.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.170
Right!

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.850
All right, let's get the next one over with.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.830
Hinata, what's the first answer to question 6?
For this, you do this...

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.120
Question six: Please insert the correct word or phrase that goes in the parentheses

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.160
to correctly complete the proverb.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.960
This proverb expresses that even ruthless people can show compassion and shed a tear.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.830
Even ogres can be moved to...

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.420
...an iron club?

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.890
Ow, my eyes!

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.070
Hey, how could you do that to the ogre?

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.400
You're thinking of another proverb.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.260
Did you not read the explanation?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.800
Oh, shut up.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.150
You probably saw the word "ogre," didn't read the rest of the question,

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.570
and just wrote the first thing that came to mind.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.120
You really are a simpleton.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.830
Yeah. You need to calm down.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.790
You're too careless.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.020
Why do you guys have to keep going?!

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.450
You're one to talk, Kageyama.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.430
Honestly, you're probably worse off than Hinata.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.470
You need to memorize English vocab words on your own.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.450
Japanese people can't understand English!

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.240
Then give up on going to Tokyo.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.100
Kageyama.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.110
B quick.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.210
A. C. Timed attack in front of the setter.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.420
Left-back attack.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.290
D. Side-by-side. Semi.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.860
Timed attack behind the setter.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.390
So fast...

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.850
How long did it take you to memorize those?

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.310
I think... less than a day?

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.080
Which is exactly why I'm not going to let you say you can't memorize those words.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560
O-Oh, no...

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.980
I-I'm not gonna lose to Kageyama!

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.910
All right. Let's go to my place after club on Saturday.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:33.720
Got it.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.040
I'm not gonna lose to them, either!

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.660
And I said you need to calm down...

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.670
Nishinoya, let me see your quiz from yesterday.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.340
Karasuno Volleyball Club Snacks!

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.040
In general,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.560
you can find the the answers for the Japanese questions in the passages given.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.300
So, if you just read them carefully...

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.920
Question 3: In the passage,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.810
identify the sentence that best reflects Norio's contradictory feelings.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.690
Live more like a man, Norio!!!
Question 4: Fill in (A) from the passage with the most appropriate word.
Live more like a man, Norio!

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.690
It tells you right here to find it in the passage!

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.950
Don't ignore both the question and Norio!

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.650
You're so awesome, Noya-san.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.780
You're good at memorization, aren't you, Nishinoya?

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.780
Leave the four-kanji idioms to me!

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.740
Tripod Headstand That won't be on the exam!

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.950
Ugh, are you guys actually studying?

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.570
Are you feeling okay?

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.170
What'd you mean by that?!

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.640
Heyo, Saeko-nesan!

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.880
Hey, Yu!

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.480
You're looking cool, as always.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.400
Thanks!

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.380
P-Pardon the intrusion... You're totally fine.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.630
Let's see... Want your big sis to teach you a thing or two?

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.070
Shut up!

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.640
You're just as dumb as me, so there's no point.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.850
Hey, don't you dare underestimate a college girl.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.960
You only go to your job and practice!

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.440
Sh-Shut up! I'm working hard when no one's looking!

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.780
Tanaka's sister is so cool.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.320
Yeah.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.980
Don't come crying to me later!

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.700
Practice? What kind?

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.500
For taiko.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.480
She's getting a team together.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.480
When it's festival time, she goes all out.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.530
Wow. How cool.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.340
Viva chest wraps!

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.200
All right, let's do this.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.450
You're going to Tokyo, aren't you?

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.550
Yes, Ennoshita-sensei!

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.930
Sender: Hinata Shoyo Tomorrow!!! Tokyo's starting their IH prelims tomorrow, right?! Do your best!
Tokyo's starting their IH prelims tomorrow, right?!

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.930
Do your best!

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.530
Yeah, gradually... You guys are coming over here, right?

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.400
Yeah, gradually...

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.530
You guys are coming over here, right?

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.920
Ni-chan, let's play jump rope!

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.680
Nat-chan, your brother's busy studying.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.750
Aw...

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.250
To: Kozume Kenma Subject: Totally!!!! We're totally going!!!! We're gonna win this time, just you wait!!!!

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.740
Message Sending All right! I'm gonna go to Tokyo!

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.700
Shoyo, be quiet!

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.700
Faculty Room Goodness, Tanaka from Class 1...

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.040
Not only is he not sleeping in class anymore,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.600
he's been asking questions after class.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.480
Same with Nishinoya from Class 3!

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.770
Looks they can do it if they try.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.020
Maybe the Tokyo away games are becoming a reality.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.190
That just leaves Shimizu-san...

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.700
I wonder if it's going well.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.700
Hey, do you have a moment?

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.700
Karasuno High School Boys' Volleyball Club Members and Manager Seeking Members!! Please Contact Shimizu Kiyoko in Class 3-2

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.580
Trying to find a new manager...

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:47.970
Haikyu!!

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.180
Wow... She's so pretty.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.800
Even at the Inter-High prelims,
So, she's a third-year...

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.120
She's so pretty.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.860
they were neck-and-neck with Aoba Johsai, who actually made it to the finals.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.370
The mole by her mouth is sexy, too.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:58.860
So pretty.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.020
Though we do have quite a few troublemakers,
Her hair is silky-smooth.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.160
but I'm sure you'll find that they're a team you want to root for.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.160
Everyone's totally staring at her, too.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.660
So, why don't we try a trial membership?

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.020
Huh?! Sure!

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.120
Really?! Thank you so much!

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.480
Then I'll come by again after school.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.920
So you found a new person!

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.520
What's up?
What's going on?

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.720
Um, she's joining the club on a trial basis as the new manager...

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.530
I-I'm Yachi Hitoka!

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.070
Seriously? That's awesome!

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.990
Nice job, Shimizu-senpai!

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.780
So cute...

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.480
You're a first-year?

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.490
I-I'm in Class 1-5, sir!

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:47.850
"Sir"?

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.610
Asahi, back up a bit.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:50.160
Huh?

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:53.960
Hey!

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.300
Don't stare like that! It's rude.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.300
Thank goodness.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.120
Now there'll be a manager next year, too.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:58.940
Yes!

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.800
Sh-She hasn't actually joined yet.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.030
I asked her suddenly today,

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.270
and before work with the membership committee,

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.830
so she's just dropping in to say hi today.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.640
I-It's a pleasure to meet you!

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.240
Same!

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.740
Could you not surround her until she's more comfortable?

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.890
S-Sorry for the intrusion.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.500
Shimizu.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.830
So you were looking for a new manager... Yeah.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.780
I didn't think we got enough response when we tried to find people in April.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.640
I thought it was important to find someone to carry on as manager,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.130
especially with Karasuno getting so much stronger.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.290
Shimizu-san!

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.170
Kiyoko-san!

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.600
I just came on a whim, but there were so many big guys!

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.340
What am I going to do tomorrow?

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.490
I stood next to that pretty lady for like two minutes...

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.140
What if her fans try to kill me?!

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.400
What's the matter?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.930
Blonde hair and pierced ears!

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.550
To think that he's a fan, too...

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.010
I-I'm gonna get killed!

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.410
What? Killed...

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.040
I'm starving.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.000
Year 1 Class 4
Let's go to Sakanoshita!

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.710
We agreed on just before and after club, right?

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.870
Right?

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.030
Well, the English teacher, Yoshida-sensei, was gone, so...

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.610
Please come back during business hours.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.890
Year 1 Class 4
Damn it, Tsukishima's so stingy... Stingyshima!

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.380
I have to do something... Hinata!

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.480
You're gonna teach me, Yamaguchi?

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.720
Sorry, I suck at English.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.240
Remember that girl who came yesterday as a manager candidate?

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.450
She said she was in Class 5,

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.070
so she might be good at studying.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.160
That's right.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.370
Classes 4 and 5 are advanced.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.760
What should I do after school?

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.800
Volleyball club, huh?

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.890
Yachi-san!

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.580
Pardon us.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.800
Huh? What?

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.340
They're from the volleyball club?!

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.360
What should I do? What do they want?

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.060
Did they introduce themselves to me yet?

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.560
Their names... What were their names?

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.810
To think that I can't remember names I've heard before...

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.090
You can't even remember names?!

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.610
Unable to make it in society, I lose my job...

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.690
Forced to wander the streets...

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.800
Maybe even sell my organs!

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.850
I'm Hinata Shoyo from Class 1!

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.440
This is Kageyama.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.370
Hey.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.720
H-Hey.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.120
Yachi-san, do you like studying?

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.830
I don't hate it.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.720
Could you teach me this English?

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.260
You should ask her, too, Kageyama!

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.990
Please teach us.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.990
If we fail any tests next month,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.800
we won't be able to go to the Tokyo away games,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.880
so we've been having the tall guy with glasses named Tsukishima help us...

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.460
Why can't you do this?

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.960
But lately, he's getting irritated because Kageyama and I are so stupid.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.790
I'm not scared of him.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.020
But it'd be better for someone to teach us nicely!

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.690
I-If I'm good enough... Really?!

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:08.480
Yeah.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:13.440
But I wonder if I'll be able to teach in a nicer way than the tall guy with glasses...

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.450
You definitely don't have to worry about that.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.910
Wow!

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.910
I see! Wow!

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.830
Oh, it's nothing...

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.360
Your notebook's really easy to look at, Yachi-san.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.130
You're great at drawing, too!

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.800
My mom works at a design firm,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.160
so she's always been picky about things like this.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.770
Oh, if you leave a space here, it'll be easier to fill in later.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.960
Also, if you limit the number of colors you use, it won't get confusing.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.000
And...

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.100
I'm sorry! I was writing all over your notebook!

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.700
Oh, I see... You're amazing!

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.600
I-It's n-nothing... nothing...

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.080
So, Hinata-kun... Just Hinata's fine.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.530
Do you not like studying, Hinata?

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.740
I hate it. Sitting for a long time like this sucks.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.420
So you're trying really hard so you can go to Tokyo?

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.520
Yeah! We're gonna have practice matches

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.950
with all the strong schools from Tokyo!

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.630
That's amazing.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.170
I've never been that serious about anything before.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.090
There's this school called Nekoma High School in Tokyo,

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:14.620
and the setter there is super-smart.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.650
And then like their leader has a really spikey head...

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.380
He's really big and seems like a bad guy.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.200
And there's a guy that's totally awesome

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.030
at picking up one receive after another like foom.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.890
The libero from Nekoma is awesome.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.040
He's on par with Nishinoya-san.
Setter?

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.250
There are a lot of amazing guys!
Spikey head? Libero?

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.070
Not just in Tokyo, but in our prefecture...
Are these positions?

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.280
There's the Great King from Aoba Johsai,

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.870
Ushiwaka, who's known as the undefeated champion,

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.560
and Date Tech has the Iron Wall who's 190 cm tall!

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.820
190 centimeters?!

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.020
Um... Hinata, are you a manager, too?

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.380
Why?

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.090
Oh... I thought only tall people played volleyball

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.810
and the club was full of tall guys.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.010
I may be short, b-but I'm a regular!

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.700
Oh, my goodness!

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.040
I can't believe I judged someone by their appearance!

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.320
I'm so sorry!

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.180
It's okay. I'm used to it.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.780
Even if I'm not big,

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.940
I can fly!

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.380
Hinata, don't you need to copy this down?

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.710
Oh, yeah.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.420
Everyone's so big and they look strong,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.960
but when we're in a match,

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.570
I feel like I'm taking those people on.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.710
It's exciting. It's nerve-racking.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.960
That's amazing, taking on people like that.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.380
That makes you a Little Giant, Hinata.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.110
Huh?!
What?!

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.830
You know who the Little Giant is?

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:39.640
Huh?

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.480
Uh, no. I, uh...

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.820
Don't you call Japanese players that when they're fighting

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:50.310
with much bigger foreign players in sports?

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.160
Oh, right.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.030
Yeah, I'm gonna be the Little Giant.

00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:00.000
Hey, Little Giant that's not gonna make it to Tokyo,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.490
hurry up and copy this.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:05.200
Year 1 Class 5

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.200
Will you help us study again?

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.410
Sure. Teaching you guys helps me remember the material, too.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.470
Thanks! Thank you, Yachi-san!
Oh, no, it's nothing...

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.760
See you in club!

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.780
What is this?

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.550
I feel like I've been left out in direct sunlight for a while.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.150
Yachi-san!

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.070
This afternoon's English quiz...

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.760
Some parts you taught me were on there,

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.360
and I got a third of them right!

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.530
Wahoo!

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.360
That's amazing, Hinata-kun!

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.700
Hinata's so good at communicating... Hinata's fine!

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.040
That's amazing, Hinata!

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.680
They're already buddies.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.600
So you'll be observing today.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.460
One, two, three, four... You don't have to be nervous.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.330
Five, six, seven, eight... Wight!

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.780
"Wight"?

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.540
Oh, but be careful of stray shots... Right!

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.300
Stray shots?

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.360
Could it be someone's trying to kill me?

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.100
Hey, you okay?

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.210
Th-The scary person from yesterday!

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.670
He's gonna kill me!

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:16.440
Um... I'm actually the coach...

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.510
Oh, my goodness!

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.120
I judged someone by their appearance again!

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.550
I'm so sorry!

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.610
Left!

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:28.960
All right!

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.040
Nice, Tanaka!

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.900
Don't open up the block space!

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.440
Right!

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.500
Next!

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.080
I'm sorry!

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.790
I need to hear you guys!
Left!

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.090
Two blocks!

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.600
Nice, Hinata!

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.040
Sorry!

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.160
Are you okay?

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.990
Uh, yes.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.480
This is my first time seeing volleyball outside of PE class so close.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.170
It's pretty amazing.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.090
I think our team's offense is among the best in the prefecture.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:57.550
Sorry!

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.480
Kiyoko-san's talking!

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.410
She's smiling!

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.790
Her lips are moving!

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.790
So that's what girl talk looks like.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.770
Stop goofing off, damn it!

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.020
Come on, next round!

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.370
Karasuno was actually strong enough to go to nationals before.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.040
Right!

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.210
Nationals?

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.980
But in the last few years,

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.220
we've been called "the fallen giant" and "the flightless bird."

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.010
This time, we're going

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.890
to stand on the national stage.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.930
That's amazing...

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.510
So amazing!

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.420
Totally different from me.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:40.760
Fall in.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.490
So, this is rather sudden,

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:49.570
but Ouginishi High School requested a practice match tomorrow, and I accepted.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.030
They saw us at the Inter-High prelims and insisted.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.170
Don't forget the frustration and bitterness you felt losing to Seijoh.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.500
However,

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.350
you don't need to hold onto the feeling of losing.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.960
Hurry up and wipe that away!

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.420
Yeah!

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.480
I wonder if Ouginishi is strong.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.920
It doesn't matter who they are.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.750
All right. Let's do this!

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.760
Kiyoko-san has sure changed since that first-year girl showed up!

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.840
Yeah! It must have been hard to talk, surrounded by all us guys!

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.160
We need to work on our girl power from now on, too, Noyacchi!

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.160
You got it, Ryu-tan!

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.830
If you talk like that, I'm never speaking to you.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:00.960
Episode 3: Townsperson B

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.540
Next time on Haikyu!!: "Townsperson B."
