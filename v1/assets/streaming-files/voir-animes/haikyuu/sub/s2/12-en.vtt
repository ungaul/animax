The Japanese National High School Volleyball Tournament

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.760
Can I get a copy?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.320
Yes.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:21.870
Go, go, Tebaichi! Push it, push it, Tebaichi!

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.070
That's them. You know, Karasuno.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.870
Karasuno?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670
They're the ones that played a full set with Aoba Johsai at the Inter-High prelims

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.810
and actually almost beat them.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.590
Whoa, seriously?

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.750
Apparently, Kitagawa Daiichi's King of the Court is on that team.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.430
When does the judging start?

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.440
Apparently Chidoriyama Junior High's Nishinoya is also there, too.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.670
Probably the next one, since we don't have a match this round.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.560
The guy who was called the best libero when we were in junior high?

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.970
Yeah. But other than the libero,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.490
I think there was one other guy who kept receiving Oikawa's serves.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.770
I think it's their captain.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.960
But the members of Karasuno don't really seem that tall, do they?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.620
I'm pretty sure one of them is close to 190 cm,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.370
though I don't think he stood out much during the Inter-High prelims.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.950
Not to mention, their two lefts are pretty scary.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.950
They look like power spikers.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.620
And most importantly...

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.800
Their manager's cute.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.880
I'm sorry that you have to cheer from up above, Hitoka-chan.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.880
Or rather, she's hot. Or rather, she's sexy!

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.960
Also, there's that one guy...

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.790
The tiny middle blocker that hits those crazy quicks...

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.370
Karasuno's #10!

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.390
Whoa, what the heck? He looks like he's skin and bones!

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.320
H-Hinata, are you okay?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.280
Yep, I'm fine.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.220
I threw up on the way here, so I feel better.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.650
Of course you'd feel sick after eating all those pork bowls for breakfast.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.370
It's normal to eat pork cutlets on game days!

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.920
And by "normal," you mean...

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.240
You dumbass! Hinata, you stupid dumbass!

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.100
Kageyama's insult vocabulary is limited to "dumbass."

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.700
I-I'll do my best to widen my vocabulary!

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.620
I have that one thing you can drink!

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.560
I-I feel like I'm going to puke, too, after remembering Hinata puking...

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.220
Oh, thanks!

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.220
Huh?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.870
Go to the bathroom, already!

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.780
M-My nerves are getting to me, too...

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.470
I thought you were busy concentrating, but you were actually trying not to puke?!

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.460
Shoyo, is this seriously the second time you threw up on the bus?

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.490
You were able to actually hold it in until the bus stopped,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.840
instead of puking on someone's crotch.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.690
You've really grown up, Hinata.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.150
Is that really the team that almost beat Seijoh?

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.230
Shoyo!

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.380
Haikyu!!

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.250
Karasuno Tebaichi Ohgi Minami

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.710
Episode 12: "Let the Games Begin!"
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom!

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.430
The time to pee has come!

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.030
Bathroom, bathroom... Ow. Oh, I'm sorry...

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.590
The hell are you looking?!

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.910
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.590
He's from...

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.760
Ohgi Minami?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.640
That's the team we're playing first.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.120
They won their first match already.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.230
Hm? Oh, you're just a junior high kid.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.090
Huh?

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.260
Hey, sorry for yelling at you.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.520
You here to cheer your big brother on, or something?

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.320
My little brother loves that T-shirt, too.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.280
I... I'm first-year at Karasuno High School, Hinata Shoyo.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.200
We're going to win, and go to nationals!

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.620
What? Karasuno?

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.410
Don't make going to nationals sound so easy.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.440
Huh? But I mean it.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.120
Shut up, you little—

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.220
I'm gonna beat everyone, and go to Tokyo.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.200
Even if you were somehow lucky enough to keep winning,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.390
everyone just gets crushed by Shiratorizawa in the end.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.300
Huh?

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.870
Let's at least make some good memories.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.150
Higashida

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.250
The previous match is over.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.860
Let's go!

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.330
Yeah!

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.830
Fly Shut up, morons.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.360
Looks like Ohgi Minami's a team full of punks.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.830
Did that really come out of your mouth?

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.300
Stop making that face.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.050
Nice kill!

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.880
Your shaved head is seriously lame.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.760
Seriously, like seriously, seriously...

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.810
I'm going forth. Let us play a good game.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.770
Take this, damn it!

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.270
Put Your Heart Into It Nice kill!

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.080
Thank you for that opportunity.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.410
Nice kill!

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.370
Power at Full Throttle! Pick Up the Ball and Win!

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.230
Nice kill!

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.220
Everyone on Karasuno has really high attack power.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.370
Ohgi Minami         Karasuno

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.590
Fly

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.300
The spring tournament... Karasuno's battle...

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.450
Let's play!

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.310
...is about to start!

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:34.910
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Kaji!

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.480
Listen up.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.340
All of their third-years are already gone,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.670
but their power has always been with their second-years.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.840
They also just won straight through the first round.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.060
Don't let your guard down!

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.040
Make sure you're especially cautious of their #1 on the left!

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.950
Right!

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.420
Since the Inter-High prelims ended,

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.910
you've taken on unfamiliar challenges and you haven't been in sync.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.820
On top of that, you've lost about seventy practice games

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.690
against the powerhouse schools from Kanto.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:46.340
But your new weapons that kept failing at first are finally starting to take shape.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.300
Please get a win that makes up for all of the frustration you felt.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.300
There is No Victory Without Effort One Heart Right!
All right!

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.340
Karasuno, fight!

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.810
Yeah... Yeah!

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.140
Oh? So you came to watch the game, too,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.540
Ukai-sensei?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.980
Yeah.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.280
I guess that is your precious grandson's team.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.620
That's got nothing to do with it!

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.430
Ukai? Grandson?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.460
You're from Karasuno, too, right?

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.160
What are you doing up here?

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.480
Th-There's only one manager allowed on the bench.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.700
You didn't know that?

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.450
Oh.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.760
Ah, there's Sho-chan!

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.960
I actually just saw them play the other day, Oh, yeah!

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.480
but they have an intense first-year duo.
Sho-chan? Oh, you mean Hinata.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.420
Karasuno might actually make it pretty far this year.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.960
There's no match that you can't win,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.030
and there's no match that you'll win for sure.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.830
You can feel a little off, nervous, or panic...

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.790
No matter how strong the school, their team members are human.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.190
Even the slightest thing can trip someone up.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.900
Now... let's see how Karasuno will do today.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.980
Asahi-san, nice serve!

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.560
All right!

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.460
Yay! That was amazing!
Starting with a no-touch ace.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.750
Not bad.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.500
All right...

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:12.800
Let's go!

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.680
Ohgi Minami           Karasuno

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.900
He changed it up to a tip.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.140
Daichi-san, nice!

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.360
S-So fast! It's like he was waiting for it!

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.350
I feel like I can see the spiker's movements better than before.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.290
Asahi-san!

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.720
Ever since the first round,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.670
Ougi Minami hasn't been doing quicks any time the receives were a bit off.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.680
Left.
Tazawa-san!

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.840
All right!

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.970
Nice, Tsukishima!
How do I put this...

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.390
It seems like everyone is hesitating less in their movements.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.180
It wasn't like they were just practicing their new moves at the training camp.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.640
They had plenty of practice against All right!

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.100
powerhouse schools that were all completely different.
Nice receive!

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.270
The power behind their serves and spikes...

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.930
the diversity in their attacks... their defense...

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.720
Basically anything high-level...

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.170
They've gotten used to it...

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.630
Far more than before.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.200
All right!

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.200
Damn it...

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.210
All right!

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:30.960
Nice, Kageyama!
Another service ace!

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.960
Thanks!

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.720
Now it's a set point.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.170
Ohgi Minami

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.430
To think that we ended up against a team this strong so early on again...

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.420
Shiratorizawa!

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.270
Shiratorizawa!

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.480
Shiratorizawa                Ohgi Minami

00:09:49.270 --> 00:10:04.040
Ushijima! Ushijima!

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.570
Come on! We still have a chance!

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.400
Let's get hyped up!

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.000
Where's your usual enthusiasm?!

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.480
Yeah, that right there! Bring that enthusiasm!

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.310
The captain's voice was all raspy Let's get one!

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.500
because he was trying to talk over Shiratorizawa's cheers.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.590
It's up! Towada!

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.390
Even if I went after it, I wouldn't be able to reach it.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.710
Even if I could reach it,

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.640
there's no guarantee that someone would connect next and be able to score.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.090
Even if it did connect, it'd only get us one measly point.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.840
There's no point going after it...

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.730
Ohgi Minami High School

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.940
Hey, don't look so glum!

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.420
You guys look even scarier.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.360
You guys were seriously some problem children,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.020
but if you guys weren't here,

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.890
we wouldn't have been able to have any matches.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.630
So thanks.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.860
You guys have the bodies and sense for this, so keep doing your best!

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.720
All right!
Ohgi Minami         Karasuno

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.840
Yay!

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.880
Sho-chan, that was awesome! He jumped sideways!

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.590
Damn...

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.130
I'm gonna beat everyone, and go to Tokyo.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.510
So he wasn't just trying to sound tough back there...

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.560
He really means that he's going to try to do that.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.040
With that tiny little body, he's going to try to defeat Ushiwaka.
All right!

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.300
Ohgi Minami L-Let's keep doing our best!

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.760
Winning or losing doesn't matter.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.450
What's more important is that you guys do your best.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.070
Hey! Damn it!

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.410
Don't get all quiet!

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.370
C-Captain Akki-kun!

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.040
You guys are so tough when it comes to fighting,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.640
but why is it you get so weak when it comes to volleyball?

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.840
Weak?!

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.410
I-It doesn't matter how strong you are.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.990
I'm on the second floor, so I'm not scared!

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.800
Why did he even come?

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.790
You guys get just a little pushback, and then you give up.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.060
That's what I mean by weak.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.680
This is your fight, so how you handle it is up to you guys.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.530
But let me just say this...

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.990
Being serious, giving your all, and doing your best...

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.240
None of that's lame!

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.370
What the? Scary... Senpai, did you lose your mind?

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.640
Sensei!
Yes?

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.420
You know, since we came here to fight each other on the opposite sides of the net,

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.010
I don't think we have any other option than to win and continue on.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.240
Trying to act tough and worrying more about how we look

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.430
is pretty lame.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.990
Towada... All right, I'm gonna say it.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.880
What?

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.840
We're going to beat Karasuno!

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.520
We're gonna get through the prelims!

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.240
We're going to fight Shiratorizawa!

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.530
All right!

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.320
You actually just said that!

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.990
Well said, big mouth!

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.370
So we're gonna try to beat Shiratorizawa?

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.210
Bring it on, then!

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.090
We're seriously going to win, guys!

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.720
Yeah!

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.050
Challenge accepted!

00:13:48.550 --> 00:14:02.520
Haikyu!!

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.240
Fly

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.280
All right!

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.410
Karasuno Ohgi Minami Yeah!

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.730
Yay!
Nice, Hinata!

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.010
He did it again!

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.120
That first-year duo really is something.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:14.790
Yeah.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.710
But the second and third-years are far beyond my expectations, too.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.910
Right now, Karasuno is on the brink of revival,

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.580
thanks in great part to their passionate advisor and newfound strength.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.120
But that's all because they have a sturdy foundation.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.100
Foundation?

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:39.140
Last year, just for a short time, I came to see a practice at Karasuno.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.270
At the time, they had the ability and dedication.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.280
However, I felt a lack a confidence in them.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.530
It's like they were subconsciously used to losing.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.250
They don't look like that now.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.040
When the current third-years came to Karasuno,

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:04.000
Monthly Volleyball

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.560
it was right around the time where Karasuno being a powerhouse school

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.000
became a thing of the past.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.110
I'm sure the gap between their expectations and reality was pretty big.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.450
They were probably around during the worst time.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.890
That's exactly why...

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.520
The ones who didn't rot and didn't give up,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.830
and are still here now, have an unwavering strength.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.550
Daichi-san, nice receive!

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.980
All right!
Amazing! So amazing!

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.910
Karasuno        Ohgi Minami
Whoa. There's a 10-point difference.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.720
All right, let's keep this up to the end!
Damn it, they're strong.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.600
Yeah!

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.740
W-We still have a chance! Keep it up!

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.840
One more, Kageyama!

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.250
All right!

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.410
Kageyama's serves are sharp as hell.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.170
Yeah.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.430
Karasuno              Ohgi Minami
And now we're at match point.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.010
Every single time... We get cornered on the court,

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.390
and I always regret how much we didn't practice.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.820
One more, Kageyama! Nice serve!

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.400
It looks like Karasuno and Ougi Minami's match

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.290
is gonna end faster than I thought, so let's get ready for the next match.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.830
Yeah. Games sure go fast when there's such a difference in ability.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.030
It's not over yet! Don't give up!

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.550
I might just make it...

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.340
Or will I not?

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.340
Well, we're still second-years,

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.470
so I guess we'll have next year...

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.980
And that's why you never get any stronger, damn it!

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.030
Connect and finish it!

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.490
Damn it!

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.910
Tanaka-san!

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.070
It's not over yet!

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.000
Give me the last one!

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.640
I definitely underestimated him.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.180
I thought it was stupid for him to think he'd make it to nationals.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.920
I'm...

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.060
a fool.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.200
All right!

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.750
Yay? Did we win?
All right!

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.900
We won!

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.910
So cool!

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.410
All right!

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.870
They made it through their first set.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.740
Karasuno Ohgi Minami Thank you very much!

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.430
Ohgi Minami

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.600
Great job! You guys fought until the end!

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.090
Yeah.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.930
Just so you know, frustration is the right thing to be feeling right now.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.040
No matter what the fight is,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.030
when you lose, it's only natural to be frustrated.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.990
I'd go as far as saying even guys who don't practice much

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.000
probably feel frustrated when they lose a game.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.520
I think frustration is real for anyone.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:33.930
But...

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.930
Those who forget that frustration after three days will always be weak.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.450
If you waste time

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.250
during your three years in high school, time will completely fly by.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.140
Don't you dare forget the frustration you're feeling right now!

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.930
W-Well, see ya.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.150
I'll come see you guys next year, too, so do your best!

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.000
Captain!

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.330
Th-Thank you very much!

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.250
Thanks!

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.480
#4! #4!

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.720
Nice receive!

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.240
This seriously messes with your depth perception.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.990
I just stood next to him in the hallway and he was huge!

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.500
Well, yeah! He's two meters tall!

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.070
That's creepy!

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.770
It's a weapon... His height is a weapon...

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.830
Tanaka looks good with a banana.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.750
Nishida              Kakugawa

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.230
Thank you very much!

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.970
I guess we know who we're playing next.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:11.890
Karasuno Tebaichi Ohgi Minami Nishida Kakugawa

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.960
If we win the next game, we'll get through the prelims

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.240
and continue on to the qualifiers in October.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.600
No Shoes Allowed
We're gonna get through no matter what!

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.600
Yeah!

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.680
So it really is over just by losing once...

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.070
And yet...

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.340
That guy is two meters!

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.260
Two meters is super huge!

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.890
201 centimeters and 162 centimeters, huh...

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.420
I'm 163 if you round up!

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.250
201 centimeters and 162 centimeters...

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.280
There's a 40 centimeter difference.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.170
Listen!

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.950
F-Forty centimeters is the same size as Ketty-chan.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.310
That's not that big!

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.640
Is that an attempt to cheer him up?

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.090
Tekachu is also 40 centimeters.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.800
Note: Fujikujira sounds like a type of whale.
So is a fujikujira.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.600
F-Fujikujira?

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.210
What's that?

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.220
It's a kind of shark.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.840
Oh... You're so smart, Tsukki!

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:05.200
Fly I... want to combine with that shark.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.990
What?

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.720
If I combined with a fujikujira, I'd be two meters tall...

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.540
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.500
Are you really scared?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.420
Huh?

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.060
Let's go!

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.000
All right!

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.290
H-He really seemed to want to combine with that Etmopterus lucifer,

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.730
but I wonder if Hinata will be okay... Oh, yeah...

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.360
I'm sure he'll be fine even if he's like that before a match.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.830
R-Right?!

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.140
Well, it's finally about to start.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.100
But they're going up against someone that big.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.620
No, no. That has nothing to do with how Karasuno is right now.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.090
Right, Ukai-sensei?

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.760
Well, who knows?

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:49.780
Wha... Fly

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.900
High school boys haven't finished growing yet,

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.780
and their plays aren't complete.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.370
That's why a match can be decided

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:57.040
just by how tall someone is or if a team has an amazing ace.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.290
Hurry up, Hinata.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.620
B-But... R-Right!

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.960
Height, by itself, is a weapon in its own right.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.430
Seeing how Karasuno will deal with it...

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.910
Let's go.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.180
Right!

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.280
...will definitely be worth watching.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.300
So a fujikujira is a kind of shark, huh?

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.680
There are a lot of fish with confusing names.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.050
For example, a kinmedai might sound like it's related to sea bream, but it's a tropical fish.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.050
You really know a lot about fish, Tsukki.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:55.980
Shut up, Yamaguchi.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.040
Sorry, Tsukki!

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.500
