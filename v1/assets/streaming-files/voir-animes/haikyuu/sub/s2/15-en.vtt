00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.440
We'll be serving first.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.190
All right.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.290
It's finally the qualifiers.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.530
Everyone looks more nervous than usual.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.200
Those are so awesome!

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.170
Your new glasses look so cool, Tsukishima!

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.130
You've been saying that nearly every day, Hinata.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.880
Having you say they're cool shakes my self-confidence, so I wish you'd stop.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.630
What'd you say?!

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.340
Ta-da! Here you go.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.190
They're sports glasses.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.120
I made sure to find cool-looking ones.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.000
With those on, blocking with your face isn't scary at all!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.310
Uh, yes it is.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.020
I don't care if it's Ushiwaka or Benkei... Go stop 'em.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.220
What's up with the first-years putting on braver faces than us?

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.410
The third-years can't just sit here cowering, either.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.990
All right!

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.470

We're finally at the qualifiers.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.170
Our first opponent was a semifinalist at the Inter-High prelims.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.990
We've got our work cut out for us.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.200
You better go all out on that first one, Azumane!

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.410
Karasuno, fight!

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.870
Yeah!

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.080
Asahi-san, nice serve!

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.290
Make sure you guys get that ball!

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.380

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.780
Nice hit!

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.320
A hit like that from the end line?

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.270
Not to mention, while he was turning around?

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.100
That would usually be returned with an underhand hit.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.200

Heave ho! Heave ho!

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.340
It feels like...

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.010
...we're playing against some super-talented baseball team in gym class.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.490
Yeah... Their plays aren't exactly cookie-cutter,

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.370
so we can't seem to read what they're gonna do.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.550
So, the question is whether they're doing that on purpose or not.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.980
Unpredictability is normal for Johzenji, and that's their weapon.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.170
One more!

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.450
Come on, now!

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.210
Sorry!

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.940
Don't mind! Don't mind!

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.680
Pick up the ball, and hit it back!

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.730
Jeez... They get out of hand so quickly.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.540
You're the only third-year left.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.750
Those guys must be a handful.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.300
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.920
A quick!

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.820
This shouldn't be a surprise, but I guess they can attack normally, too.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.530
Karasuno

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.040
Lucky! It got over the net.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.500
Damn it!

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.240
Nice reaction!

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.840
But I don't know if they'll be able to connect.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.090
Nice, Hinata!

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.710
Whoa, he jumped!

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.090
L-Look out!

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.620
H-He's Spider-Man!

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.870
In the back!

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.440
He managed to return it!

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.150
We also have some guys on our team

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.170
who are skilled and unpredictable.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.620
Yeah!

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.430
Well, that was definitely surprising,

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.580
but Karasuno hasn't even done their ridiculous attack yet.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.460
Go! Killer serve!

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.690
Regardless of how the receive looks,

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.760
as long as it goes up, they can do whatever they need to.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.970
That's what they all think, and that's what they're able to do.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.020
Damn it!

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.640
One more! Hit it direct, Numajiri!

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.840
All right!

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.360
Karasuno hasn't gotten one actual attack in yet.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.690
Daichi-san, nice receive!

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.710
There it is!

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.240
#10's super quick!

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.990
Hey, Kageyama! We can't just sit here losing.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.210
So that was the quick I heard about. So cool!
Ow!

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.840
Their moves are hard to read,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.900
but it's not like the ball's gonna disappear.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.920
Let's just calm down and keep going.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.870
Yeah!

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.380
Well done.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.810
Karasuno Johzenji #10! #10!

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.640
All right!

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.070
Johzenji's so unrefined about everything.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.170
Their blockers just keep jumping, and they fall for feints a lot.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.740
And yet I wonder what makes them so persistent and hard to play against.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.700
I have a friend on the Johzenji basketball team.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.600
Really?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.160
Apparently their volleyball team mostly practices

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.460
with two-on-two games.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.880
Two-on-two games?

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.370
That's rough!

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.020
They're used to that,

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.920
so they don't really feel like anyone will get the ball for them,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.590
and all of them are constantly trying to attack.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.800
Cover!
Leave it to me!

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.260
You idiots! Be willing to give up the ball a little!

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.500
And that's probably why that happens...

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.610
They're all annoying.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.940
People from other schools think you guys are annoying, too.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.480
Huh?!

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.190
Tanaka-san!

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.420
Whoa!

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.880
Nice, Jiri!

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.040
Right now, Johzenji has two attackers up front, not counting their setter.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.830
Other than that, there's a chance of a back attack.
Let me hit, too!

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.750
He's the setter, isn't he? Who's going to set?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.830
The guy on the back line is going to set?

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.880
What?!

Karasuno                        Johzenji

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.360
Despite everything, I must say their volleyball is fun to watch.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.890
I can't argue with that.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.760
But in regards to freewheeling attacks,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.230
we're not so bad ourselves.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.100
Let's have some fun and play.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.490
They go all out and play around.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.700
In a match... Huh?

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.910
In order to fully enjoy a match, you need strength.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.430
Apparently, the former Coach Ukai said that a lot.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.420
I didn't really know what he meant about enjoying it, but...

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.670
All right!

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.840
Watching Johzenji, I think it might be something like this.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.560
The strength... to enjoy.
Nice receive!

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.000
It might because they're playing against Karasuno,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.400
but they're playing around more than usual.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.020
Yes. They really do play a good game when they get into it.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.790
Sorry! Sorry!

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.980
And that happens as soon as I compliment them.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.650
Karasuno                        Johzenji

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.650
All right!

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.010
He's got such a stern face,

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.920
but that setter sure does some crazy attacks.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.460
Karasuno Johzenji Nice receive!

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.880

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.460
Nice, Tsucchi!
Who's going to hit it?

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.720

All right!

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.650
That... wasn't a block...

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.600
That was his face.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:12.590

Kageyama, don't die!

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.000
He's not dying...

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.510
Hey, we're switching you out until your nose stops bleeding.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.510
My nose isn't bleeding!

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.470
It is. Why would you lie about that?

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.240
Are your eyes okay?
They're fine.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.860
Did he got caught up in the excitement of the other team?

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.650
Well, it's a good chance for you to cool your head.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.600
You can't go back out there until your nose stops bleeding,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.720
so go have it checked.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.120
Just in case!

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.560
Come on. Let's go.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.630
Hey, Kageyama!

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.580
I'll handle things while you're gone.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.790
Yup. Leave everything to your senpais.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.250
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:06.790
Huh? Karasuno... Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho!

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.260
I wonder why they're switching out their #10.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.780
He seems to be doing fine.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.650
I think they're going to use this opportunity to try other things.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.020
Not to mention,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.940
I think the other players are better at basic plays.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.880
What? Isn't that the truth?

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.120
At the Inter-High prelims,

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.300
Aone and Karasuno's #10 ended up becoming friends, oddly enough.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.830
That might be true for now.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.860
Huh?

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.080
Aone just spoke?

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.840
And their #10

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.300
is aware of that.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.360
Hinata.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.600
These past few months,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.220
Narita's spent quite some time paired with Sugawara as setter.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.000
Just watch your senpais play from here.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.690
Right.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.690
Let's do this in one shot!

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.630
You got this, Narita!

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.450
Calm down a little.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.210
I understand you want to play, but...

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.930
I wanna play and I wanna practice.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.410
I have a lot to do.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.870
All right!

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.090
Nice kill!
That's it! That's it!

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.370
Right.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.290
Karasuno                       Johzenji

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.570
Terushima, nice serve!

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.480
All right!

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.430
Whoo! Service ace! Whoo!

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.430
That guy acts like he just scored three points! It seriously pisses me off.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.780
You're one to talk, Tanaka.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.280
What?!

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.150
Don't let their excitement overwhelm you.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.880
We're gonna finish up this set!

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.840
Don't mind! Don't mind!

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.530
Get one through!

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.280
Kageyama's back.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.150
Kageyama-kun's okay.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.800
Yeah, seems like it.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.500
Good job.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.470
You okay?

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.960
But it doesn't seem like they're going to switch out yet.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.100
Yes.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.010
Nishinoya!
Got it!

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.600
Nice receive!

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.020
Didn't you say you'd handle things?

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.920
Shut up!

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.380
I'll eventually be able to do that...

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.820
Eventually.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:11.640
Nice kill!

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.920
Nice kill!
Nice!

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.350
We're not gonna lose...

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.540
Karasuno Johzenji Chance ball!

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.480
Got it!

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.860
Synchronized attack: Sugawara version!

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.130
All right!

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.320
Now they're at...

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.500
Karasuno Johzenji Set point.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.090
That thing where they all move at once...

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.710
That's so cool!

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.640
Hey, so, like...

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.380
Don't tell me they're...

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.660
Narita, one more! Nice serve!

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.840
Johzenji's also doing a synchronized play?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.680
All right!

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:08.910
Karasuno Johzenji We did that a lot, too...

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.420
Not bad, Narita.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.450
We still do, from time to time.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.850
Johzenji's synchronized attack just now

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.630
was most likely monkey see, monkey do.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.280
They just did it on a whim.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.160
What? But that'd put them at a disadvantage...

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.170
Not to mention, it was a set point.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.240
It probably also has to do with the fact

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.670
I totally thought I could do it!

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.670
that we're in our first set,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.670
but their recklessness is scary.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.100
I've been wondering about this, but...

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.480
Johzenji High School's banner...

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.180
Simplicity and Fortitude Johzenji Parents' Association

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.680
How do I put this?

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.180
It doesn't really fit the team... Does it?

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.810
I'd say they're more "wild and free."

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.370
Actually a long time ago, or rather, up until recently,

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.840
simplicity and fortitude described Johzenji's team accurately.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.740
You guys seriously need to think about when to do things.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.290
I totally thought I could do it.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.680
Now they got a set from us!

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.670
Just like you guys, they're a pretty troublesome team if you get them riled up.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.040
That #10 sure jumps well.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.100
Well, I mean, their motto is... Fly "Fly!"

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.340
And yet, we get that.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.470
Simplicity and Fortitude Johzenji Parents' Association

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.960
Our banner is so lame.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.010
Let's hurry and get a new one.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.240
"Simplicity and Fortitude" is cool, too!

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.190
I guess that depends on taste,

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.530
but it doesn't fit the team.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.620
At least our generation.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.900
Or rather, it won't fit the future generations, either.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.320
I know, right?

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.570
Miyagi Prefecture Johzenji High School

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.370
I'm Anabara, and I'm gonna be your coach starting this year.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.330
I'm going to rebuild this team from the ground up.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.270
First, you'll get better at playing two-on-two.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.890
That team apparently has five second-years.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.920
Seriously? And they got into the semifinals? That's awesome.
Yahoo!

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.240
Terushima!

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.090
Huh?

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.600
Eventually, there will come a time that's not fun.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.310
What are you going to do then?

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.940
Even then,

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.060
I'll do my best to have fun.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.440
We're gonna fool around even more!

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.400
Yeah!

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.110
Johzenji                       Karasuno

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.820
Man...

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.780
That weird duo's coming back?

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.500
Hinata, Kageyama, stay calm.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.960
Shut up, jeez.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.660
Looks like you're back, Mini Spider-Man.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.810
It's boring without your attacks!

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:30.560
Boring?

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.490
Like your captain.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.280
He may be good, but he's boring.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.510
Right... Though I don't really understand.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.570
Anyway, we're gonna have tons of fun and win this next one.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.230
I can't beat you one-on-one, though, Mr. Close-Cropped Hair...

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.190
Hey, don't give me a weird nickname!

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.370
Got it. I'll be more careful.
But if these guys are with me, I'm not gonna lose!
Thanks.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.440
Please.
Leave it to me!

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.720
Fly Higashi, nice serve!

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:54.820
Nishinoya!

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.860
Got it!

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.400
Ah!

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.540
I warned you guys!

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.820
Wow! Those are some amazing reflexes!

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.160
Actually, I think he was expecting that.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.630
Huh?

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.750
Daichi-san, nice job covering their asses!

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.340
Don't say it like that!

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:18.640
Here!

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.020
He's going for another insane hit!

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.330
All right!

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.780
We got it this time!

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.440
I-I'm sorry! Nice cover!

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.440
Thanks!

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.960
No matter how much you were told to calm down,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.160
I figured you guys might do something like that right when you got back,

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.410
because you would get too excited.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.960
I can't do any fancy plays,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.630
but I can give you guys a solid foundation.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.250
Well, go all out.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:58.870
Thanks!

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.350
Well, in the terms of wild and free,

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.700
it's not guaranteed that Johzenji would beat us.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.280
But...

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.400
That's not all that we have.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.630
Fly

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.320
Johzenji Karasuno All right!

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.700
The point difference is getting bigger.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.710
Let's get hyped up!

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.910
Yeah!

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:23.800
Damn it!

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.540
It's up. Get the last!

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.140
Get back!

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.210
Tanaka, nice!

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.640
All right!

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.800
Counter!

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.420
Yeah!

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.400
Damn it.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.720
We can't handle that #10.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.470
Hinata, nice kill!

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.520
Thanks!

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.980
I-I'm sorry!

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.110
Johzenji                        Karasuno

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.110
Don't worry about it.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.400
We're gonna end this.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.460
Out!

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.710
Don't mind! Don't mind!

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.030
Daichi-san, nice serve!

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.710
Got it!

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.580
Sorry!

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.230
Why you...

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.090
Is he going to do a dump attack?

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.550
Yeah, you go!

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.710
Crap... All right!

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.600
The other team called a time out!

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.490
All right!
It's good to be on the offensive,

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.930
but Johzenji is definitely panicking.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.390
Let's get more hyped up!

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.680
Yeah! Hyped! Super hyped!

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.620
It'll all work out.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.270
So what are we gonna do about that #10's quick?

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.790
What are we gonna do?

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.860
Wh-What will we do?

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.880
Don't think too much about it.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.550
We just have to go at them harder! Yeah!

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.330
What are you going to do now, Misaki?

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.240
I don't have anyone to take over for me,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.210
so I'm thinking about staying until the spring tournament.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.350
That puts me at ease a little.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.880
When they're doing well, everything is fine,

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.180
but once they break, I think they're still pretty weak,

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.290
so you'll have to spank them for me.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.270
I don't think they'll listen to me.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.230
That's not true.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.160
Yeah! Let's go all out! Way out!

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:18.880
All right!

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.380
Way out! Way out!

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.240
What do you mean, "way out"?

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.810
Huh?

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.500
You guys try way too hard to solve things by getting riled up and excited.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.210
Eventually, there will come a time that's not fun.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.390
What are you going to do then?

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.090
Even then, I'll do my best to have fun.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.400
Having fun even if you're inferior or not doing well?

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.850
If anyone's actually like that, they're either creeps or weirdos.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.400
M-Misaki? What's wrong?

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.770
I'm sorry, Sensei.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.860
But if I don't say this when they have an idea of their weakness,

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.490
I don't think they'll get it, so please let me finish.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.040
Huh? Uh, okay...

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.410
Okudake-kun told me to give these guys a spanking...

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.480
Spank?

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.290
Hana-san... ...said "spank!"

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.500
Well, yeah, the situation right now isn't fun.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.880
It's annoying, but those guys are playing around much more freely.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.940
Okudake-kun used to always say in order to play,

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.810
you need a place to play.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.800
Endure through the time that's not fun,

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.400
and play all the way to the end.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.580
I thought I heard that pretty lady say "spank"...

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.800
What's wrong?

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.960
Kiyoko-san...

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.790
I'm not sure why I'm asking, but would you scold us, too?

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.920
In the most condescending way possible.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.920
No.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:54.990
Then—

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.470
I will not spank you, either.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.250
We got Kiyoko-san to say "spank!"

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.210
Johzenji                   Karasuno

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.180
Now that we're in the middle of our second set...

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.080
It looks like we're finally starting the second round.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.500
Johzenji's style of volleyball is constantly changing.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.030
We do that, too!

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.090
Rolling... Headbutt!

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.600
You're so cool, Noya-san!

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.160
Er, that's not volleyball... Episode 16: "Next"

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.250
Next time on Haikyu!!: "Next."
