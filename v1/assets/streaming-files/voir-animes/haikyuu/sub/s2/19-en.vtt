WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:44.230
Go, go, let's go! Let's go Date Tech!

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.880
Well? Are they winning?!

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.320
Don't push.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.030
Date Tech         Aoba Johsai

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.560
Wait. They're still only two points ahead.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.160
They're on the second set right now.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.030
Who got the first set?

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.100
Um...

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.840
Apparently Seijoh got the first set.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.020
Ah, Karasuno!

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.000
H-Hello, there...

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.690
Hey.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.820
Heyo.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.640
Heyo.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.760
Hey.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.090
Karasuno's got some third-years left.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.250
Yeah.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.230
How's our new team doing?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.650
Makki!

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.110
Damn it... They're seeing right through them.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.320
Rule the Court

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.510
Great, great, Takahiro! Push it, push it, Takahiro! One more!

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.290
Date Tech                            Aoba Johsai

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.140
Hanamaki, nice serve!

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.710
Sorry!
Kogane!

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.960
Got it!

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.020
Date Tech has a new setter.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.920
Yeah,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.340
I wonder what kind of toss...

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.030
What the heck was that?!

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.910
Haikyu!!

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.520
Episode 19: "The Iron Wall Can Be Rebuilt Again and Again."

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.550
Kogane!

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.590
Got it!

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.920
Good! Go!

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.880
Kogane's moves still seem rough.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.950
Well, as long as the ball goes up.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.040
Left!
Right!

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.120
What the heck was that?!

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.760
Futakuchi-senpai, I'm counting on you!

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.080
It's too high!

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.580
I'm not good with high ones!

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.250
All right!

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.950
Sorry!

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.680
Lucky!

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.400
Futakuchi-senpai, don't mind!

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.100
A-A little lower, Koganegawa.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.940
Right! Lower!

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.680
Don't make it too low.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.400
I need it in the middle. The middle.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.480
Right!

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.190
You sure you got it?

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.480
Of course!

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.620
Sorry.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.820
No worries!

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.720
Date Tech's setter is a first-year, right? #7.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.480
Yeah.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.710
He's big... One touch!

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.960
Yeah, he is.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.620
That's our new weapon.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.830
The giant setter, Koganegawa.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.560
Giant... ...setter?

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.950
Nice catch!

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.600
I'm sorry!

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.740
I'll run around the school a hundred times to make up for it!

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.910
You should probably practice tossing instead!

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.650
H-He's still learning.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.410
He just became a setter.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.360
He'll eventually be a huge deal.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.260
Th-Those kinds of mistakes happen all the time...

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.720
Er, uh... He's definitely got the potential! Really!

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.790
You're making Karasuno's captain take pity on you, Moniwa...

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.140
Nice serve!

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.170
I was selfish, so I'm sure my senpais had a hard time with me,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.230
Bring it!

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.700
All right, bring it!

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.520
but I have to wonder about being too serious, too.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.440
Futakuchi is having trouble with his junior...

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.740
Serves him right.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.700
Date Tech                   Aoba Johsai

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.700
Matsukawa, nice serve!

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.260
They really don't want to let them get any more of a lead...
Bring it!

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.740
Cut it off with the one!

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.160
Left!

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.660
Those are movements for a dump... It's high.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.250
Above the block... But it's...

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.170
...completely obvious!

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.380
Huh?
Damn it.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.210
Chance! Chance!
Iwa-chan!

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.530
Nice, Sakunami!

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.930
Futakuchi, get the last!

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.800
One touch!

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.510
Got it! Makki!

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.970
Got it!

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.060
The wing spiker, #3, did the toss?

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.570
Oikawa!

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.040
Oikawa-san!

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.920
Don't mind!

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.520
Kogane, nice block!

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.160
Learn to hold back, you idiot!

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.570
Right! Sorry!

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.490
Are you okay, Futakuchi-senpai?

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.400
No, I'm not! That's why I'm telling you to learn to hold back!

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.120
It's my fault for not being able to brace it better.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:29.950
That was fine.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.780
Right.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.490
That is...

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.620
...our new iron wall... Koganegawa.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.880
New... ...iron wall.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.660
He reworded it because it didn't work out so well earlier.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.640
Looks like we're up against an annoying team again.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.610
Honestly, that was sort of refreshing.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.330
True.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.670
I can hear you.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.440
Now, then... What to do?

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.480
Nice receive!

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.670
Got it!

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.860
Kindaichi!

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.080
A counter!
All right!

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.330
I guess it's to be expected.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.140
Seriously! You're totally obvious!

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.850
Sorry! But a dump is so cool that I wanted to try it!

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.290
And that's why he's so obvious...

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.510
Look, you don't need to feint when you do a dump attack.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.440
Huh?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.760
What?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.260
Date Tech Aoba Johsai Nice serve!

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.960
Oikawa-san, nice serve!

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.870
Rule the Court All right!

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.820
Great, great, Toru! Push it, push it, Toru! One more time!

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.980
It looks like Seijoh has the upper hand.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.240
Date Tech is still flailing around.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.620
Once their giant setter settles, I'm sure he'll be an amazing weapon.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.400
Oikawa, one more nice serve!

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.960
Damn it!

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.250
It's going over the net!

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.430
Chance ball!

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.200
Another quick is coming!

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.890
Left!
Center!

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.770
#12! #12!

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.100
Listen up.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.560
Koganegawa's basically still a baby as a setter.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.950
Date Tech So you need to help him out, Sakunami.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.710
Go somewhere convenient for Koganegawa-kun...

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.990
And receive!

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.420
Good!

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.080
When you receive the ball,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.170
get it high enough for Koganegawa to do a jump toss.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.170
It doesn't matter if it's not that close to the net.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.420
He'll get it.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.470
You don't need to think about anything difficult yet.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.430
Just get it from one high place...

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.460
...to another!

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.230
Date Tech                      Aoba Johsai
Nice kill! Aone!

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.580
So fast! So high!

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.300
Putting it right where the spiker will hit it.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.260
That's definitely a combo that's only possible because of the setter's height.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.620
Kogane, nice toss!

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.790
Thanks!
A toss that takes advantage of his height...

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.000
That huge setter's pretty fun.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:43.520
Haikyu!!

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.980
Date Tech                   Aoba Johsai

00:09:43.520 --> 00:10:01.600
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Date Tech!

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:46.980
We're going to catch up!

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.190
One block here!

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.540
Jingo, nice serve!

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.900
Got it!

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.970
Nice receive!

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.640
All right!

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.290
Great, great, Toru! Push it, push it, Toru! One more time!

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.610
And a dump!

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.480
Right when I thought he was laying low today.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.360
So calm.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.210
So frustrating.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.420
Date Tech                     Aoba Johsai

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:28.570
One more point! One more point!

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.980
And now Seijoh is at match point.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.020
Calm down! Let's break it off with this one!

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.570
Right!

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.820
Hanamaki, nice serve!

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.700
Nice!

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.450
The Seijoh players have all improved their serves.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.830
Cover! Cover!

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.990
Yeah...

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.190
Left!
Futakuchi-san!

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.490
All right!

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.940
Futakuchi, go!

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.830
Yeah!

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.690
All right!

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:57.300
Nice kill, Futakuchi! Go, go, Futakuchi!

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.950
You see our juniors?!

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.380
You'd better be watching!

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.500
And now,

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.340
their first-year setter is on the front line.
All right!

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.510
Onagawa-senpai, nice serve!

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.980
Futakuchi's the ace, and good at blocking.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.140
Then the center of the iron wall, Aone...

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.980
And then the third... Koganegawa.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.490
Without a doubt, right now,

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.860
they are the best set of three blockers in the prefecture.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.260
Nice serve!

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.900
Sorry! It's a bit short!

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.840
Iwa-chan!
Yeah.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.210
One touch!
Pantaloons!

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.000
Got it!

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.060
Kogane!
Right!

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.230
Or rather, you don't need to do a feint when doing a dump attack.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.390
Huh?

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.100
Smash it!

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.800
Whoa. This time, he did a dump and smashed it.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:59.790
Nice kill, Kanji! Go, go, Kanji!

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.990
You wouldn't be able to get that even if you saw it coming.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.350
Yeah!
All right! Break!

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.540
One more! Go!
Date Tech                        Aoba Johsai

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.780
Hey... Hm?

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.020
Do what we usually do...

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.500
Let me take this challenge.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:14.760
Got it.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.310
Oikawa tossed away from the net to avoid the block, right?

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.780
Apparently Iwaizumi didn't like that much.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.350
Well, it does make it harder to hit.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.120
One more point!

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.410
Nice serve!

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.410
Got it!

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.480
Saku-kun, nice receive!

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.960
But it's gonna go over the net!

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.720
It's up!
Just one more point!

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.790
Cover! Cover!
End it with this!

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.820
Stop it!

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.700
Don't let them have it!

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.210
Iwa-chan!

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.670
Yep!

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.380
Right now, I'm basically a baby as a setter.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:11.690
If there's anything right now that I have that is equal to my senpais,

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.810
it's my height!

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.520
We're not going to let it...

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.610
...end here!

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.620
Your resolve is weak,

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.830
you little first-year!

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.230
It went through the middle of his arms!

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.320
That's awesome, Iwaizumi!

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.240
You awesome guy!

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.430
You're amazing, Iwaizumi-san!

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:01.420
Nice kill.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.110
I guess I still have a lot to learn.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.070
He faced those three blockers head-on.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.850
I hate to admit it, but that was awesome.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.630
Date Tech                   Aoba Johsai

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.090
Thank you very much!

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.550
I guess we know...

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.460
...who we'll face next.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.970
Line up.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.940
What do you mean, "Geh?" Futakuchi, you jerk.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.320
You still suck, Kogane!

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.060
I'm sorry!

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.890
And the new captain totally has his hands full.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.920
Do you understand how important Moniwa was now?

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.790
I've always known that!

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.710
Good grief... I only see potential here.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.680
Not to mention, a lot of potential.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.840
Keep working hard, even more than you have been.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.350
You guys will form the ultimate iron wall yet.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.610
All right, let's go.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.640
Huh?

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.530
The fact that you guys are here means you have time on your hands, right?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.890
Come back and practice with us.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.600
What?

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.440
I guess we don't have a choice.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.990
Don't start stripping here.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.220
Kamasaki-san, are you getting so bulked up that you can't jump anymore?

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.520
Huh? Why?

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.360
Well, muscles are heavy.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.130
Huh... Seriously?

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.010
I...

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.550
I'll get to the point where I can lift any kind of ball!

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.180
And I'll be able to block!

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.600
So I won't shame the title of the iron wall,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.290
I'll make sure I'm able to stop anyone,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.710
no matter how powerful or big they are!

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:10.830
Opponents that are hard to stop aren't always big or strong.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.060
Hinata Shoyo...

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.230
Next time, I'm definitely going to stop you.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.950
Aoba Johsai                                Karasuno

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.410
I-Is everyone on edge for some reason?

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.090
Last time, they gave their all against Aoba Johsai,

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.860
and still lost.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.810
Y-Yachi-san... Yes?!

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.280
D-Do you have any stomach medicine?

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.520
Are you all right, Yamaguchi-kun?

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.350
Shimizu!

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:15.020
Sorry, I'm just a little nervous.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.240
I... I'm pretty confident when it comes to being nervous!

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.740
Huh? Confident? About being nervous?

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.830
It's better when you voice your nerves.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.350
Saying, "I'm so nervous! What should I do?!"

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.710
instead of holding it in makes you feel much better.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.580
I regularly experience live-threatening fear because of my nerves,

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.080
so I've done a lot of research.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.440
Life-threatening dangers?

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.560
Like sports festivals and tests!

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.540
Tests?

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.930
Well... Yes?

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.460
When we had our Inter-High match against Seijoh...

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.020
When the team was in trouble,

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.460
I was brought in as the pinch server for the first time.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.610
Aoba Johsai                                Karasuno
We weren't that far behind in points.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.320
If I had made it, we might have won.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.180
And yet, I blew it...

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.500
When I think about that happening again...

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.510
Y...

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.180
You were put in charge of something that important?!

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.720
Yachi-san?!

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.160
I'm getting nervous.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.180
My heart's going to pop out... right out of my mouth!

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.360
Swallow it back in!

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.900
Do you want some stomach medicine?! Do you need assistance?! An AED?

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:34.970
What's going on?!

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.680
Yachi-san's heart!

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.980
Her heart! Waaah!

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.640
Calm down, Yamaguchi!

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.980
Should we call 110?!

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.860
It's 119.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.170
Hey, where're you going?
I wonder if nerves are like a cold

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.950
and you get better when you give it to someone else.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.680
You all seem better.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.830
Why are you trying to explain this rationally?

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.770
Kageyama-kun, are you having your freak-out time, too?

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.140
Yeah.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.110
Oikawa-san's strong.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.820
You really can't handle the Great King, huh?

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.280
Well, I'm in the same boat.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.720
You were looking forward to fighting him.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.230
You can't help what freaks you out.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.960
You're stronger when all six of you are strong.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.940
Huh?

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:24.660
I heard Iwaizumi-san say that to Oikawa-san before.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.720
Of course we're stronger with six, you dumbass.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.990
At the time, I was wondering why he said something so obvious.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:39.740
Of course you're stronger if all six players are strong.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.050
But now I really understand.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.960
Iwaizumi-san was talking about adding everyone's strengths together.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.600
He was talking about multiplying them.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.150
No matter what team he's on,

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.180
Oikawa-san is able to bring out the spiker's strength better than I can.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.820
Really?

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.820
Even if that's the case...

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.560
But we're Karasuno, remember?

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.280
All right, is everyone here?

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.660
It's almost time.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.730
All right, let's go!

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.310
Yeah!

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.730
We're going to get our revenge...

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.280
...with our new quick!

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.920
Ma'am, can I get another pork cutlet bowl?

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.790
You're eating way too much. That's your fourth one.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.060
I'm gonna strive to become the ultimate iron wall,

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.030
and try to grow until I'm two meters tall.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.280
Er, you should be striving to learn how to play better...

00:23:56.410 --> 00:24:00.500
