WEBVTT

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.940
Gather round!

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.670
Our first game today is with Nekoma.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.400
How did we do yesterday?

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.620
This will be our third set overall with Nekoma.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.510
Yesterday, we played two sets with them.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.400
The scores were 17-25 and 19-25, both our losses.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.850
Simply put, we haven't won a single set.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.490
But if we calm down and go out there in full force,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.330
they should be opponents we can fight on equal footing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.800
Hinata and Kageyama, this is your first Nekoma set in a while, isn't it?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.120
Go show 'em what you've got.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.840
Right!

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.080
Okay, we're good to go.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.310
Nice serve, Fukunaga!

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.110
I'll be the first one to stop your quick tomorrow, Hinata.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.730
Come on! Bring it!

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.880
Haikyu!!

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.330
Episode 5: "Greed"

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.300
Tenchu

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.300
I drank way too much with the teachers last night.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.550
What time is it?

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.970
Nice receive!

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.610
All right!
Damn it... That's amazing.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.880
Don't mind, Lev!

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.830
That was close.
Okay!

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.070
So Karasuno's #10 really is closing his eyes when he hits the quick.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.170
One more, Tanaka! Nice serve!

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.040
Yeah.
Cover! Cover!

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.810
Which means the truth behind that godly quick attack

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.030
is the setter's superior technique.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.950
Nice receive, Daichi-san!

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.460
He flew from A to C.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.710
All right!

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.260
He actually did it!
H-He stopped it...

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.240
He stopped that quick attack so easily.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.470
Well, Nekoma's always been

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.270
pretty good at reacting to that quick attack.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.840
On top of that, that newbie middle blocker's height

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.480
and quick reaction time are amazing.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.140
Nice serve, Kenma!

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.650
Hey, I'm gonna add in more normal quicks.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.960
The floaty ones.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.040
Hey, are you listening?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.980
Yeah...

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.580
Lev.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.830
They're probably going to start using a lot of normal quicks,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.890
so please switch over to read blocks.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.100
What's a read block again?

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.440
It's when you see where the toss is going to go, then jump up and block.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.970
Ah, okay.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.140
Nice serve!

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.840
Ryu!
Got it!

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.530
It's when you see where the toss is going to go...

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.950
One touch!

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.670
I thought he was totally being lured by Hinata.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.700
Even though it was a bit late, his block is still high.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.140
Chance ball!

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.040
These guys... All right!

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.250
Damn it!

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.800
Karasuno Nekoma Now, calm down.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.400
They already had a careful eye on our quicks.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.240
For the time being, when we're up against Nekoma,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.850
let's mainly have Azumane and Tanaka attacking from the left.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.760
Right.
Got it!
All right!

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.000
We've only just begun!

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.900
Is that all right? Or is that being weak?

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.320
Let's calm down and get that point.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.570
Is there any evolution that comes from

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.780
going on the defensive, Keishin?

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.240
Here.
Thanks.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.990
Here you go, Azumane-san.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.580
Crap... What is this?

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.880
Nekoma, Lev... They're strong. They're so strong!

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.170
I have to get stronger, Shiratorizawa Academy

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.170
or there's no way we'll win!

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.240
Cover! Cover!

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.590
Left!

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.950
Two blockers!

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.510
Right!

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.080
It's up! Nice, Kageyama!

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.730
Nice cover!

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.990
All right, let's get the last ball!

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.510
Sorry! It was a bit short!

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.280
Asahi!
Last ball!

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.030
Yeah!

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.030
Huh?

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.210
U-U-U-Uh... Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh—

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.920
I'm sorry!

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.940
I was just staring at the ball... I'm sorry!

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.940
Are you okay? I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.670
I-I'm perfectly fine... I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.960
Hey, be careful.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.560
No matter what, Shoyo's gonna be the one that goes flying.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.900
Pay attention to your surroundings, you idiot!

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.140
Why do you think everyone's calling the ball, you dumbass?!

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.270
Right... I'm sorry.
Moron! Hinata, you moron!

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.980
Now, now. Calm down, Kageyama.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.230
I'm sure Hinata acted completely subconsciously just then,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.780
but it looked like he was trying to steal the toss from the ace.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.660
Is the baby crow about to evolve?

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.660
And will that be a blessing or a curse for their team?

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.910
Though in the end, those who do not want to change will not evolve.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.380
If that is what you wish for,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.250
even if you are the star of the court, the hero,

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.390
or the ace that brings forth the victory,

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.890
you need to greedily proclaim that you are indeed

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.160
the best.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.330
Hey, Kageyama.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.060
What?

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.060
The quick that goes like whoosh...

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.380
I'll...

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.950
stop closing my eyes.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:26.970
Haikyu!!

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.060
I'll...

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.920
stop closing my eyes.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.350
I can't stay like this.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.200
I can't keep hitting quicks that are set just for me.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.520
You can't, and that's why we learned normal quicks.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.410
I don't know what's going on with you right now,

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.300
but if you have something to say, I'll listen to it later.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.380
But if you're gonna do that right now,

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.340
I'm not going to set to a guy who I know will miss.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.700
Nice serve!

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.520
Asahi-san!

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.360
Sorry, cover!

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.620
I couldn't understand the conversation from earlier, but...

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.680
Got it!

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.760
Left!

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.740
I wasn't imagining the tension

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.540
between Hinata and Kageyama-kun, right?

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.390
Yeah...

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.860
One touch! Chance ball!

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.520
But it's not just Hinata and Kageyama.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.480
Ever since Hinata and Azumane bumped into each other,

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.570
they're all on edge.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.400
All right!

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.790
Karasuno Nekoma All right!

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:36.780
Let's go!

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.450
I can't stay like this.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.420
Hinata just blurted out what we all had realized.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.340
What happened there was looming fear.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.680
All right! Here I go!

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.340
At this rate, I'm going to be eaten up by Hinata,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.340
I'll show you how it's done!

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.590
whose greed keeps growing.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.300
It appears that there's been a change in your players' wills.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.080
It's true that an impasse like this is a perfect time to grow,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.620
Gather round!

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.530
but how am I supposed to explain that?

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.240
You guys are the weakest team out of all the teams here.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.950
We can't argue with that...

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.600
If we were to have an official match with any of these teams,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.420
they would be a troublesome opponent.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.320
Are we going to view them as mere opponents,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.880
or teachers that we can absorb techniques from?

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.990
The fact that you are weak just means that you have room to grow.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.470
There's nothing more exciting than that.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.890
Thank you!

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.410
What you said out there

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.540
made you almost seem like a really reliable teacher.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.600
Thanks!

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.110
Uh, well... I am a teacher, so...

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.030
It wouldn't hurt to at least try.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.730
I mean, he was able to do a normal quick

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.490
on the fly in the last Nekoma match.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.850
At the time, there was a possibility the normal quick would work,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.030
and I thought that was the only chance we had.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.920
Before I knew it, we lost the last set with Seijoh.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:18.800
When I realized it,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.610
the ball that was hit was behind me,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.400
and on the floor.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.850
Sorry.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.370
They totally read me in the end.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.480
I'm the one who lost,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.320
so I don't want you to apologize, Kageyama.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.990
I want to fight in mid-air until the very last moment.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.400
I sort of realized in the Seijoh match that it's the setter that brings out

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.670
100% of the spiker's strength.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.880
That quick is your ultimate weapon.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.410
Any slight slippage in that quick

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.120
becomes a fatal mistake.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.600
Your will is not needed for that quick.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.340
Kageyama isn't denying his worth out of emotion.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.430
He's just stating the truth.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.960
Sorry, Hinata.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.650
This time, I've got to agree with Kageyama

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.790
after hearing him say that.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.030
That quick is amazing in itself.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.770
I think it might be best that you use that as an axis,

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.130
and polish up other attacks.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.760
Yeah... I agree with Sugawara.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.420
Ukai-san.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.470
You say that you want to fight on your own,

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.120
but that weirdo quick is a battle that lasts a split second.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.000
I honestly think it's pretty hard

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.550
trying to figure out what to do in that split second mid-air.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.340
But when I'm doing well, I can see it in slow motion,

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.450
just like Tanaka-san said.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.080
Some times, I can see the opponent's block

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.030
in slow motion in the air.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.290
It's just like light passing by.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.880
Well, there are times that blocks are more visible.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.960
In the practice match against Seijoh...

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:18.960
The last point...

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.900
The Great King...

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.180
I could see Oikawa-san's face.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:24.930
I could see his eyes.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.890
Face? Eyes?

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.250
Oh... You mean you felt like you saw them, right?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.100
Even when I first did that quick during our 3-on-3...

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.440
I could see the other side.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.040
I could see the scenery from the very top.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.300
But you mean you just felt like you saw...

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.040
Oh, there you are. We're starting.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.180
Oh, I'll be right there.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.460
Fukurodani Karasuno Narita.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:00.800
Yes?

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.540
Switch out with Hinata next.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.280
Huh? Uh, yes, sir!

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.130
Despite what you think you want to accomplish,

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.810
you need to chill out today.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.180
I don't think it's gonna work to try things out today,

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.690
and I'm not gonna have you end up in a contact play like that again

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:18.920
and get hurt.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.540
All right!

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.470
One!
Don't mind! Don't mind!

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.510
Next one! Next one!

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.410
One more on the dot!

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.090
All right!

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:34.860
Don't mind!

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.410
Nice kill, Lev!

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.180
All right!

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.730
Cover! Cover!

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:39.870
Nice serve!

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.960
One more! Nice serve!

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.130
Thank you very much!

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.260
Thank you!

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.720
We'll see you the week after next,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.720
at the summer vacation training camp.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.470
Yes, sir! It'll be a pleasure working with you!

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.930
This is where it's going to get real.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.450
It's the last long-term training camp before the spring tournament prelims.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.150
Yes.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.520
Just know that you're gonna be joining me for drinks every night for a week.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.610
Yes, sir!

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.590
Thank you very much.
I'm mentioning this a bit late, No worries.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.670
but looks like all your third-years stuck around, too.
I'll start packing the gear into the back,

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.900
so keep bringing me more.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.190
Yeah. You guys ended up going Right!

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.130
against last year's winners on the second day, right?

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.040
During the Inter-High prelims?

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.640
I heard that from Hinata.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.440
Yeah. We stopped at the quarterfinals.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.070
Tokyo's quarterfinals are amazing.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.260
There's no point if we don't win.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.790
You're right.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.680
See ya later, Hinata.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.760
I'll stop you next time, too.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.080
I'm not gonna lose!

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.500
I may be 163 centimeters, but I'll beat your 194-centimeter butt!

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.870
This training camp was really great.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.110
I think we found a lot of areas for improvement.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:07.050
Well, we're gonna have to take them one at a time.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.880
Indeed. Let's go home and carefully think about them.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.250
Go home, huh...

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.350
Ukai-kun?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.230
Speaking of going home,

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.900
a rather annoying relative is coming home...

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.020
All right, everyone. Good work.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.580
Thank you!

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.300
So, as I mentioned, tomorrow there will be inspections in the gym,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.990
so there'll be no club activities.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.750
You've all gone a long time without a break,

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.510
so please enjoy it.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.000
Kageyama.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.170
Give me a toss.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.800
Huh?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.120
You two aren't going home yet?

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.850
Yachi-san, if you don't mind,

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.400
could you throw us some balls?

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.530
Huh? Can I do that?

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.540
You just have to throw the ball above Kageyama's head.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.770
S-Sure! I'll give it a try.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.940
Let's do this!

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.190
Here you go.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.770
He keeps getting distracted by the ball

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.080
and can't jump his highest.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.970
One more time!

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.700
One more time!

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.960
Instead of practicing an attack we're not sure you'll ever be able to do,

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.850
you should be working on the attacks we've been using,

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.120
as well as serving and blocking!

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:05.820
But if this quick doesn't work,

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.820
there's no point in me being on the court.

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.930
And I told you, your will isn't needed for that quick!

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.170
I'll give you tosses that won't be stopped by blocks!

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.390
But then I'll never get better!

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.370
The prelims for the spring tournament start next month!

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.600
They're right around the corner.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.280
What do you think will be an effective weapon for us?

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.010
A complete quick or an absolutely useless quick?! Huh?!

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.440
N-No fighting, guys.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.050
Calm down, Kageyama-kun.
Damn it!

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.340
What I'm saying is correct, You, too, Hinata...

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.620
so why...

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.160
Why does he keep hanging on?!

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.860
I want to be strong enough to compete by myself!

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.970
Your selfishness is going to destroy the team's balance!

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.460
L-Let's all...

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.010
Let's all be friends, o-okay?!

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.680
I'll toss to anyone who's essential to winning.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.140
But I don't think you're essential to winning right now.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.640
And I don't feel any different now.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.530
Kageyama!

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.300
Damn it! Let go!

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.150
I won't let go until you give me a toss!

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.940
Give me one!
Someone... Senpai!

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.760
Don't be ridiculous!

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.880
That quick was stopped!

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.130
Today, and during the Seijoh match!

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.340
Are you trying to say that my toss was at fault?

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.500
No! That's not it!

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.950
It was perfect! It was spot-on!

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.300
And yet, it was stopped!

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.420
If I don't get better, it's not going to work on stronger opponents, either!

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.480
Hey!

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.930
Stop it, you two!

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.460
I-I'm just going to the bus stop over there, so I'm fine here.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.080
Thanks.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.170
I'm sorry, Yachi-san.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.540
N-No worries!

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.060
It's fine... I'm totally fine.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.900
But you're...

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.100
In my first and final tournament in junior high,

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.180
we were destroyed by Kageyama.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.000
I vowed revenge when I got into high school,

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.100
Kids' Volleyball and of course I ran right into him.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.780
He was even worse than I could have imagined and we went through a lot,

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.170
but once we started playing our matches, I felt like we understood each other.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.120
It wasn't that he was the first friend I'd made. He was a partner.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.080
Well, see you later.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:51.750
Yeah...

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.130
What?

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.100
They got into a fight?

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.550
There's been tension between them ever since the training camp.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:19.320
I wonder if they're gonna be okay, considering the spring tournament's coming up.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.060
But this isn't the first time they've ever fought, is it?

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.460
Come to think of it,

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.160
they were fighting even before they turned in their membership applications.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.080
What? Seriously?

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.770
The first day, they blew off the Vice Principal's toupee,

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.040
and they even got shut out of the gym by Daichi.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.580
It was ridiculous.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.320
Well, that also means they've gotten over those things, too...

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.550
Right? So I think

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.870
we should just believe in them and wait.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.890
Sakanoshita Shop Thank ya.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.150
Considering he was never able to see it,

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.780
it's pretty much impossible for him to power it up even more.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.130
I could see the other side.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.860
I could see the scenery from the very top.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:09.780
Those eyes...

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.150
The moment you're at the highest point of a jump

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.500
is a mere moment.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.970
Even if you're able to see the block,

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.460
it shouldn't be anything more than a blur.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.270
But every once in a while,

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.160
I've heard that there are moments

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.970
where spikers can clearly see the blockers' fingers, and even beyond that.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.860
Can Hinata actually see that?

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.310
A quick attack that comes from a spectacular set up...

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.770
If Hinata could hit that at will while in mid-air...

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.300
No, no, no... There's no way!

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.910
It's just an empty theory.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.830
But maybe...

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.400
If he could actually do it,

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.450
that duo would become even greater champions

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.340
of mid-air battle than the Little Giant.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.320
Welcome—

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.620
Oh, it's you, Hinata.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.420
Coach, exactly how am I supposed to practice?

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.860
Hinata and Kageyama are fighting, huh?

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.490
You can totally feel their youth.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.840
Yeah, I can't say I really feel any youth from you, Asahi.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.430
Huh? Then what do I feel like?

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.080
On the outside, your youth is over, Asahi.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:01.000
Episode 06: "Tempo"

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.660
That's so mean!

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.660
Next time on Haikyu!! "Tempo."
