WEBVTT

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.020
Aw, damn it.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.980
If we had won yesterday, we'd be in a match right now.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.720
Now if only Karasuno can beat Shiratorizawa,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.130
we'll look a little cool.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.700
No, we wouldn't.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.820
If their #10 wasn't there, we would have won.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.580
No, you mean the setter.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.830
That guy is insane.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.040
I think it was the captain.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.540
The one that was the most interesting was their #10 though.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.760
The captain, huh?

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.220
Well, you've got a point.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.640
Sort of like the foundation that no one really notices?

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.990
Haikyu!!

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.770
Sawamura-san!

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.020
Daichi!
Daichi-san!

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.910
Episode 17: "The Battle Without Will Power"

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.760
What's going on?
What's wrong?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.910
He's on the ground.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.970
What's going on?

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.370
They collided.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.030
Right after they returned that last ball,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.050
#5, the bald guy, and the captain crashed into each other.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.120
It looked like he hit his head pretty hard.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.010
Seriously?

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.100
Ow... Where did you get hit?

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.680
M-My face?

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.580
Sawamura-kun, where are you right now?

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.410
Sendai City, in the gym.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.270
Who are we playing right now?

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.490
W-Wakunan.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.980
I'm fine!

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.060
But it appears that you hit your head,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.690
so please go to the infirmary.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.500
Right.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.720
Go have them confirm that you really are okay.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.960
That's the quickest way for you to return to the match.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.040
Yes, sir.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.900
Blood... Eh?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.460
Did you cut your lip?

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.680
He doesn't seem to be dizzy.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.080
A tooth?!

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.900
There's a possibility their captain won't be playing any more this match.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.730
Though that's the coach's decision.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.580
It'd be scary if he had a concussion, though.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.110
Sensei, can I leave the rest to you?

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.240
D-Daichi-san...

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.230
I'm sorry—

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.330
Sorry, Tanaka.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.500
I saw you go in for the cover,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.700
but my body moved on its own and went in there.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.170
But look.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.400
Because you got that ball over, we're now in the 20s.
Karasuno                                                 Wakunan

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.230
Baldy from Karasuno usually displays a high level of mental toughness,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.370
but he's used to being forced into a corner.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.580
I wonder what he'll be like now, since he broke their leader.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.370
If they lose this match,

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.410
it'll probably be the captain's last.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.560
Sorry, Asahi. I'll be right back.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.250
Hold things down until then.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.070
I'm counting on you.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.670
Of course. Leave it to me.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.790
He's walking on his own, so I think he'll be okay.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.720
But the problem is this match.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.410
I wonder who's going to take charge in their head's place?

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.050
The second setter, maybe?

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.450
Unless there's someone who often practices in pairs,

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.610
a setter who's skilled enough in both offense and defense to take on a wing spiker...

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.580
It'll be hard for someone to fill in.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.910
A wing spiker to take his place, huh?

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.620
I'm not sure if Karasuno has one.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.340
You're the only one we have.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.380
We're counting on you.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.980
Chikara! You've got this!

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.750
He played in the practice match.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.250
What was he like again?

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.890
I don't really remember him.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.070
Well, he seemed like a guy who can handle things well.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.420
Karasuno doesn't have a lot of players,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.360
so they may just not have anyone else.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.340
This is the same as a practice match...

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.540
Same as a practice match...

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.920
Same...

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.290
Well, go out there, and give it all you've got.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.820
This isn't the same!

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.130
Playing behind him and taking his place are completely different.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.760
Oh, so it is you, Ennoshita-san.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.210
Is it okay if we start with a fast attack?

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.930
Ah... Sure.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.130
Chikara! Their #1 tends to hit toward the outside,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.560
so keep that in your head.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.200
R-Right... Ennoshita-san, you've got this!

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.130
Ennoshita, you have every right to be worried.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.840
Let's do this!

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.100
But if anyone has to replace Daichi, You can do it!

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.260
everyone on our team thinks it should be you.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.830
Ennoshita, sorry. We're counting on you.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.760
Fly What do you mean, "sorry"?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.500
About running into Daichi-san?

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.540
Of course one of you got hurt after something like that.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.930
In the end, maybe it may cause Daichi-san to leave the match,

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.040
but what's on our minds right now...

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.920
Asahi-san, if you would.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.060
...is how glad we are that you weren't hurt, too.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.840
Right, right. Come on, come on.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.360
Our offense is already weakened just by having Daichi-san out.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.950
If you get depressed, it'll just make things worse.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.600
Wow, this is surprising.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.480
At first glance, Ennoshita seems like he'd be pretty timid.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.660
No way!

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.480
Judging by how he is whenever he's over at our place,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.880
Chikara's definitely the don of the second-years.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.180
He's the best wing spiker for managing

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.020
the out-of-control second-years who are the core of our offense.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.560
And lately, his influence has spread to our first-year troublemakers, too.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.970
True...

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.270
Ennoshita, nice serve!

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.510
Nice receive!
Center!

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.450
All right!

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.370
All right...

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.200
We're gonna take this back quickly.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.590
Damn it... I'm sorry.
All right!

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.860
I'll guard a little wider.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.560
Thanks, Nishinoya.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.140
Don't worry!

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.860
There's no way I can beat Daichi-san in technique right now...

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.480
We'll get the next one!

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.380
But... now that I'm standing here,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.260
Takeru, one more! Nice serve!

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.810
there's no point in running away by making excuses like that.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.730
Not to mention...

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.660
I already know that I'd just make things troublesome later if I run away.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:48.230
Bring it!

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.460
Not bad, Karasuno's substitute captain!

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:16.610
Haikyu!!

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.180
Nothing's gonna change with the third-years taking charge until the spring tournament,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.720
but you second-years need to at least start thinking about

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.040
who's going to be the next captain.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.950
That's what Ukai-san was saying.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.750
The next, huh...

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.170
I think Chikara should do it.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.990
Why?!

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.500
Just 'cause.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.250
Wait, you just ate that popsicle in two bites.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.960
According to the rules, liberos can't be captains, right?

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.000
Yup!

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.600
I think Tanaka's qualified, too,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.440
but looking at the first-year lineup...

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.650
The simpleton idiots.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.150
The smartass.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.600
Yeah... you can't help but think that we need someone with a sound mind in charge.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.940
I agree with having Ennoshita as captain,

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.590
but I'm not fully satisfied.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.260
You two need to put yourselves in, too!

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.960
Nope, nope, nope, nope... Yeah, not happening.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.660
Damn it!

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.920
But I ran away...

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.010
There's no way I could lead the team.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.810
Summer vacation one year ago...

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.810
Not yet! Not until you can do this!

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.390
Come on! Don't get exhausted after that!

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.600
The day after, we lost two first-years...

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.950
At this rate, we're never gonna finish!

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.480
And a few days later...

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.320
I had gone to practice ever since junior high, but...

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.120
I skipped one for the first time.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.790
I pretended to be sick.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.640
I felt guilty,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.980
but I didn't have to deal with that painful practice,

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.780
or being yelled at.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.850
The air conditioner is amazing.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.660
The next day,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.140
and the day after that...

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.190
I don't have to run in the heat.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.400
I don't have to get yelled at.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.030
I wonder if I'm actually some huge masochist.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.950
I-I'm sorry I skipped!

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.720
Please let me practice!

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.320
Ennoshita, thank goodness you're back.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.770
Well don't come in your uniform, then!

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.800
Captain...

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.000
I-I'm sorry! I'll go change right now!

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.180
Dealing with other people is hard,

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.880
but you can't just be nice, either.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.200
Right.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.900
Hey! If you're going, get changed first.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.340
All right, let's get started.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.600
Right!

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.930
Get running!

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.100
Right!

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.190
R-Right... Karasuno... Fight!

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:12.650
Yeah!
Fight!

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.690
Yeah!

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.270
There were five first-years that boycotted practice at the time.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.050
Two of them quit the volleyball team,

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.220
and seem much livelier now.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.790
Which is better?

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.370
That probably depends on the person...

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.450
It was harder for me when I wasn't playing volleyball, so I came back.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:38.210
But the thought of running away... ...will stay with me

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.380
That might be why.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.040
You're back right now and that's all that matters.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.850
Hey, I won!

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:48.920
I'm gonna get another one.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.680
Not everybody who joins a sports club is going to be the reckless type.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.060
I don't know much about those who are a different type than me,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.770
but I think you do.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.360
Well, this is all in the future, so... Yeah.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.990
All right!

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.080
In any case, there's no way that a coward can do it.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.000
Bring it!

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.890
It's up!

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.060
Ennoshita, nice!

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.210
Connect it! Connect!

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.180
Give it to me!

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.470
Azumane-san!

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.640
All right!
Nice kill!

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.680
Chikara! Great job getting it up!

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.110
R-Right...

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.680
Even if I'm a coward,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.520
even if I'm no match for Daichi-san, I'm gonna fight!

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.390
That's why I came back!

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.740
Karasuno                   Wakunan

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.600
Asahi-san, nice serve!

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.490
Sorry!
All right!

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.470
It's okay. Let's get the next one!
Nice serve!

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:06.590
Nice, Asahi!

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.720
One more!

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.310
Like hell we're giving it to you again!

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.730
I'm gonna get this!

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.280
Nice, Hanayan!

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.900
Wakunan's pretty calm.
Nice!

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.720
Don't mind, don't mind! Let's do this!

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.360
Yamaguchi... Yes!

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.750
Nice receive!

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.310
Shimizu-senpai's calling you.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.500
All right!

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.710
Karasuno Wakunan Tanaka, nice kill!

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.130
Huh?

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.920
When Tsukishima's up to serve,

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.280
we'll have Yamaguchi come in as a pinch server.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.140
In this situation, we just want to avoid them coming back and taking this set.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.310
We're gonna make a run for it.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.900
All right.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.520
You're too tense.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.980
This isn't like last time when the other side had the lead.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.900
Right now, everyone's just thinking we're lucky if we get the point.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.490
Thanks, Tsukki!

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.840
Was that him trying to make someone feel better?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.770
Tsukishima's such a smartass.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.880
Yamaguchi, do you feel like throwing up?

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.120
Huh? Not just yet.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.760
Then you'll be fine.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.940
Because I feel like I will.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.880
A-Are you all right?

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.080
I can barely stand.
Well done, Ennoshita... What?!

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.510
He knows how to get people to calm down

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.600
when they're nervous.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.320
I feel sick...

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.920
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.530
Just like Tsukki said, we're in the lead.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.090
And I practiced...

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.260
Crap! The serve toss was a bit low!

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.640
Nice serve!

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.440
It's over the net!

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.270
Karasuno                        Wakunan
Just one more point!

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.530
Yamaguchi, nice serve!

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.620
One more!

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.990
R-Right... You've got this, Yamaguchi!

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.340
I was lucky that made it over.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.910
But if I miss the next one, the plus and minus will zero each other out.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.330
Then, I have to...

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.870
It's got to be better... to make sure to get it over.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.380
Huh? I guess he's not doing a jump serve this time?

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.490
Got it!

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.120
Nice!

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.690
He gave up on a jump floating serve?

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.040
Is this some kind of plan?

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.470
I think I remember that guy

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.460
missing a serve when he was the pinch server during the Seijoh match, too.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.650
Not to mention, that last serve was dangerous, too.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.780
I think he's just scared.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.820
Crap! An attack is coming.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.570
Move, legs!

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.320
It's falling! Front, front, front!

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.160
Move, legs!

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.800
It's up!
Cover! Cover!

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.920
Nice, Chikara!

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.610
Azumane-san!

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.380
Right!

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.060
All right!

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.720
Karasuno                                   Wakunan

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.720
All right!

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.790
Asahi-san, that last back attack was awesome!

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:52.620
Thanks.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.820
Hey, Ukai-san's back.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.700
Doesn't he seem really pissed off?

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.550
Yamaguchi!

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.550
U-Um...

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.210
H-He knows.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.620
I think he knows more than anyone else.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.030
What? Was there a problem?

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.550
Even if you don't jump,

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.680
you can make serves that don't spin and are hard to receive.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.640
But if you jump and hit it from a higher point,

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.620
the ball will travel faster and with more force.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.770
Huh...

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:36.480
I don't think it's bad to be cautious right now.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.950
Wakunan                       Karasuno

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.410
In the end, Karasuno scored the point.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.950
But...

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.500
For Tadashi to be able to fight as hard as everyone else around him right now,

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.280
the serve is all he's got.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.910
If he runs away from that, there's nothing left.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.970
What else do we need besides pride?

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.180
Hey, Tsukishima.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.840
I acted all tough with Tsukki,

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.590
Don't you have something to say to Yamaguchi?

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.480
but I'm just a coward.
Why don't you go say something?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.300
I'm so lame...

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.320
Ukai-san, how's Daichi-san?

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.700
He's fine. There's no worry of a concussion.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.790
But his mouth is bleeding pretty badly, and he's in a lot of pain.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.010
I'm having him rest for a while, just in case.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.260
I know.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.600
We're gonna win, and ready the next stage for Sawamura.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.520
There's nothing else to think about right now!

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.150
Right!

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.060
All right, let's go!

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.440
Karasuno, fight!

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.640
Yeah!

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.970
Furiously Vigorous Nice kill, Ushijima!

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:33.850
Ushijima!

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:33.850
Shiratorizawa                                       Hakusuikan

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.020
Shiratorizawa's just got five more points to go.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:40.840
Let's go.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.930
Yup.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.320
Also, the match between Karasuno and Wakunan

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.530
seems like it's going to go on for a while.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.180
I wonder how Karasuno's doing without their captain.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.770
Just because a super receive is flashy,

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.750
doesn't mean it's good.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.680
If a ball that had always gone up for them

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.460
suddenly doesn't go up anymore,

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:08.430
Wakunan                                        Karasuno

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:07.240
that will slowly but surely get to them.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.240
I think...

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.390
They're feeling that right about now.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.120
Nothing less from Ennoshita-san.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.580
You'd probably make a good captain.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.600
I wonder who'd be fitting for vice captain...

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.660
Tanaka-san and Noya-san definitely aren't it.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:54.280
Why?

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.550
Because they're both kids.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.910
Did that really just come out of your mouth?

00:23:55.910 --> 00:24:00.620
Episode 18: "The Losers"
