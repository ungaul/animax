WEBVTT

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.940
Is that... Could that be...

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.980
The Skytree?!

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.140
No, that's just a transmission tower.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.610
Samurai of the East Nekoma Metropolitan High School

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.370
Here we are, Tokyo!

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.920
The scenery's not that different from Miyagi.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.320
Well, we're in the suburbs.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.830
Walk faster!

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.290
Actually, hey...

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.890
Aren't we missing some people?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.500
Actually...

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.820
This is how awesome...

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.120
...your senpais are!

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.150
You both barely got over 40 points...

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.180
What? Hinata, you failed English?

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.400
But you were so confident...

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.750
Apparently, he figured out right before time was up

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.160
that he'd filled in all his answers off by one.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.750
Seriously?

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.010
Sadly, the English teacher, Ono-sensei, won't let things like that slide.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.620
Yeah, Yachi-san was really shocked.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.830
They're right... They're right!

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.340
And Kageyama failed modern lit...

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.700
Apparently, there were a lot of reading comprehension questions this time around.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.960
But he'd concentrated on memorization when he studied.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.800
Wow, he got a perfect score on kanji. Dang...

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.240
Well, don't be too discouraged.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.870
This won't be the only time we have away games...

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.500
How are we gonna get to Tokyo?

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.920
Should we run?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.980
Nah, we need bikes.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.310
They're totally planning on going.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.130
Hey, you two.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.780
Huh?

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.030
So the power duo's taking some supplementary exams right now?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.600
Yeah... But, well...

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.290
Th...

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.580
Th...

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.400
There're two girls now!

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.550
Now they've got a pretty one and a cute one!

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.510
A mohawk... Tokyo's intense.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.510
Do you see, Tora?

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:08.190
Samurai of the East

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.280
This is what Karasuno's true ability looks like.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.880
So bright!

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.360
Let's go.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.490
R-Right...

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.900
All right. When you're all ready, come to the gym.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.110
The other guys are already there.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.810
Yeah.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.840
Haikyu!!

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.960
Episode 4: "Center Ace"

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.420
Well, well... You two look unusually serious.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.880
You guys only failed one test, right?

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.280
Then you should be able to finish your supplementary exam in the morning.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.600
After that, I'll call your savior.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.310
Do your best!

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.070
Hey, failure boys.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.110
Karasuno Cafeteria Get in.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.590
A-Are you Tanaka-san's older sister?

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.580
Call me Saeko-nesan.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.100
I'll get you two to Tokyo in no time.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.500
Saeko-nesan!

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.380
Karasuno Cafeteria All right, here we go!

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.130
Yeah!

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.610
However, the safety and comfort of the ride absolutely cannot be guaranteed.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.610
Thank you for your understanding.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.750
It's been a long time,

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.440
Nekomata-sensei.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.110
Glad you could come all this way.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.460
Thank you so much for letting us participate in the group practices.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.820
Not a problem. I'm looking forward to seeing

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.930
just how much stronger they've grown.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.370
Let's play!

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.890
Yeah!

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.100
Huh? Where's Shoyo?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.230
Apparently, he had a supplementary exam.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.070
Oh...

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.990
Ubugawa High Volleyball Club

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.700
All right!

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.240
Fukurodani

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.480
Once we're done with our warm ups,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.000
we'll regroup and the teams will play each other in rotation.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.910
Right.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.390
The team who loses their set will do a penalty lap of diving drills around the court.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.170
a lap of diving drills around the court.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.470
Diving?

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.360
They're going to act like they're diving to receive a ball.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.100
They'll slide across the floor on their chests, with their arms stretched out in front of them.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.840
Take a look at the match line-up over there.
Hey, was that guy with Nekoma the last time

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.480
You should be up against Shinzen first.
we had a practice match with them?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.060
Got it.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.880
The one who's staring hard at us?

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.520
Yeah.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.450
No... I don't think so.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.670
Hey, stop sulking.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.330
I can understand that you're in a hurry, but...

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.710
There are some flowers you only see when you take detours.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.340
I don't really get it, but that's awesome!

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.920
It means you should be thankful for your failing grade,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.000
because now you get to ride with me.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.910
Whoops.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.600
So you like volleyball so much that you're that concerned about it.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.790
Yes!

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.200
Why did you start playing volleyball, Shoyo?

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.370
When I was in grade school, I saw the spring tournament on TV!

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.200
It was right when Karasuno was playing, and...

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.280
I saw the Little Giant!

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.410
You saw the Little Giant, or something?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.770
Ha, so I was right?

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.750
Saeko-nesan, you know the Little Giant?

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.520
I think I actually went to school with him.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.220
What?!

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.510
But I never spoke to him.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.120
I might have known him better if he was the mischievous type and stood out.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.880
Were you like the sort of person who's friends with all the bad guys, Ne-san?

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.840
Pretty much, yeah.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.800
But...

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.420
I happened to catch one of their practice matches one time,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.200
than any of the scary-looking people I knew.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.530
But more than scary, he was intense.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.020
You mean the way he'd spike the ball?

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.660
No...

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.730
Maybe he wasn't feeling his best at the time,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.080
but he was being switched out.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.910
Karasuno                  Yugama

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.430
He's what you guys call an ace, right?

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.150
The absolute pride and confidence of being the ace...

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.890
You could see that rising up from his body.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.280
Actually, I almost fell for the guy.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.820
So when the ace is in action,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.140
everyone around him acts

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.280
like they aren't gonna let him do all the work.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.840
Ne-san, you know a lot about the Little Giant.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.220
Not really! I just happened to see some of his matches.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.740
You were awake, huh?

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.710
Well, I was hungry.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.290
So you just follow your instincts.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.170
Yes.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.280
...we won't get weaker just because you watched us.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.300
The absolute pride and confidence of being the ace...

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.230
All right, it's just a little farther.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.570
I'm flooring it!

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.480
#7!
Karasuno       Fukurodani One!

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.720
Nishinoya, nice receive!

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.740
Left! Left!

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.780
Damn it!

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.500
Karasuno       Fukurodani

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.680
As we suspected, they're very strong.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.460
Yeah.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.030
One lap of diving drills!

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.510
Right!

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.710
It's not that we're not on top of it.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.480
This is just what it means to be a team that competes in the nationals.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.630
Nice serve!

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.730
Damn it, Tarako!

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.050
Their arms are gonna snap off!

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.190
Everyone on that team is very strong server.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.670
The manager from Ubugawa mentioned that.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.360
They put their all into their serves.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.900
Yeah...

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.990
I think it's a bit harsh how to have to do a hundred serves at the end of their practices.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.120
One more! Nice serve!

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.080
Ubugawa High School's serves are their ultimate attacks.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.080
Ubugawa High School (Kanagawa)

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.260
But once we're able to return that serve... Bring it!

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.220
Whoa! They're all moving at once?!

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.890
Too bad, I'm actually over here!

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.770
That was an amazing combo.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.390
Th-There are people jumping up everywhere.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.150
I can't tell who's going to hit it.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.650
Yeah!

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.490
They are indeed the masters of using combos.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.620
Shinzen High School (Saitama)
Shinzen High School.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.480
And then we have our destined rivals... Yaku-san!

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.210
Those are some excellent receives, as usual.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.480
The school that's known to pick up the ball, connect,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.090
and wait for the perfect chance to counterattack:

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.170
Nekoma High School (Tokyo)
Nekoma High School.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.130
Two blockers!

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.100
And... Sorry, cover me!

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.390
Got it!

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.060
Akaashi!

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.810
Just like Ushiwaka, Bokuto-san!

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.730
he's one of the top five aces heading to nationals.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:16.470
Tsukki!

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.290
Damn it, Kenma! Don't run away!

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.450
But my arms are gonna break off... They won't!

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.910
We're very thankful...

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.970
All right! I'm so awesome!

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.660
Hey, hey, hey!

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.180
school whose powerful team is lead by a powerful ace to compete in nationals:

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.380
Fukurodani Academy (Tokyo)

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.380
Fukurodani Academy.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.340
To be able to take on such amazing teams... Yeah.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.890
However, this is no time to be scared of how strong our opponents are.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.340
We have to be on the same level as these guys.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.280
Karasuno Ubugawa All right!

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.950
One lap of diving drills!

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.320
Right!

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.200
How many times have they lost already?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.600
They're not exactly weak, just sorta... mediocre.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.000
Who are the first-years that Nekoma had such a hard time with?

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.080
Maybe Nekoma was exaggerating.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.920
Calm down, Hitoka-chan. There, there.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.380
It's okay.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.220
If what Tanaka said was true, it shouldn't be much longer...

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.730
Hey, they're still at it.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.760
We totally made it. Not bad at all.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.320
Ne-san!

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.750
Wait, that's your sister?

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.020
No, she's Ryu's sister.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.320
Now that you mention it, they do look alike.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.980
Glad they made it in one piece.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.840
So the stars are showing up fashionably late?

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.660
How annoying.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:14.940
Haikyu!!

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.980
Nice serve!

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.550
Nice receive!

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.480
Hey, what was that?
All right!

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.320
So fast... I've never seen a quick attack like that.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.210
We're stopping the next one!

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.160
Right!

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.610
Nice serve!

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.760
Sorry! Cover me!

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.120
Eikichi, I'm counting on you!

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.460
Wow, nice serve! Not bad!

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.590
Nice, Hinata!

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.050
Eikichi! Stop their #10!

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.600
Shinzen       Karasuno Damn it!

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.030
I managed to tap it, but I couldn't control it.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.060
What the hell is up with their #9 and #10's quick attack?!

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.070
Don't act all cool, you tardy test flunkers.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.750
One lap of diving drills!

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.280
Right!

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.360
So in our ninth set, we finally got a win.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.240
We finally don't have to do the diving drills.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.750
I'm starving!

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.220
Nice serve!

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.610
Looks like it's Ubugawa High versus Nekoma over there.
Yaku-san, nice receive!

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.380
Given the time, that might be the last game today.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.660
Yeah.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.140
In the second half, they were able to keep up with that quick attack.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.500
Date Tech,

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.270
Seijoh, and Inuoka from Nekoma.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:48.880
Apparently that quick attack won't keep working on strong opponents after all.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.860
Yaku-san! Nice receive!

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.200
Huh?

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.190
Inuoka's on the sideline?

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:55.230
One blocker!

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.820
Go, Lev!

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.010
All right!

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.430
A swing like a whip?

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.640
Wow... That #11...

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.810
At first glance, it's hard to tell because he's slouching,

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.200
but he's pretty big. He might be over 190 cm.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.760
His arms and legs are so long.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.230
Who the heck is he?

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.360
Nekoma Ubugawa All right!

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.520
Seriously, who the hell are

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.580
that shrimpy middle blocker and setter from Karasuno?

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.420
They were completely toying with you.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.520
Shut up! Take a look at their quick attack up close!

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.540
You wouldn't know what the heck was going on!

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.710
Man, this year looks like it's gonna be interesting.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:52.590
Good job!

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.390
Your quick was as amazing as ever, Shoyo.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.900
But at this rate, nothing's going to change.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.940
Nothing's changed since then.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.430
I came here to get stronger.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.510
Hey! Who the heck is that middle blocker?

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.120
Oh...

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.830
That's the first-year, Haiba Lev.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.360
He's half Russian and half Japanese.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.250
H-Half?! So cool!

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.700
L-Le...

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.430
Lev. What does it mean in Russian again? Tiger?

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.340
It means lion! Yup, lion!

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.550
He wasn't there last time, right?

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.300
Yeah. Lev started volleyball in high school.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.940
When we went to Karasuno around Golden Week, he still hadn't played very much,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.070
and only the regular members went.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.020
He just started and he can play like that?!

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.530
Yeah. And when we were paired together, it was really difficult.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.530
No matter how hard I tried, our timing was off.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.470
I'm used to it now, though.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.410
Huh...

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.040
Kenma-san couldn't stop sighing.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.320
I guess there are times when even you can't read people, Kenma.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.710
Lev is just too special.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.580
Right now, he's mostly working with his innate physical abilities and instincts,

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.800
and his height.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.560
Yeah, his height totally isn't fair!

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.600
I want some!

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.310
He's been blessed with too much!

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.680
But I'm not gonna lose!

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.070
Well, he's a powerful asset, honest, and not a bad guy.

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:25.140
Though he's too honest at times.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.040
Oh, but his passing basics are still completely bad.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.910
He's worse than you, Shoyo.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.900
His serves are worse than yours, too, Shoyo.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.420
Am I the the guideline of what's bad or not, Kenma?

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.490
Kenma's actually talking without being shy.
But you are bad.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.800
Yeah.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.790
Haiba... Haiba Lev, huh...

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.750
Western-style names are so cool!

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:57.180
R-Russian! A Russian greeting! Russian!

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.390
Karasuno's #10.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.070
Japanese?!

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.930
Oh, sorry. I can't speak Russian.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.790
I was born and raised in Japan.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.340
I see! Hey, how tall are you?

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.110
I'm Hinata Shoyo, a first-year.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.360
It was 194 centimeters the last time I checked.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.430
I'm Haiba Lev, a first-year.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.610
194! So cool!

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.780
You're even smaller up close, Hinata.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.720
What'd you say?! Huh?!

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.960
Men's Bathroom

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.960
S-Sorry! I didn't mean anything bad by it.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.410
But you have no problem jumping this high, do you?

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.920
I saw that earlier in the match.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.390
But I can jump even higher than that.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.020
Men's Bathroom

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.160
Ow...

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.280
Then I'll jump even higher! Past that, to the very top!

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.690
Your spikes were really cool, since you didn't seem to care

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.180
if there were blockers there or not.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.900
Yeah, well...

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.580
I'm Nekoma's ace.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.860
But if I actually said that, Taketora-san would get really mad at me.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:18.760
Wha? You don't call a guy who can barely guard an ace!

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.600
But you're a middle blocker like me, right?

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.720
Center, right?

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.680
Aces are usually like the mohawk guy on your team, the wing spikers, right?

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.640
Do position names have anything to do with it?

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.120
The one who's able to score the most points is the ace, right?

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.030
Simple as that.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.030
Well, see you tomorrow.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.120
I'll be the first one to stop your quick tomorrow, Hinata.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.350
"The one who's able to score the most points is the ace."

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.060
With their own hands...

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.890
Ubugawa Karasuno Bring it!

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.570
All right!

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.270
Karasuno looks a lot calmer than they were during Golden Week.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.340
Not to mention, they've got their #10's usual quick attack.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.690
Yeah. It does seem that they're much more stable overall.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.000
But are you content with that, Karasuno?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.740
You lost with the power you have right now, didn't you?

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.000
That's why you came here.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.920
To become stronger, right?

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.720
All right! Our opponents still aren't able to counter you weird quick attack,

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.920
so keep on using it!

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.090
Right...

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.860
Need a towel?

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.080
Oh, yeah.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.140
#4!

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.970
It went up! Kenma, cover!

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.110
Left! Left!

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.520
Give it to me!

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.030
All right!

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.240
Nice kill, Lev!

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.270
Sorry for being rude.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.030
I overstepped my bounds.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.000
And I keep telling you not to worry about it.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.960
But if you're asking for a slide hit out of nowhere, I can't always keep up.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.250
So that's called a "slide hit"?!

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.640
That's so cool!

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.730
So that was an unplanned slide hit?!

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.620
Well, I was still able to do it.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.310
I'm Nekoma's ace.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.220
Center ace...

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.100
Kenma! It's your turn to serve!

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.730
We lost in the IH prelims.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.740
What do we need to choose to move forward?

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.310
I'm not sure if it's the proper path,
Kenma-san! One more! Nice serve!

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.880
but we've got new blood flowing through our veins.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:05.380
Does Karasuno want stability in order to achieve more power?

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.010
Or is it...

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.860
evolution?

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.050
Lev's finally blending in with the team.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.250
Yeah, even though it's little by little.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.450
That's not true!

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.480
Oh? Do you feel like you're not quite there yet?

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.930
I'm already an indispensable part of the team! The ace.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.640
You're an ace at not understanding the position you play, maybe.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.490
Episode 5: Greed Next time on Haikyu!! "Greed."
