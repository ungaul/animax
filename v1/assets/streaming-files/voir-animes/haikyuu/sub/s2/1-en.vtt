WEBVTT

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.910
Fly

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.060
A tall, tall wall looms in front of me.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.430
Aoba Johsai                                 Karasuno

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.180
What's the view on the other side?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.980
What does it look like?

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.110
The view from the top...

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.820
it's a view I could never see on my own.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.850
But...

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.250
If I'm not doing it alone...

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420
I just might be able to see it.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.820
Haikyu!!

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.470
Episode 1  Let's Go To Tokyo!!

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.470
Red                White

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.270
Nice receive!

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.230
Here it comes...

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.820
All right! Here I go!

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.570
Yeah!

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.020
Whoo!

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.660
Wh-Whoo...

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.880
Get used to it already.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.130
Daichi-san, nice serve!

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.980
Got it!

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.760
Left!

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.140
Asahi likes his tosses a little... higher.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.650
Chance ball!

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.230
Got it!

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.570
It's coming again.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.080
It's funny how you keep falling for that.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.500
What'd you say?!

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.780
Now, now...

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.440
Nice serve!

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.230
I just can't get it.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.690
Which will it be this time?

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.980
Gah!

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.850
Was that Rolling Thunder?!

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.620
Yeah!

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.400
Rolling... Thunder!

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.990
Sorry! I was completely open!

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.170
Rolling Thunder's so cool!
So annoying...

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.880
All right! Let's change things up!

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.440
Yeah!

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.050
Nice serve, Yamaguchi!

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.310
Hinata!

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.270
We're gonna stop it!

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.770
Nice cover!

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.020
Red White All right!

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.540
All right. That's enough for today.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.750
Let us play one more set, please!

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.140
Huh?

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.210
Please!

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.860
Guys, playing until you drop isn't the answer.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.250
Captain, you need to tell these guys―

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.230
You guys...

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.480
Miyagi Prefecture Karasuno High School

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480
Red                White

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.660
I haven't practiced hitting enough... Not yet.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.280
Kageyama! You can still go, right?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.480
Give me some tosses!

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.460
Right.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.700
You guys are still gonna practice?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.340
Hey! We've still got to clean up,
They're all definitely realizing their own potential,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.800
so that's enough for today!

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.910
but what our team lacks is experience.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.830
Right...

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.180
Ow, ow! Hey, Nishinoya!
Hey, make sure you cool down properly.
They definitely haven't had enough practice matches with other teams.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.370
Ow!

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.590
I can't count on the neighborhood association being able to show up.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.540
What should I do?

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.870
Sensei?
Take-chan?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.900
You okay?

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.000
W-We're going, right?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.120
Where?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.510
Your nose is bleeding!

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.720
Tokyo!

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.180
Tokyo?

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.640
Tokyo?

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.320
You mean... Volleyball Team (Boys)

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.490
Nekoma?!

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.400
Gross!

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.610
Tissue!

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.240
A practice match?

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.260
Yeah! But it won't just be Nekoma this time.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.180
The Fukurodani Academy Group.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.310
It's a group of schools from the Kanto region that includes Nekoma.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.930
Apparently, they hold practice matches all the time.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.910
This time, because of Coach Nekomata,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.480
Karasuno will also be able to participate in their practice matches.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.320
Groups like that are created through relationships built up over years,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.750
so it's not easy to get in without connections.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.320
We've got to make sure to thank Coach Nekomata.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.560
And Sensei, too, who I'm sure kept persistently asking him.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.710
No, I didn't, really...

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.730
Your name helped a lot, Coach Ukai.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.790
Thank you!

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.800
Over the years, we've lost our connections with other schools in the prefecture

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.470
that we were once close with.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.540
There are many schools where the coaches

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.810
that were once close to the former Coach Ukai are now gone.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.020
We shouldn't miss this chance!

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.390
Yeah!

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.210
I'm going to be able to see that set up in person again.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.990
Maybe I caught a cold... I'm getting chills.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.240
Hey! We're right before a match!

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.700
This time, I'm going to protect us 'til we win!

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.440
Yeah... It might actually be a little cold today.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.710
You, too, Yaku-san?!

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.110
We're gonna take down that City Boy Alliance!

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.470
City Boy... ...Alliance?

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.270
I'm feeling hot! I'm burning up!

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.930
Yamamoto, shut up.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.270
This time, I'm going to break through for sure!

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.760
Um, the only thing is,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.160
their prelims for the Inter-High start this weekend,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160
so it won't be right away.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.280
Also, at this point, we've only received the invitation.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.680
There are some agreements we have to work out,

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.800
but I'll tell you all about the details another time.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.750
But it seems that all of you are... Of course!

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.500
We'll go!

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.740
I've got a staff meeting, so I've got to get going.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.140
Ukai-kun, I'll leave the rest to you.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:00.730
Sure.
Thank you!

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.870
It's going to get busy.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.040
Yeah.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.460
You'll be busy, too, Shimizu.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.090
This'll be your first long trip with us.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.360
I'll do my best, too.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.520
Come on! Hurry and clean up, then go home!

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.740
Right!

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.030
Thanks for the food!

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.150
I wonder who it is.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.890
Maybe she's a third-year.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.380
So pretty... What? What's happening?

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.680
Shimizu-senpai!

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.870
Hinata knows the hot third-year?!

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.170
Wh-What are you doing h-here... Hey, Hinata?

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.360
Do you know any first-years who aren't in a club?

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.870
Aoba Johsai High School Oikawa Toru (Third-Year)

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.370
Oikawa's featured in Monthly Volleyball,

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.830
and it even has his picture.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.270
Well, he's good enough to play in a national league.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.950
So, what does it say?

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.010
Um...

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.340
"Oikawa's favorite food is milk bread.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.020
His favorite saying is, 'If you're going to hit it, hit it until it breaks.'"

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.380
What the hell is that?

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.260
Who cares? That's completely useless!

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:41.620
Third-Years Remain to Take Down Shiratorizawa

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.280
Looks like Seijoh wants to take down Shiratorizawa,

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.620
so most of the third-years that were regulars are still there.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.730
Come on and bring it, Seijoh!

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.900
Bring it!

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.700
Hey! You're gonna rip it!

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:49.910
For crying out loud...

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.130
The Reigning Champions of Tohoku
Shiratorizawa Academy Ushijima Wakatoshi (3rd Year) Wing Spiker
Hey, it's Ushiwaka.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.080
Japan?

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.280
Hey! Get out here already.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.600
We're going for a run.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.640
Hey... Ushiwaka's in the Youth World.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.930
What?

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.320
Youth World?

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.600
Simply put, he's representing Japan in the under 19 age group.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.310
Only one high school can represent Miyagi in the spring tournament.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.070
For us to go to nationals,

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.350
we'll have to defeat Ushiwaka and Oikawa.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.910
All right! Let's go running!

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.790
Right!

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.420
Faculty Room

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.840
Quiz Name: Tanaka Ryunosuke Year 2 Class 1
Quiz Name: Nishinoya Yu Year 2 Class 3

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.100
This is reality.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.430
I need to accept it, and think rationally...

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.000
It'll be okay.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.700
Those kids have plenty of guts, so they'll be able to do this.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.100
They can do it if they try.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.100
They can do it if—

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:03.450
They can do it if they try. They can do it if they try.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.300
Takeda-sensei?!

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.260
Here we are.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.460
Karasuno's famous Heartbreak Hill.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.910
All right! Ten dashes uphill to the halfway mark!

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:17.920
Two at a time!

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.420
Ready...

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.540
Ready...

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.640
Tsukishima! Run like you mean it!

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.180
Ready...

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.890
Ready...

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.030
Ready...

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.900
Hey, good job, Tsukishima.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.850
Hey! Where are you guys going?!

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.510
Pretty sure we can just let them go.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.540
Nitwit. Nitwit. Ntwit.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.600
No one's behind us.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.240
You totally went the wrong way somewhere, didn't you?

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.940
That'd be you, dumbass!

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.510
Where are we?

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.720
Wakano 3-chome?

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.650
Isn't Wakano near Shiratorizawa?

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.680
Shiratorizawa? You mean Ushiwaka's school?

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.640
Did you need something from me?

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.690
Japan!

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.450
Japan!

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.720
If you don't need anything, I'll be leaving.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.960
We came from Karasuno!

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.400
Would you mind if we did some recon at Shiratorizawa?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.090
Is he serious?!

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.520
Aren't you supposed to recon in secret?

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.940
Karasuno...

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.860
The team that uses that weird quick attack?

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.990
Do as you like.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.790
No matter what your abilities may be,

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.750
we won't get weaker just because you watched us.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.280
I'm heading back to school now.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.420
If you want to look, follow me.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.380
If you can keep up.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.520
Of course we're going.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.200
We're going to defeat you at the spring tournament.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.450
Of course we'll watch.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.320
Yeah.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.630
Are you out doing roadwork by yourself?

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.860
Everyone else is just slow.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.590
They're back there somewhere.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.240
Kageyama!

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.840
Don't you dare get a head start!

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.660
You're just slow!

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.870
As expected, he runs at a fast pace.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.120
Holy crap!

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.800
I'm super excited! Whoo!

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.830
Calm down, dumbass! Are you a dog?

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.320
Are you out for your first walk, you idiot?!

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.510
Shiratorizawa Academy

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.810
It's so big!

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.340
Their school building looks so cool!

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.640
It looks like a hotel!

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.850
What's with this super-huge athletic field?!

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.020
Management Center Parking Lot
Indoor Practice Area | Baseball Field Golf Practice Area Tennis Courts
Whoa! This place is so big they need signs!

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.780
Kageyama! Horses!

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.780
They have horses!

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.510
The volleyball team has its own bus!

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.320
Hey. Don't get lost.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.030
I won't!

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.150
We've lost sight of Ushiwaka-san!

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.360
Then we're lost!

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.550
This looks like it might be the volleyball team's gym...

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.520
Yeah.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.610
Hey, can you see Ushiwaka?

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.560
Shut up! Don't push!

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.020
Huh?

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.290
Isn't that another school?

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.730
Is it a practice match? Who are they playing?

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.480
Aren't those college students?

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.550
College?!

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:58.040
Well, no other high school in the prefecture stands a chance against Shiratorizawa.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.240
They'd have to go out of the prefecture

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.960
or have a college team come in for it to even count as practice.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.490
Curse you, Japan!

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.890
Took you long enough.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.450
I'm Kageyama from Karasuno High.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.010
Would you mind if I had a look?

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.770
Kageyama...

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:15.720
From Kitagawa-Daiichi.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.480
Yes. I applied for this school, but wasn't accepted.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.520
That's not surprising.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.940
I remember seeing one of your matches from junior high.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.400
We don't need a setter who can't serve the ace at this school.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.960
True. You're not really one to serve anyone.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.570
What?!

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.240
But that goes the same for the Great King, too.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.360
He is the top setter in the prefecture, after all.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.790
Oikawa-san has nothing to do with this!

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.400
Oikawa...

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.440
He is an efficient player.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.250
He should have come to our school.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.220
Are you saying that Oikawa-san would have been able to serve you?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.360
No matter where he is,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.260
Oikawa is a setter that can bring the absolute best out of his team.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.790
If the team's absolute best is still weak, there's nothing more to be done.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.890
If it's strong, he'll make it as strong as possible.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.640
That is his ability.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.140
A sapling must have good soil in order to grow strong.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.610
Infertile soil will not bring forth splendid fruit.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.140
Infertile soil?

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.330
What do you mean?

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.330
Other than Oikawa, everyone at Aoba Johsai is weak.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.920
That's what I mean.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.640
Weak...

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.110
If Seijoh is infertile soil,

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.840
are we concrete or something?

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.360
He's usually pretty scared of strong players he's meeting for the first time.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.780
I apologize if I hit a nerve,

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:06.520
but words from someone who lost to Aoba Johsai and couldn't even stay in the prefectural finals

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.000
mean nothing to me.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.010
He...

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.610
I'm Hinata Shoyo, from the concrete.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.280
I'm going to beat you, and go to nationals.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.170
Hey, are you from another school?

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.390
You're not allowed to be here.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.080
Thank you for showing us around.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.210
We'll be going now.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:19.940
Um...

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.860
If Oikawa-san is the best setter in the prefecture,

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.300
I'm the one who is going to surpass him.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.740
If you'll excuse me.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.670
Stamina, speed, acceleration,

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.370
vertical jumps, fighting spirit...

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.630
Hinata Shoyo.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.780
Kageyama Tobio.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.200
Well, in truth,

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:06.280
we are a team that couldn't beat Seijoh, who in turn couldn't beat Shiratorizawa.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.970
That doesn't matter, as long as we beat both of them.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.790
We seem to be on the same page.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.590
That's why we're going to Tokyo.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:17.290
It's best to go up against strong guys if you want to get stronger.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.470
Ahem...

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.600
As for our series of away games in Tokyo,

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.930
for the time being, it's planned for next month.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.000
Because they are away games,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.450
we will need permission from your parents or guardians,

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.280
so I'll hand out those forms later.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.360
We also have tentative consent from the school, as well.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.360
However,

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.530
as you are aware,

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.570
you have final exams starting next month.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.060
Right?

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.630
So, I think you know what I'm getting at,

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.380
but if you fail any subjects,

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.600
supplementary classes will be held that weekend.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.760
Which means you won't be able to go to the away games.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.400
What happens if we skip our final exams?

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.240
Supplementary exams.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.350
Then what happens if you skip those?

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.320
Supplementary exams for the supplementary exams?

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.200
I know! We'll just take the tests after the away games!

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.330
If you try to feign being sick, you won't be able to go to the away games, either.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.430
You have my condolences.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.040
Episode 2: Direct Sunlight

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.630
Next time on Haikyu!!: "Direct Sunlight."
