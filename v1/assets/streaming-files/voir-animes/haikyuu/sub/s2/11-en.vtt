WEBVTT

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.780
Akaashi...

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.970
Don't toss to me anymore!

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.750
All right.
Huh?

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.920
Then please calm down in the time that I'm not tossing to you.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.680
I don't know what's going on,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.450
but their ace doesn't seem to be doing well.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.670
Let's keep it up!

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.540
Yeah!

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.400
Haikyu!!

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.510
Episode 11: "Above"

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.250
All right!

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.020
Nice kill!

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.230
Yeah!

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.490
All right!

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.610
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.610
M-Maybe I'm just imagining it,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.070
but it doesn't seem like Fukurodani is fazed at all.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.080
Yeah...

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.320
Chance ball!

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.500
Here.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.210
Right now, there are two attackers in Fukurodani's front line.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.670
Is it going to be a quick from the center,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.710
an attack from the back,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.920
or is their #4 finally going to do something again?

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.100
A dump!

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.060
Karasuno           Fukurodani

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.320
Fukurodani's turning the tables again.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.060
And the ace hasn't even hit anything!

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.030
Bokuto may look like the big brother,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.270
but he's actually the baby of the family.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.270
Nice, Akaashi!

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.850
Thank you.
He is pretty amazing on his own, though.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.380
Nice receive!

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.360
We're used to Bokuto's slumps.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.620
The slightest thing can bring him up or down.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.620
Left!

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.870
Oh, for crying out loud...

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.360
All right!

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.830
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.830
Fukurodani match point!

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.130
Just one more point!

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.400
Apparently Fukurodani isn't a team that Bokuto pulls,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.260
but is a team where all of the other members pull Bokuto.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.380
One touch!

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.440
We now know that Fukurodani is not Bokuto-san's one-man team.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.150
And yet...

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.780
There's still no one scarier on their own than Bokuto-san!

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.730
Totally shut out!

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.080
All right! Just one more point to a deuce!

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.730
Karasuno Fukurodani Wow... Well done.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.060
If I mess up this serve, the match will be over.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.060
I'm...

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.080
...definitely getting this one in!

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.290
Komi-yan!

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.000
Yeah!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.330
Nice receive!

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.010
I'm sure Karasuno's figured out what kind of team we are by now.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.470
Which means... Their attention is off of the ace.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.190
And Bokuto-san wants to hit so bad that he's getting restless!

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.070
We'll give you the good part...

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.650
...so...

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.080
...pick yourself back up... ...ace!

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.090
Karasuno                    Fukurodani

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.600
If you would.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.560
Leave it to us.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.720
Whoo! Ace!

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.130
You're so cool!

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.690
Nothing beats the ace in the end!

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.740
Birds of prey!

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.510
Your hair's like a great horned owl!

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.370
I'm the best after all!

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.450
Hey, hey, hey!

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.340
Hey, hey, hey...

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.960
He's able to pick himself up so quickly.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.300
That's what they call a simpleton.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.470
The ace's weakness brings out the others' strengths,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.490
and, at the same time,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.370
becomes a strong root for the team that's hard to break.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.930
Apparently, this is another form of strength.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.390
To be honest,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.110
I was thinking we might be okay if we were able to stop Bokuto-kun,

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.690
but I guess that was naïve.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.780
The reason he's able to be that free and selfish,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.490
and the reason the others are able to ignore that,

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.160
Aren't I awesome, Akaashi?!
must be because of how much they trust each other.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.450
For sure, Bokuto-san.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.390
Our team isn't at the point where any of them can be that selfish yet.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.130
I'm sorry!

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.840
My last serve ended up being an "I freaked out, so please attack," serve!

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.050
If you can figure that out on your own, you're well off.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.280
In that situation, how much one is going to get blamed

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.600
will affect our ability to win.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.500
No one wants the game to end because of their mistake.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.840
He must be talking about you.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.160
Shut up.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.530
But there's no one who tries to hold back a winning serve.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.610
Right!

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.190
Now that it's over, that was definitely our loss,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.940
but there's one thing that's for sure...

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.880
Your plays will be effective at a national level of competition.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.320
Right now, your serves and combinations

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.910
can't match the other teams'.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.230
Because you started so late on them, it can't be helped.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.810
But you mustn't stop.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.690
You mustn't think that this is the limit of your power.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.300
When you mix colors, they become muddled and dirty, right?

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.820
But once you finish mixing, you get the color black,

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.850
which won't be overtaken by any other.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.300
Please make our team's color black, which fits us crows.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.920
W-Was that metaphor a bit hard to understand?

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.170
No! Thank you very much!

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.790
Thank you very much!

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.340
All right. This is gonna be our final training camp penalty...

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.340
One lap of diving drills!

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.640
Right!

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.290
Asahi-san!

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.100
There's still a little time left,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.400
so could you hit some of my tosses?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.910
Oh, sure.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.900
Noya-san! Let me hit some, too.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.920
Yeah! Sure thing, Ryu!

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.360
Oh, me, too.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.080
Ah! Are you going to toss some up for us, too?

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.980
Thanks!

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.340
Oh, no, no.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.590
I'm going to hit some.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.490
Damn it. If our quick was just a little more complete,

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.550
we might have been able to get a set from Fukurodani.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.860
But now we can fight.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.220
Even if they read us or catch up to us...

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.310
We can fight!

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.920
That all depends on my tosses.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.180
You'll get it eventually, so it'll be fine.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.150
Don't decide things for me!

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.590
So you're saying you won't be able to?

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.400
Of course I'll be able to, dumbass!

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.750
So you can!

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.620
Let's go practice that quick!

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.660
You can actually feel how stupid they are from that conversation.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.660
Yeah!

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.850
As soon as we get back, we have the first spring tournament prelims.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.790
Yeah. If we're going to come here again, it'll be after that.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.040
I wonder if it'll be cooler by then.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.120
There'll still be some lingering summer heat.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.350
What's wrong, Suga?

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.080
If we don't make it through,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.800
the three of us won't be able to come back.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.550
There it is! Negative goatee!

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.020
What the... Of course we're all coming back, dumbass.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.420
You're right. Sorry.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.590
Negativity, begone!

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.190
Ow!

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.230
Actually, you sounded like Kageyama just now.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.480
Dumbass! Hinata, you dumbass!

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.690
You sound just like him!
Do it again!

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.970
I-I feel like I'm getting doubly yelled at.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.910
Huh?

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.760
All right, meat!

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.330
I'm starving!

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.800
Could you take this plate to Miyanoshita-san?

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.430
Sure.
There we go.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.890
Apparently, even Bokuto-san has his bad days.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.760
Yeah. Well, he self-destructs at the most random times.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:48.570
Kalbi, skirt steak, tongue, offals, liver, sirloin, tripe, large intestine...

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.480
But it doesn't bug him if our enemy is strong,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.880
so we're usually okay.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.380
When everyone else on the team loses hope,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.410
he's usually still pretty energetic.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.250
Despite everything, he's pretty reliable.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.240
Bokuto-san!
Oh?

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.400
W-We're not gonna lose in an actual match!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.780
Oh, yeah?! Bring it on, then!

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.100
Before the spring tournament,

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.690
we need to have our meat war, Hinata!

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.420
Ahem.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.130
Well done on the week-long training camp, everyone.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.900
Nothing puts a smile on your face more than filling your stomach with good food!

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.550
Eat all the meat you can.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.230
Thanks for the food!

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.880
So then, Kenma... Hey! Bokuto, you bastard!

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.910
Don't you steal my meat, you jerk!

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.760
Have a riceball.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.730
Oh, thank you.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.680
What?!

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.680
You understand, don't you, Ryu?

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.870
Of course.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:56.780
Tora.
Yes, Master.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.640
Don't you dare let any of them try to use this opportunity

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.980
to get closer to Kiyoko-san.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.430
As you wish!

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.920
Go, go!

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.440
You go.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.960
I wonder why Nishinoya-san's the master.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.430
Apparently, it's because he's the only one

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.280
that's ever been slapped by Shimizu-senpai before.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.380
Ah... Tsukishima!

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.680
You need to eat more!

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.550
Er... I can't eat that much...

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.880
Come on, eat some veggies, too.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.500
You, too, Kenma, damn it!

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.130
Eat some rice!

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.470
You mean meat! Eat some meat, Tsukki!

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.320
Or you won't grow anymore!

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.160
Are they, like, some pushy uncles?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.400
Along with the defiant, hip youngster.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.750
The generals totally see that and are having fun with it.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.480
Hey, Suga-kun.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.040
Hm?

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.550
That girl from Karasuno's acting really strange... Is she okay?

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.440
This is like...

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.640
The titans' jungle!

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.220
I smell meat... I want some so bad!

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.180
Hey, is this ready to eat?!

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.470
But if I carelessly stormed in there, I might be eaten by accident!
Hey, I was planning on eating that!

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.000
They might barbecue me by accident!

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.200
Can you reach? Would you like me to get you something?

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.470
I promise I don't taste good!

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.960
Er, I mean... I'm fine! Thanks!

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.470
I was thinking about eating this.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.040
Huh? Oh.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.140
S-So good... It tastes like life.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.000
Ya-chan... The one you ate right now

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.900
was really charred. You okay?

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.490
Want some tea?

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.110
There's water, too.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.820
It looks pretty dangerous over there.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.040
Yeah... They'd probably get the cops called on them if this was in the city.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.110
I definitely don't want them surrounding me.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.300
I'd rather have them surround me.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.090
How much are you going to eat?

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.100
The third-years in Karasuno all seem pretty mature.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:15.230
Our Fukurodani managers are already top tier,

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.650
but combined with the Karasuno managers, they've gone up even higher!

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:19.980
What do you think?

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.900
I cannot argue.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.370
Our ace is weak-willed, though.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.910
What? Really?

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.950
Even though he looks that scary?

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.950
Though I think that's still better than our simpleton ace...

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.210
What?!

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.380
You're in the nation's top five?!

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.200
That's awesome!

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.980
Right? Right?!

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:42.240
But Ushiwaka's from your area, and he's in the top three.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.100
Top three?!

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.840
Hey! If you say that, it knocks me down!

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.860
Top three means there's two others, right?

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.620
Ushiwaka from the Tohoku region, Kiryu from Kyushu,

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.920
and Sakusa from Kanto.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.520
They are this year's top three high school aces.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.630
Ooh...

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.950
Of course, one of them had to be in Miyagi.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.810
Hey, Tsukki!

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.520
You've been practicing with my spikes,

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.840
so you're not allowed to freak out about Ushiwaka!

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.660
Could you please not call me "Tsukki"?

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.860
But just because the aces are the top three,

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.660
doesn't mean that their teams are, as well.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.760
Yeah! Yeah!

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.940
Though Itachiyama where Sakusa plays is the top pick to win nationals.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.660
Then... ...if we beat them, we'll be number one?

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.930
You talk big, for being the top two for sucking.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.040
Hinata must be number one.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.470
Kenma said that my serves and receives were better!

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:44.500
D'oh!

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.610
Nekomata-sensei.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.410
Again, thank you very much for inviting us.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:56.860
You never could stop my spikes, Tsukki!
It appears their change happened because we came here.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.800
No, no. It looks like we got some good motivation,
Lev, you got a cat out of a tree?

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.580
Kenma-san's arms were too short to reach.
so it goes both ways.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:09.140
In six months, none of these teams will be the same.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.130
They'll be new teams with different members.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.280
Man, I'm stuffed!

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.620
They don't know of any matches without regrets...
Ah, so the prelims are later in Tokyo...

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.020
Well, we have a lot of schools.
Well, I don't, at least.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.190
But all I can do is hope that they get to play without any regrets,

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.940
and I'll do my best so they're able to do that.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.300
Right.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.350
I hate being weak, but... Huh?

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.590
Knowing that there are so many players better than me...

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.800
...makes me feel so excited!

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.720
Well, see ya next time.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.930
Yeah, see you next time.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.620
The summer vacation training camp away games...

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.590
...are now over.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:26.460
Haikyu!!

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:34.300
The Japanese National High School Volleyball Tournament Miyagi Prefecture Qualifier First Preliminaries (Boys) Lineup

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.500
If we can win twice at the prelims tomorrow,

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.310
we'll go to the qualifiers in October to decide the representative team.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.580
The eight schools that make it through the first prelims

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.390
will be joined by eight more powerhouse schools,

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.470
and they'll play the tournament that decides the representative team in October.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.240
There are only two games in the first prelims?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.090
We were able to make it into the top sixteen at the Inter-High,

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.220
so we're exempt from the first games.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.570
Wow! We're awesome!

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.100
All right! Let's start our calisthenics!
S-S-So we're finally playing o-official matches...

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.410
Right!

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.720
I-I'm getting nervous... One, two, three, four...

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.260
Well, it is your first tournament, isn't it, Hitoka-chan?

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.040
Five, six, seven, eight... Yup.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.170
One, two, three, four... Well, for us...

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.290
Five, six, seven, eight... It's our last.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:16.400
One, two, three, four... Five, six, seven, eight...

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.830
Sorry, sorry! Don't get all teary-eyed.

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.430
I-I'm not! A mosquito just flew into my eye!

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.430
A mosquito?!

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.860
Bring it!

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.280
Don't hit to the libero, don't hit to the libero...

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.270
Don't hit to the libero...

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.950
Why is it whenever I think that, that's exactly where it goes?

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.640
Yamaguchi, nice serve!

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.430
It was hard to get!

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.410
Oh, right...

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.040
He totally got it, though.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.380
One more time!

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.430
What are you concentrating so hard on, Sensei?

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.590
Oh, Ukai-kun.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.720
Well... our first-years are amazing,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.740
but I was just thinking there are so many other amazing first-years...

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.350
Yeah.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.370
Kakugawa Academy That guy, huh?

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.770
Yeah...

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:10.940
I'm home.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.970
Whoa, Kei.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.940
You grew even taller.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.620
You totally passed me a long time ago.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.210
Ni-chan.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.200
Hey, it's been a while.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.620
It's been so long since I've talked to you.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.770
Has it?

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.480
Even when I come home, other than when we're eating,

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.400
you just stay in your room.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.670
Do I?

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.480
Your expression has changed a bit.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.550
You went to the away games, right? Was it a rough trip?

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.460
I-It was normal...

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.430
You've got "rough" written all over your face!

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.370
You're still playing volleyball, aren't you?

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.470
Yeah, I'm on a team.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.190
Do you guys have tournaments?

00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:59.450
Yeah, we do.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.470
You want to know why I'm still playing after what happened in high school, right?

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.460
It's...

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.840
...because of what happened in high school.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:21.130
Karasuno Volleyball Club

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.980
Even now, when I think back on it, it's seriously frustrating,

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.600
and I can't even think of it as a good experience.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.620
Not to mention, you ended up seeing how pathetic I was.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.520
I didn't do anything in high school.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.650
I didn't get to experience any of the good things in volleyball.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.900
But I already found out

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.240
how great it feels to get a spike in,

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.700
the pride you feel when you hear the cheers...

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.940
It all depends on if you have that moment or not.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.540
I want to be in a place where I can do my best until I'm satisfied.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.540
Right...

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.920
I see.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.970
Ukai

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.930
You have a match tomorrow, don't you?

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.390
That's probably enough, then!

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.650
One more! Just one more!

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.360
We'll finish after this one!

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.740
Please!

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.300
Hey, I've never seen that tall kid before.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.300
Just one more.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.280
Thanks!

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.880
He said he didn't get enough practice today
All right, Hinata! We're going to nail this!

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.320
and begged to use our courts until we started.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.220
Yeah!

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.880
Let's go!

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.130
I know!

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.140
Apparently he's the setter from Sho-chan's school.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.630
Huh... Here we go!

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.190
I've been watching for a while,

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.460
but they keep messing up.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.600
Hey, Aone, did you grow even taller?!

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.400
Oh, my. You're here again, Kamasaki-san?
Date Tech Are you that bored?

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.470
Is finding a job going okay?

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.130
Aren't your sleeves rolled up too far?

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.430
Futakuchi, you bastard!

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.080
You should be more respectful to your elders!

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.450
Hey, Kunimi.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.420
Is it true about Oikawa-san?

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:09.990
Probably?

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.580
He always goes to extremes.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.560
Huh? Torino?

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.150
It's Karasuno.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.340
Where's that? Never heard of it.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.520
If you've got the strength to beat Shiratorizawa,

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.550
you can beat any school in the prefecture.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.650
Simple as that.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.150
The Greater Serves for the Lesser

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.820
I'm Hinata Shoyo, from the concrete.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.630
I'm going to beat you,

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.120
and go to nationals.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.980
One more!

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.040
August 11th.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.810
The Japanese National High School Volleyball Tournament,

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.680
otherwise known as the High School Spring Tournament.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.580
The first preliminaries of the Miyagi Qualifiers

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.300
start today!

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.820
There are times you can tell who's gonna win

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.520
