00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.320
Dear Mom...

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.190
The weather in Tokyo is cool, but hotter than the Tohoku region.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.200
Today is the third day of the week-long training camp.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.540
We're almost at the turning point.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.730
Go!

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.890
It's hot!

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.170
No saying "hot!"

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.130
It appears that everyone is nearly exhausted.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.070
It has also been three weeks since Hinata and Kageyama-kun's argument.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.960
Here.
Thanks.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.350
Thank you!

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.470
Even though they're practicing together, they still aren't talking.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.790
All right!
Service ace!

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.860
It's gradual, but it looks like they're making fewer mistakes.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.870
Fukurodani            Karasuno
And they narrow the point gap with every set they play.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.540
I am surprised every day by their progress.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.330
I was worried about Tsukishima-kun, who seemed down,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.040
but apparently that's just how he usually looks.
Asahi-san, one more! Nice serve!

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.230
Nice serve!

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.300
Although he must be exhausted, he seems to be playing well.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.670
However...

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.430
Damn it! It was short again!

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.640
All right!
Don't worry about it!

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.710
I'm sorry!

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.960
Hinata and Kageyama-kun's new quick is not working out very well.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.320
At this rate—

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.650
Sorry!

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.500
I hope I'm able to see it work at least once during this training camp.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.790
Thanks.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.430
Haikyu!!

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.010
Episode 09: VS "Umbrella"

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.280
It's their first long series of away games

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.090
and the temperature just keeps rising...

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.290
The going's going to get rough for them right about now.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.270
Center!

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.400
Hinata, get the last!

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.670
Sorry! It was close to the net!

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.140
Damn it!
All right!

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.910
Everyone's gotten better.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.750
It was only for a moment, but even Tsukishima was different.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.020
I'm the only one who hasn't changed.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.520
I don't think I've ever seen Hinata so agitated before.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.260
Yeah...

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.100
Nekoma Karasuno Chance ball!

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.560
Got it!

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.900
It's a chance for a quick... This time, for sure...

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.150
I'll get it!

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.150
Nice cover! Nice cover!

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.740
Well done, Hinata.
Hey!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.700
You held back, didn't you?!

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.080
Held... back?

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.290
Me? With volleyball?

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.680
Say that again.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.680
Hey, come on.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.340
Excuse me. Can we get a time out?

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.090
That wasn't the falling toss.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.380
Huh? It wasn't?

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.500
No idea.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.940
You probably need animal instincts to tell.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.360
It wasn't?

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.650
I mean... Looking back, it technically may not have been...

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.120
I think what just happened is

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.400
that the toss right now wasn't like the falling tosses he's been getting,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.150
but was more of a parabola.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.660
Which means Kageyama was trying Kageyama, calm down.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.080
to get Hinata to hit the ball, no matter what.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.050
Hinata hasn't hit a spike comfortably for a while now.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.030
That's pretty stressful for a spiker.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.660
Kageyama might have subconsciously been worried

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.510
that Hinata's might not play as well because of that.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.040
But, Hinata... Calm down, already!

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.040
I'm impressed that you could tell,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.570
but is that something to get angry about?!
Don't you dare fight here!

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.680
If anything, he made sure you didn't miss!

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.860
Did I subconsciously back down just now?

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.530
Don't stop it, Kageyama!

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.170
I said, "gather round!"

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.080
Are you giving the shrimp the exact tosses he wants?

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.370
Have you even tried to?

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.100
What are you doing, Kageyama?

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.480
Starting tonight, I'm not practicing with you.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.430
And I won't be using the new quick with you during matches.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.450
What?!

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.870
I-Is their relationship worsening?!

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.490
You're the one that told me not to stop, aren't you?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.900
There's no point in us practicing together right now.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.460
Uh, um...

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.140
Okay!

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.030
Kenma, give me some tosses!

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.180
What?
Huh?

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.230
Kageyama started training by himself again.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.750
I can't lose!

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.640
There's only one thing I need to do right now!

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.950
That's to be able to fight the blocks in mid-air by myself!

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.820
Gymnasium #3

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.150
Oh? Tsukki, did you bring a friend today?

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.740
Pardon?

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.370
What happened to your partner?

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.700
Kageyama's practicing on his own again.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.560
I was trying to get Kenma to throw me tosses,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.170
but he ran away after the fifth one.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.960
It's amazing that you got Kenma to even give you five during practice.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.670
So...

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.760
Please let me practice with you!

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.400
Lev!

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.390
Oh, Hinata.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.720
Lev, I thought you were practicing receives with Yaku.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.350
He said I was doing well today, so he let me go.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.870
Really? Sure you didn't run away?

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.520
Hey, have you seen Lev?

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.140
Maybe he's in the bathroom.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.840
No, of course not!

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.520
He said you said it was okay and went running off.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.320
I didn't say that!

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.200
Well, whatever.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.160
Then... We have the right number of people,

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.990
so let's play some three-on-three.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.720
Eh?
Yay!

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.040
A match!

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.290
Owls            Cats

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:05.790
Um...

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.710
Isn't this just a bit unbalanced?

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.450
Whoa!

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.940
I'm playing with a setter and an ace

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.040
from one of the Tokyo powerhouse schools!

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.770
And... versus Tsukishima!

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.350
It's fine!

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.980
Let's do things we can't do during the day!

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.440
Woo-hoo!

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.160
And then I looked over

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.300
and there was a giant rhinoceros beetle, and I totally freaked out.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.600
Oh, I saw a stag beetle, too.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.620
Lev!

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.200
I told you to jump after looking at the toss!

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.080
Read blocking!

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.040
Oh, right!

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.000
Don't try jumping too far to the sides when blocking!
Wow, he got it...

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.530
When you have enough time, full stop, then jump up!

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.080
Right!

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.300
Chance ball!

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.000
Full stop,

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.030
then jump up.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.680
Damn it!

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.660
Bring it again!

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.010
Um...

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.960
If you don't wrap up soon,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.940
the cafeteria will close, and you won't get any dinner.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.570
We cannot go into battle on an empty stomach.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.970
Food!

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.290
Shrimpy.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.620
We'll continue tomorrow, all right?

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.860
Yeah!

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:44.600
Haikyu!!

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.400
It's morning!

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.000
Let me sleep a little longer...

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.700
Cafeteria Thanks for the food!

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.120
How is it that you eat that much,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.620
and none of those nutrients go toward making you taller?

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.410
Mff mmmm mrrrf.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.800
Yeah... I have no idea what you're saying.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.220
Ubugawa               Karasuno
Gora, one more! Nice serve!

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.900
It's off! Kageyama, follow through!

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:31.860
Hinata!

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.800
Tanaka, free!

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.230
All right!

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.030
Sorry! I overcompensated!

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.240
Ubugawa Karasuno Thank you very much!

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.890
Time for our penalty!

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.200
Right!

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.310
Tanaka, you get double.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.290
That's not fair!

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.050
Whoa... You know... Go!

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.030
They've changed a bit.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.790
I'm starving.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.050
Same.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.270
I'm so hungry that I'm starting to feel nauseous.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.780
Same here.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.480
But seriously...

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.240
I wonder how long they're gonna go on.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.780
Next, please!

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.250
Damn it!

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.170
Kageyama, don't think of the bottle as a target.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.700
Actually visualize it.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.390
As much as you can, visualize a spiker.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.850
Visualize the spiker...

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.620
Oh, by the way, when you're going one-on-one with a spiker,

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.390
don't try to block by centering yourself to their body.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.840
Center yourself with their dominant arm instead.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.240
Oh!

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:05.950
Um...

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.650
We are technically opponents as soon as we're in a match, right?

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.540
Why are you giving us advice?

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.790
I've always been a nice person.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.720
You don't have to look at me like that...

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.160
I want to make the Battle at the Garbage Dump a reality.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.670
All right, let's drink!

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.740
It's what our coach wants more than anything.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.260
Yes!

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.560
Hm? Where did Keishin go?
But who knows

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.120
how much longer our coach is going to continue coaching?
He's apparently helping out

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.890
with the students' practices.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.470
So because of that, What? Get him over here, Sensei.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.250
we need you guys to keep winning, too.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.820
Yes, sir.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.750
Well, it's practice for me, as well,

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.030
so don't sweat the small things.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.480
Come on. Let's get back to practice!

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.040
Owls                   Cats

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.370
Akaashi, cover!

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.920
Sorry! It's a bit short.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.170
Surround him! Spread out the block!

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.940
Damn it! You're still ridiculously huge for a first-year.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.770
He hit the block on purpose?

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.600
One more time!

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.230
You better make that toss a good one, Akaashi!

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.240
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey!

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.480
Was that... on purpose?!

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.670
When you lightly hit the block.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.160
Yup! It's a rebound!

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.660
A rebound? That's so cool!

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.080
Is it? It is, isn't it?!

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.380
You sure are good at flattering the airhead, Shrimpy.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.590
When you aren't completely ready,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.800
and you feel like your spike's going to get blocked for sure,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.910
you purposely hit the block with the ball

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:50.050
and try one more time when it bounces back.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.480
Well, of course, there are plenty of times

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.020
that fails and they just slam the ball down.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.840
That happens quite often with you, Bokuto-san.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.820
You're supposed to say, "That's not true," there, Akaashi!

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.490
Spiking doesn't just involve slamming the ball into the ground.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.440
If you're calm, you'll see how to attack.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.560
Oh, that's not true, Bokuto-san.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.080
You're late, Akaashi!

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.750
Owls Cats All right!

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.250
Akaashi, nice!

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.560
Get the last part, Shrimpy!

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.230
Right!

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.420
Ah! Hey!

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.740
You guys are playing dirty!

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.340
This isn't even a wall...

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.160
It's more like an umbrella...

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.060
There isn't anywhere to aim.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.770
If you're calm,

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.690
you'll see how to attack.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.670
He hit up?!

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.750
Ow...

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.850
Did you... actually aim for that?

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.140
That was an amazing wipe!

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.560
Oh. Well, I did aim for Lev's fingertips.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.260
What?!

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.610
It was sheer luck that it hit.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.930
I can't hit that accurately—

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.550
You were covered by three blockers, each around 190cm tall!

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.880
Not to mention that terrible toss!

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.460
Well done! I'm moved!

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.340
The valiant little warrior who fights in the face of a two-meter wall!

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.750
Talk about over-exaggerating...

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.400
Somehow 190 cm turned into two meters.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.320
I shall give you a new special attack.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.830
A special attack?!

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.100
Here's the next one!

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.500
Slot five.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:04.980
One more.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.360
I'm sure you must be pretty tired, Hitoka-chan.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.250
Are you okay?

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.570
Yes! I'm sorry!

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.430
Today's the last day, so let's do our best.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.040
Right!

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.340
Morning, Hinata!

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.480
Ah, Yachi-san. Morning!

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.680
Man, I'm starving!

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.240
Oh, yeah... You sure are full of energy this morning.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.990
You were up practicing late, too, weren't you, Hinata?

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.290
Yeah, but I just woke up.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.890
How are things shaping up?

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.230
I'm practicing something super awesome right now, so look forward to it!

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.730
"Super awesome"...

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.400
What the heck, Tsukishima?!

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.730
Nothing.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.940
Hey! Someone wake Yamaguchi up!

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.170
About the thing I was telling you earlier...

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.080
Yes, it's all been taken care of.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.000
It should arrive around noon.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.960
I see...

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:10.920
Seriously?!

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.470
Nekoma Fukurodani Hmm...

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.200
We can't seem to win against Fukurodani much.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.200
Nice serve!

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.160
Senpai! I tabulated all of the stats so they're easier to read.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.480
Got it!

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.960
Thanks!
Right!

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.480
Shibayama's pretty great.
Left!

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.570
Fukurodani: 50 Wins 14 Losses Nekoma: 42 Wins 22 Losses Ubugawa: 36 Wins 28 Losses Shinzen: 29 Wins 35 Losses Karasuno: 3 Wins 61 Losses 
As we thought, looks like Fukurodani's at the top right now.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.240
Ubugawa                    Karasuno
Looks like Ubugawa and Karasuno finished.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.510
One round of diving receives!

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.450
Right!

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.240
They have a strange dignity around them

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.780
when they take their penalties.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.890
Including the last away games,

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.580
they've done more penalties than any other team.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.780
I definitely couldn't do it.
Now, diving receives!

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.300
Whoa! Karasuno's Shrimpy's gotten really good at diving receives!

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.800
"Shrimpy"? Yaku-san, you're not much taller than Hinata.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.060
Lev, stand over there!

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.650
There was no saving him from that.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:10.940
Lev!

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.110
I told him not to mention Yaku-san's height...

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.730
That fool.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.340
Damn it. We basically kept losing all the way to the end.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.850
You guys need to keep doing your best and survive.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.120
Daichi-san?

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.040
I just happened to hear this,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.910
and I was going to keep it quiet... Wh-What is it?!

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.300
When all of these practice matches are over...

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.450
Apparently, the coaches are going to treat us to a barbecue.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.790
Bar... ...be... ...cue?!

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.310
Akaashi, who do we play next?

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.520
Karasuno.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.800
Karasuno, huh?

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.490
What?

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.430
Well, they're sort of the hardest to play against.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.930
Who knows what they're gonna do?

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.580
Well, it does look like they're getting pretty tired.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.450
Meaty meat, meat, meaty meat!

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.080
Put 'em together, you get meat and meat!

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.560
Meaty meat, meat!

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.360
Hooray for meat! Energy times a hundred!

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.800
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
What the... They're terrifying.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.450
Meat is god! Meat is god!

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.790
Sensei... Did you not tell them about the barbecue?

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.570
It just says "meal" on the schedule.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.810
Well, I guess it all worked out in the end.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.060
Hinata, do your best in the match.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.070
Thanks!

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.640
I'll be looking forward to that super awesome thing.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.110
Just watch, you jerk!

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.300
But...

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.820
I really want to see that new quick soon.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.650
Me, too.
Huh?

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.090
Kageyama!

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.210
I want to hurry up and hit that falling toss!

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.930
He just told you yesterday you guys won't be doing that quick...

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.870
Don't rush.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.150
As long as I'm missing the tosses,

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.770
it won't be any practice for you.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.230
What?!

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.990
Your will is not needed for that quick.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.860
I'll give you tosses that won't be stopped by blocks!

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.490
He was saying all of that,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.320
but Kageyama-kun was actually trying to respect Hinata..

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.910
I was thinking this yesterday, too,

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.040
but you're really creepy when you worry about others.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.920
I get it, but hurry up and give me tosses!

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.710
I want to hit them!

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.000
That's why I'm practicing so hard, you dumbass!

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:45.640
And Hinata believes that Kageyama-kun will master that toss.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.680
Ah...

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.100
So that's why he got so mad back then!

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.840
He completely believes that Kageyama-kun can do it,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.860
but Kageyama-kun doubted himself for a second.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.250
How long are you going to make me wait?

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.570
Hinata and Tsukishima-kun call Kageyama-kun the King...

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.070
But today,

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.970
it looks like the crown is on Hinata's head.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.140
I demand the ultimate toss!

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.630
Fukurodani                        Karasuno

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:23.840
Anyway, try to work the new things you've all been practicing into this match.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.720
Right!

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.080
Also, I say this every time,

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.240
but put pressure on Fukurodani's #4 when he hits.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:30.810
Right.
Yeah!

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.940
In the end, this training camp was filled with penalties,

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.640
but you guys should definitely feel different now

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.690
than you did in the first away games.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.490
Let's get an awesome win here

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.060
and go eat some delicious meat!

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.540
Yeah!

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.030
Man, meat is the best.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.610
And nothing goes better with meat than white rice.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.290
I like eating them together, too!

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.240
Throw in a salad, and it's perfect.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.080
All right! Let's win this match and eat some delicious food!

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.200
Yeah!

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.290
Next time on Haikyu!!: "Cog."

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.410
Episode 10: "Cog"
