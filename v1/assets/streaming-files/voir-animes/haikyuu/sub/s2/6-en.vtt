WEBVTT

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.430
Where are we going, Coach?

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.900
You'll know when we get there.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.330
Youth Volleyball Class Let's go home and practice!

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.580
That was so much fun!

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.790
Sorry.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.730
Hey, you made him cry.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.800
What am I even doing here?

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.820
Shh, stop that.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.760
The class is already over.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.510
Toru! Show me how to serve!

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.970
Hey! How about showing some respect first?

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.460
O-Oikawa-san!

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.900
Come on! Move those legs!

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.890
Nice receive!

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.610
One more!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.560
Whoa, I can't get that!

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.940
Are you sure you're supposed I'm tired!

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.320
to be moving around like that right after getting out of the hospital?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.810
What? If they let you out of the hospital,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.800
it means they're giving you permission to move around all you want.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.100
He's my grandpa.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.880
Huh?!

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.220
Gra...

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.950
Coach Ukai?!

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.820
Haikyu!!

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.020
Ukai So...

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.610
You couldn't figure out what to do Episode 06: "Tempo"

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.430
with this weirdo quick attack and helplessly ran away, eh, Coach?

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.600
That's your team, you weakling!

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.910
Coach?!

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.870
He's the great commander that led the nameless Karasuno to nationals.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.200
The name "Karasuno's Ukai" was super famous.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.340
They said he owned a fierce pack of crows.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.570
P-Please help me!

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.260
With what?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.510
I don't go around smacking random people.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.150
Just weaklings.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.230
You shitty old man...

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.890
I-I came here to learn to fight on my own!

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.320
You want to master mid-air battles? When you're only that tall?

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.990
It's because I'm only this tall!

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.250
I might sound like I'm saying something weird, but...

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.550
What's weird about it?

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.750
No matter what kind of genius setter you're dealing with,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.700
in what we call a quick attack,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.460
the one that's the absolute leader

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.140
is you.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.680
Stop spacing out! You're the coach, damn it!

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.630
O-Oikawa-san, what are you doing here?

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.230
I'm watching my nephew.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.090
Hey!

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.880
H-Hey... What about club?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.050
We usually have Mondays off.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.030
Y-You take a day off during the week? That's such a waste!

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.890
Resting and skipping are two different things.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.560
See ya.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.090
O-Oikawa-san, um... Nope! Stupid!

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.930
You're stupid! You stupid face!

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.460
I haven't even said anything yet!

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.560
Oikawa-san—

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.420
Nope! Can't hear you! Can't hear a thing!

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.570
Please listen to me for a second.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.050
Why should I have to listen to what my opponent has to say?

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.750
Please, Oikawa-san!

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.350
Please! Please!

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.480
Please!

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.360
Takeru.
What?

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.320
Take a picture.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.590
Hold it like this... And press this button.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.750
Don't move, Tobio.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.670
Yay! I'll call this, "Tobio is No Match For Oikawa-san!"

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.250
Toru, you're actually happy about this picture? Lame.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.090
Well, what do you want?

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.560
I'm busy, you know.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.160
You said your girlfriend dumped you, so you had free time!

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.560
Takeru! Shut up!

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.280
What? But when you came, you said you didn't know what you did wrong...

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.370
I said, "Shut up!"

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.660
So, uh, what if you were close to a tournament, and, uh...

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.690
And Iwaizumi-san said he was going to try some impossible attack...

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.800
Hey.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.490
If you want to talk to me about something,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.450
quit with the lame "what if" story and just tell me flat out.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.610
Hinata said he wants to hit our quick with his own will,

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.870
even though he had been closing his eyes this whole time.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.530
Oh, really? That'd be pretty impressive if he could do it.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.410
Why not let him?

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.790
Please don't make it sound so easy!

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.680
Hinata doesn't have any technique!

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.250
So you told him, "Just do as I say"?

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.810
You sound like a dictator.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.610
Have you put any thought into it?

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.700
Are you giving the shrimp the exact tosses he wants?

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.200
Have you even tried to?

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.780
Kageyama...

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.950
Give me a toss.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.200
If you're thinking the situation as good as it can be and you're being defensive about it,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.030
you're basically a coward.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.890
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.750
The one who has leadership in an attack isn't you...

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.710
It's the little shrimp.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.640
If you can't understand that,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.760
you're just regressing back to playing the tyrant king.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.020
Let's go, Takeru.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.890
Are you in a good mood, Toru?

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.640
I'm happy that Tobio's more run down that I thought he was.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.330
I'm totally blurry!

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.750
You'll need awareness before you improve your technique.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.170
What do you personally think about this weirdo quick of yours?

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.120
Um... I go whoosh, and then jump up as high as I can, like pop,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.670
and then the set comes toward me, like slash,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.740
and then if I wave my arm, like swoosh,

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.650
my hand happens to perfectly make contact, like whack.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.270
Er, what he's trying to say is when he jumps up with his eyes closed,

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.120
our setter, Kageyama, tosses the ball directly to him—

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.110
I get what you're trying to say.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.900
But you're wrong, Shrimpy.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.920
So long as that weirdo quick is indeed a quick attack,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.870
you still hold the initiative in this.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.380
You need to get that through your head.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.080
Don't think of your weapon as something that's unknown.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.120
Well, I guess it's faster to just show you.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.500
Shrimpy, try blocking.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.220
You're a middle blocker, aren't ya? Try stopping it.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.890
You're in junior high?

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.690
What school?

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.300
I'm in high school!

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.860
All right, here we go!

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.380
Okay!

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.490
Is this height for grade school kids?

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.230
I feel a bit taller.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.150
Third tempo.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.860
"Third tempo"?

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:37.400
That's an amazing jump!

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.050
Your face was totally above the net.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.990
Well, yeah.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.210
You've definitely got some spring in your step...

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.410
All right, next!

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.120
Second tempo.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.710
They're coming faster than before, but...

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.340
All right, next!

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.050
First tempo!

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.720
Well?

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.800
It's fast!

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.970
Can you block that?

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.280
If anything, I don't think I could do it on my own.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.910
In the three tempos you just saw,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.480
was there a big difference in how the spiker hit?

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.330
No! I don't think...

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.140
Then what was different?

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.010
The timing of their running approach?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.470
Correct! That's what the tempo is.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.280
Listen. The agility in any attack is determined by its tempo.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.570
It's not how fast or slow the toss may be,

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.060
it's the timing of the spiker's running approach.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.320
The fastest is the first tempo.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.000
It's the best way to get around the opponent's block,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.160
and is probably the attack you were doing without realizing it.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.540
But you need to actually understand it.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.750
You need to start your running approach before the setter's toss goes up...

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.200
The setter tosses to the spiker...

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.340
Which means, your weirdo quick is also an attack where the spiker leads.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.910
First... tempo...

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.310
And... I don't know what kind of attack this weirdo quick is,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.560
but this much is certain.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.530
There's no better toss than one that the spiker can easily hit.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.490
It can't be one-sided.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.180
Eh?

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.230
Hinata, practice here for a bit!

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.290
S-Sure... What a weirdo.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.460
The timing of the spiker's running approach is everything.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.960
One centimeter, one millimeter...

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.610
One second faster to the top...

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.220
But that's not enough.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.640
Up until now, I was only working to get to the top, but...

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.690
So from now on, you want to fight at the top, too.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.310
In order for that to happen,

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.110
your partner's gonna need some improvement, as well.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.620
Huh?

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.830
I'm sure Keishin will do something about that.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.540
Kageyama's an amazing guy, so I'm sure he can do it.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.340
I don't want to be left behind...

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.350
Please teach me how to fight when I'm at the top.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.470
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.460
The one who has leadership in an attack isn't you...

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.690
It's the little shrimp.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.340
If you can't understand that,

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.250
you're just regressing back to playing the tyrant king.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.400
Yes, hello—

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.500
Kageyama! Where are you right now?!

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.860
Ukai-san?

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.920
I'm heading to the school right now.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.150
What?!

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.370
I was gonna see if they were done with the inspection of the gym yet.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.710
Ah!

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.480
Kageyama!

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.340
Whoa.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.010
Stop walking! Come with me!

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.380
I'm sorry?!

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.620
A toss that stops!

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:41.030
Haikyu!!

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.740
Shrimpy,

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.520
if you're gonna fight at the top on your own,

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.450
you're gonna have to start with the fundamentals.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.110
Therefore, you're gonna be hitting one quick after another.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.420
You're going to get in all the practice that you missed before.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.330
Hello!
Heyo!

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.830
There you are.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.130
Hi!

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.840
Shrimpy, your assignment right now

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.070
is to do first tempo with anyone.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.050
Got it!

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.100
A newbie?

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.740
Your genius setter isn't here to toss to you,

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.050
He's in junior... Oh, he's in high school.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.580
so it's not gonna be easy.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.520
Ah... Right!

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.240
Also, in order to get used to the ball,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.480
you need to always be touching it.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.520
Always.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.010
Okay.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.990
It can be with your hands or feet.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.760
Volleyball is a sport where you can't hold the ball.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.660
You're only allowed to touch the ball for a few seconds...

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.990
You need to control that moment,

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.070
as though ball were a part of your body.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.610
Because your body is small,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.730
use everything else possible to make up for that.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.540
Right!

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.130
Sakanoshita Shop Tempo?

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.390
Welcome.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.740
Well, I have the basic theory of it in my head,

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.690
but I was never able to apply it.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.560
I treated your quick attack as something special when I shouldn't have,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.960
and almost forgot something very basic.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.730
I think I get the basics of tempo,

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.150
but what do you mean by a toss that stops?

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.820
Listen. First...

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.650
When you're tossing for your weirdo quick,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.950
Point of Impact

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.130
it's a toss that passes through the spiker's point of impact.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:14.580
Right...

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.460
But you're going to stop it right there,

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.750
at the point of impact.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.960
So, basically...

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.150
You're going to make the spiker's highest point of impact

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.590
the place you're going to aim for.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.000
You're not going to use so much force

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.670
that that the ball passes through the spiker's point of impact,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.280
You'll use just enough force to get to the spiker's point of impact, and then...

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.140
...kill it?

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.600
The difficulty in controlling your power and how much backspin you put on it

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.140
isn't going to be like before.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.250
Not to mention B-quick, D-quick, and slide hits...

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.450
The farther out you get, the more difficult they'll become.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.170
Can you do it?

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.260
Are you giving the shrimp the exact tosses he wants?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.920
Have you even tried to?

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.630
Don't Cause a Ruckus I'll give it a try.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.590
Tanaka-san!

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.790
Oh?

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.670
I-I'm sorry about the other day!

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.360
No problem! Kageyama just came by, too.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.810
I'm sorry for hitting you guys.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.180
Stop!

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.400
I got too worked up trying to stop you guys from fighting.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.520
Your punch really worked, Tanaka-san.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.950
But don't fight in front of girls!

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.250
Yacchan's face was as pale as a ghost.
T-T-Tanaka-shan!

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.240
They're gonna die! They're gonna die!

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.240
What is? You're scary!

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.410
Also, don't fight in front of the Vice Principal, either.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.760
Fight anywhere else.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.870
Right!

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.820
Hinata, come here a sec.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.170
All right...

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.130
When we're doing practice games, Hinata, you'll be on the B team for a while.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.680
Sugawara, I'm counting on you.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:49.840
Right!

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.240
All right, let's get this started!

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.300
Make sure you stay hydrated!

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.660
Right!

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.040
Um, Hinata...

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.310
U-Um, I was wondering if you were okay...

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.780
You and Kageyama-kun, um, uh...

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.990
I'm fine.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.620
Year 3  Class 1

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.560
Yui! Sawamura-kun's here.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.900
What?

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.590
Hey...

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.530
Once the girls finish practice,

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.900
I was wondering if we could borrow the court

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.400
until the gym closes, even just for a little bit.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.760
Oh, sure. I'll go ask.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.200
Did something happen to the second gymnasium?

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.640
No, it's just...

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.960
A lot of the guys are doing their own practices.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.810
so we don't have enough room.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.300
Damn it.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.600
Serving is the ultimate attack...

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.440
The only one at Karasuno

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.450
who can safely use a jump serve is Kageyama.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.510
I'm not good enough to be able to use it safely in matches.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.880
But then... I couldn't call it a weapon!

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.420
Asahi-san!

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.300
A Match for a Thousand

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.860
Mind if I join you?

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.960
Oh, yeah. Sure.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.510
He casually scooped it up upon entering... Damn it.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.230
Would you mind hitting some of my tosses?

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.150
Yeah, sure.

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.650
Uh, wait, what?

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.360
You're going to toss?

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.070
Could it be...

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.810
He's gonna try what Seijoh's libero was doing?

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.060
I'll help you with your serves, too, Asahi-san.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.870
I can't be left behind...

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.630
Sure. Let's do this.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.080
All right!

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.040
First Gymnasium We'll leave the rest up to you guys.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.790
Thanks!

Oh, here it is.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.420
Is this a video of Brazil's attacks?

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.470
They all started moving at once.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.410
Shinzen's attack was like this, too.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.560
Um...

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.770
A synchronized attack.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.310
Next, please.
Got it!

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.570
Good evening!

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.080
Sho-chan.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.540
There you are, Shrimpy.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.120
Um, Coach Ukai, I've been meaning to tell you...

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.430
But I'm not "Shrimpy."

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.810
It's a good enough name for a crappy player like you.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.590
Come on! Let's go, Shrimpy!

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.260
I'm ready!

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.560
You need to put all your thought into jumping with all your might.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.110
There you go.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.920
You need to be able to hit the ball at any time, at will,

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.750
regardless of who the setter is.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:59.530
Right!

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.370
Don't try to match them!

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.120
You need to jump at your own pace,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.910
not anyone else's.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.710
You need to fight with your own will!

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.590
Let's go!

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.740
Hey, Tsukki.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.670
I'm gonna head this way.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.260
I'm gonna go practice serves at Shimada-san's place.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.170
Yeah.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.060
See ya.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.450
Woof

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.670
Oh, sorry! It might be a bit short!

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.350
That's amazing, Sho-kun! Nice cover.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.110
You used to panic so quickly, even if it was just a little off.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.010
Shut up!

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.490
Up until now, I was able to hit without thinking too much

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.790
because of my amazing setter...

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.240
But now, all of your techniques and habits are different,

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.350
so I have to make it work in mid-air.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.460
It's just a little, but I can see the ball better than before.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.870
Give me a hand, Shrimpo.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.920
It went from "Shrimpy" to "Shrimpo."

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.970
He's been promoted!

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.120
Is that really a promotion?

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.840
You're going to Tokyo the day after tomorrow, aren't ya?

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.480
Nekoma's coming, too, right?

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.130
Yes.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.200
Sensei told us that Coach Nekomata's the one who invited us over.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.550
He's hard to get along with, but his volleyball sense is second to none.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:31.030
The players he's leading aren't going to be easy to handle.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.230
Let the push you to your limits.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:35.690
Right!

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.150
First Gymnasium

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.360
All right!

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.680
Next, please!

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.800
You got it!

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.250
Now, that it's summer vacation, we can practice from morning to night.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:58.000
And starting tomorrow, we'll resume the Tokyo away games.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.550
This time, we'll be there for a solid week!

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.900
This is the first and last long-term training camp

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.180
before the spring tournament prelims.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.390
Let's make the most of this opportunity,

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.750
so we have no regrets entering the spring tournament prelims.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.190
Noya-san, you started practicing tossing?

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.030
Yep! I'm gonna do a running approach to here...

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.370
Then Jumping Thunder Toss!

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.280
Uh, wait. Where'd the ball go?

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.080
How about you start by practicing normal tosses?

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:01.040
