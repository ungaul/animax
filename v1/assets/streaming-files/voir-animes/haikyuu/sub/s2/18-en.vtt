WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:09.900
Rule the Court Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Date Tech!

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.900
The Iron Wall of Date

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.700
Let's play!

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.660
Yeah.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.560
Now, now. Don't be so tense.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.620
You guys still have next year.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.120
That doesn't matter.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.080
Positions and such don't matter once you're on the court.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.100
I know, right?

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.890
Heads is Seijoh, tails is Date Tech.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.260
It doesn't matter if you're a first-year or a third-year.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.180
The strong are the strong,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.470
and the one who drops the ball loses.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.800
All right!

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.540
It's pretty simple, actually.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.420
Haikyu!!

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.990
Episode 18: "The Losers"

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.370
It's out!

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.160
Don't mind! Next, next!

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.330
I'm sorry.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.200
I haven't even hit that many,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.800
but I've managed to miss three spikes this set.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.510
Wakunan                            Karasuno

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.510
Oh, man. What's up with him?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.470
I think it's because he's on the right, and he's not used to that.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.930
But I think the biggest factor could be pressure.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.780
One more!

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.990
Got it.
All right, one touch!

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.200
Damn it... They're pretty good, after all.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.160
Wakunan                               Karasuno

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.070
All right!

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.120
Wakunan's Nakashima's really stepping up his game.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.280
On the other hand, seems like Karasuno can't get it back.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.010
Hey!

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.590
You got a look on your face like the world's going to end!

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.230
It's too early for the world to end.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.750
I'm the Earth Defense Force!

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.550
I do not look like that!

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.810
All right! Chikara's back!

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.500
If the ball gets blown away, there's not much you can do,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.390
Calm down. I can't keep dwelling on it.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.230
but there are still some that you can pick up.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.960
I've got to do this! Like Daichi-san!
Your attacks are getting in there. Keep it up!

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.940
Right!

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.790
Coach!

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.400
Huh?

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.620
So the Little Giant was like Wakunan's #1?

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.410
Well... His play style is probably

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.510
the most similar in the prefecture right now.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.960
Hey, don't try to duel with him.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.120
He's better in mid-air battles than you are.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.300
Just play like you usually do!

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.280
Why do you have to break my heart like that?!

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.270
That was just some kind advice!

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.520
Kind?!

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.160
I know that they're good!
H-Hinata, calm down...

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.480
That's why I'm trying to figure out what to do!

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.700
Don't try to use the brain you don't have!

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.440
What did you say?!

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.400
Wakunan                            Karasuno

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.610
Takeru!

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.230
What a narrow straight!

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.280
He's so good!

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.990
Takeru Nice kill!
Nice kill!

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.950
Your height doesn't even reach 170cm...

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.780
You're definitely strong, Tabi, one more nice serve!

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.670
but I'm not going to lose, either.
Yeah, leave it to me!

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.880
I'm the one who's going to surpass the Little Giant.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.830
Wakunan Nice serve!

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.680
Look out!

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.920
Hinata, get the last!

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.760
Yeah!

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.180
I'm going to go for a wipe.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.020
That's a king-sized homerun!

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.360
I'm sorry!

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.560
As Kageyama said, Don't mind, don't mind!

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.660
I told you not to try to match him, you dumbass!

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.490
right now, we're definitely no match for Nakashima's personal skills.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.950
Tabi! One more, nice serve!

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.690
All right!

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.170
It's up front!

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.630
All right, we picked it up!

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.170
Two blockers!

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.760
Ah, again!

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.100
So fast!

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.390
Look out!

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.530
It's a counter!

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.610
Your skills are no match for Nakashima or the Little Giant's right now...

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.830
But...

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.080
You can fight with everything you've learned!

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.220
Yeah!

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.960
Are you all right?

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.130
I got too enthusiastic.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.710
Be careful! Seriously, be careful!

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.920
Bumping into a guy this light is nothing.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.640
That was awesome! Nice kill!

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.740
Even if we're backed into a corner,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.740
we still have the firepower to break through.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.600
That's our weapon.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.160
Kageyama's saying something decent?!

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.900
I think you said something like that before, Ennoshita-san.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.530
Oh, yeah...

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.050
Yeah.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.440
S-Sorry. Are you all right, Sensei?

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.450
I totally flipped backwards.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.520
You wouldn't believe he'd been having trouble

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.830
with diving receives with that one.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.210
Yeah.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.810
Go! Killer serve!

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.420
Karasuno's #10... What reflexes and maneuverability.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.380
Wakunan Shiro!

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.510
A feint!

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.990
Nice receive!

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.690
Out, it's out!

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.360
The toss was low! Sorry!

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.970
I could see the feint, but I couldn't move fast enough.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.150
If it were Daichi-san,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.570
he would have been able to get it to the setter properly.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.780
I'm sorry.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.420
What's that supposed to mean?

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.700
Trying to do the same moves that Daichi-san would do...

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.420
You're ten years... Well, that's a bit too long...

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.220
You're about a year away from that.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.020
No matter how you look at it, that was a nice receive.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.510
Let's not mention any realistic numbers like "one year"...

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.860
Karasuno

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.990
Cover! Cover!

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.280
Takeru!

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.580
All right!
Damn it!

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.620
We've got to do something about that wipe,
That was close! Don't mind!

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.040
or it's going to be rough.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.450
I don't have time to wallow in my failure now.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.150
Playing on par with Daichi-san

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.010
won't be possible right away.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.090
I know that they're good!

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.270
That's why I'm trying to figure out what to do!

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.100
Hey, may I have a moment?

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.900
When their #1 goes for a wipe, I'll pick up the ball.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.200
Tanaka and Asahi-san are way better at receiving powerful hits than I am.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.080
If you two defend the straight sides,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.560
I'll go deep in the middle and pick up any balls that go over there.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.790
I can't guarantee that it'll work, but...

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.690
Yeah, let's give it a shot.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.120
Th-Thank you very much.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.300
Like I'm any better at getting powerful hits than Ennoshita...

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.140
Got it!

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.310
All right!

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.230
Takeru-san!
Mine!

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.940
Two blockers!

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.410
I can't guarantee that it'll work, but...

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.530
Yeah, let's give it a shot.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.770
If I can't pick this up...

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.550
I don't have the right to be on this court!

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.630
Ennoshita!

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.590
Damn...

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.890
Connect!

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:50.060
Haikyu!!

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.200
Ennoshita!

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.160
Damn...

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.330
Hinata, get the last!

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.820
Three blockers!

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.580
If I hit, they'll get it.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.540
I'm going to regroup.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.710
He... All right! Got it!

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.630
What?! He hit the block on purpose?!

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.860
A rebound.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.560
Huh? When did he learn that?!

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.980
During the summer training camp.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.980
But he just got lucky.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.390
One more!

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.660
With Daichi absent, our defense is weaker than usual.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.580
Whether intentionally or subconsciously, Bring it!

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.870
Hinata's trying to deal with this situation.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.660
That was awesome, Hinata!

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.800
I feel like someone's complimenting me!

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.180
You're imagining it.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.650
Where did you learn that?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.170
Actually, Bokuto-san taught me during the training camp...

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.910
I knew that Karasuno had an amazing shrimp,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.160
What? No fair!

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.660
You lucky bastard!

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.160
but I thought that was only because of the setter.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.110
You should have told me earlier!

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.070
And yet...

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.680
All right, Hinata, Tanaka, nice kill!

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.620
Chikara!

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.800
Nice receive.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.200
No fair... Getting one from Noya-san is no fair.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.440
Getting a compliment from Nishinoya about a receive

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.130
would cheer anyone up.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.880
He's in.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.340
Pardon?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.200
He's just a substitute,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.400
and he can't completely blend in with the vibe on the court

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.860
since he doesn't belong.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.930
I think that's how Ennoshita felt.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:56.000
But I think that play just now banished that feeling.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.520
That play just now?

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.900
He thought of it on his own, told the team,

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.700
and carried it out.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.680
Plays like that give you confidence.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.100
I see.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.060
It's difficult.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.510
All right!

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.760
Karasuno... Up until recently,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.390
they were an average team that didn't stand out.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.400
Truly, the Little Giant!

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.810
That match showed me that there was a path like this when

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.560
This is a good course!

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.820
He can see so well!

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.860
I was starting to worry about my height.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.120
Karasuno's #10...

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.820
The guy who wears the same number as the Little Giant did back then.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.360
One more!

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:48.780
Takeru!

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.290
First, I'm going to defeat you.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.990
#1's doing a back attack!

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.540
Karasuno                                        Wakunan
All right!
We caught up!

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.510
Sorry, the toss was low.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.460
Ennoshita, nice serve!

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.050
Got it!

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.080
Nice!

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.620
All right! Thank goodness.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.410
Isamu-nii and Takeru-nii,

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.940
the oldest and second oldest brothers... Are you sure you're not backwards?

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.350
You're gonna make your brother cry.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.810
Karasuno                                                      Wakunan
Asahi-san, nice serve!

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.950
Sorry! That was long!

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.410
It's going over the net!

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.170
Takeru-san!

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.370
Kageyama, push through!

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.640
It's at times like this that I'm reminded

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.040
how high that wall is.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.960
Nice cover, Tabi!

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.080
Connect!

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.920
Karasuno's #10... I'm not going to lose to you!

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.880
Takeru!

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.570
Not me, or my team's bravery!

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.770
All right!

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.980
Karasuno                     Wakunan

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.570
Hang in there.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.340
If you keep it up, they're start making mistakes.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.320
Not to mention their captain's absent.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.570
Hang in there until they break.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:09.360
Right!
And...

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:15.620
Go show them who's really the Little Giant in this match.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.640
Right!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.300
Hinata, serve!

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.230
Right!

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.760
Ukai-san... Huh?

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.210
He was saying that it might be okay to start giving tosses to Azumane-san

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.240
since the match is almost over.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.080
Right.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.640
The quick's coming!

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.060
Nice receive!

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.510
Now that Hinata's in the back,

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.300
they're definitely all going to start being cautious of Azumane-san.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.700
When it's best to set the ball to Azumane-san...

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.370
Right now...

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.870
It should be this.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.570
All right!

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.910
It's in! Thank goodness.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.560
Chikara!
He set to their #6, who's only gotten

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.220
Ennoshita, nice kill!

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.270
a few hits in, despite this chance coming in the last part of the game.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.300
That first-year setter's definitely gutsy.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.260
Damn it! Not sure if I should be happy or sad...

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.430
Karasuno Asahi-san, nice serve!

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.360
Give 'em a fierce one!

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.350
Now's the time to get the lead!

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.640
It's out!

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.160
All right!

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.230
Nice call!

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.020
I'm sorry...

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.190
Next! One more!

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:30.900
Karasuno                     Wakunan

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.010
Don't look at the score... Matsushima, nice serve!

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.120
Calm down. Stay calm.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.040
Crap!

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.260
It's out!

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:40.750
Nice call!

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.210
I-I'm sorry... Right, let's change it up!

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.710
There's no problem if we get the next one!

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.170
Hey, Matsushima!

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.480
The next time you're up front,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.780
if you get depressed again, I'm going to make you buy me a popsicle.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.720
Right.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.680
Karasuno                Wakunan
Karasuno's at match point.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.910
And here comes Karasuno's #10.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.390
Wakunan's in trouble.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.070
Got it!

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.160
All right!
They targeted the spot Yu didn't cover?

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.200
They're calm.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.880
Kawatabi-san, nice serve!

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.360
Tabi, get this one!

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.160
So if we miss this, it's all over.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.210
You'd look really cool if you hit this one with everything you've got.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.470
It's up! Nishinoya, nice!

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.310
It's off! But a quick isn't impossible.
Kageyama!

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.100
Got it!

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.390
Or should I let Tanaka-san have it?

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.280
But we can go with a quick.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.230
It's a bit high?

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.530
He panicked.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.070
Hang in there... Until the opponent breaks.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:55.690
Chance ball!

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.910
Hinata!

00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:59.870
Don't flail!

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.660
A good jump...

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.040
...starts from good footing!

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.930
I guess we really don't have an advantage with

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.460
Karasuno's captain missing.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.230
Watch the ball!

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.920
Yeah.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.600
It's too late!

00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.100
All... ...right!

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.580
All right!

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.870
Show Your Tenacity

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.060
Karasuno                       Wakunan
Thank you very much!

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.700
What?

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.740
One-on-one, I couldn't beat their #1.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.750
He was more of a Little Giant than me.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.910
Of course. You've still got at least 100 years to go, you dumbass.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.870
Hey! What are you guys doing?

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.840
Come on, line up!

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.800
Show Your Tenacity Bow.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.260
Thank you very much.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.360
Today was just our second match.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.940
Our next opponent will be even stronger.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.900
Daichi-san!

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.630
Uh, um...

00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.940
I'm sorry.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.790
D-D-D... Daichi!

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.790
Daichi-san!

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.980
D-Daichi-san! A-Are... I'm fine.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.220
No, seriously. I got some rest, and honestly,

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.750
I'm better than before the match.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.210
I'll work twice as hard in the next match.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.780
You guys must be exhausted from playing a full set.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.640
Come on, rest.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.100
Oh, our next opponent's playing right now.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.850
I was watching from around the time the score was 20.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.230
At first, I wanted to get back at soon as possible, but...

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.910
I saw you guys and thought you'd be okay.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.620
I thought I'd actually destroy your rhythm if I showed up.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.250
That last one... Nice receive, Ennoshita.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.340
Right.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.260
Sorry, could you go on ahead?

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.620
Doesn't Ennoshita seem a bit down? We won.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.220
Yeah.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.720
Half of the spikes I hit were misses,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.570
and I only got real receives in the last half.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.320
I somehow feel this was the first time I got to fight properly to the end.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.360
And yet...

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.830
Don't you dare relax now!

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.320
You need to think that you're gonna defeat

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.300
the next opponent that comes around, you idiot!

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.290
You idiot, idiot, idiot!

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.610
That was amazing!

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.470
I was watching the last bit with Sawamura-san.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.780
We're gonna win the next one, too!

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.020
Doesn't Yamaguchi-kun seem down?

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.350
Sorry... I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.540
so go on ahead.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.960
He's really pumped about going to the bathroom.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.080
He must need to take a shit.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.840
Say "poop!" You're so vulgar, Kageyama-kun!

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.340
I don't think he actually went to the bathroom.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.060
Hey, Takeru. It's meeting time.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.660
You know... Huh?

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.550
That last bit was in slow motion.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.430
I met eyes with their #10 at that moment,

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.890
and I could tell that he figured out

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.100
where I was aiming for the wipe.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.480
That was the first time I was able to see that much.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.940
It gave me chills.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:41.900
Once more...

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.980
Let me do it once more.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.660
Aoba Johsai

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:59.120
Push it, push it, push it, push it! Push it, push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:05.530
Rule the Court Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Date Tech!

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.590
The Iron Wall of Date

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.300
Hey, don't eat too much.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.390
Now...

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.140
I wonder who our next opponent is.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.070
Lately, I've been conflicted as coach because everyone's doing so well.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.490
And Nishinoya keeps scolding me, too.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.880
Want to join me?

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.870
Uh, I'm a minor!

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.950
