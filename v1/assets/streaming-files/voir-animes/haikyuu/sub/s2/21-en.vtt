WEBVTT

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.620
Out!

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.960
Lucky!

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.420
Karasuno                            Aoba Johsai
We won the first set against Seijoh!

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.360
We won the first set!

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.820
All right!

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.880
Take the second set, too!

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.790
Sorry.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.550
That idiot! Not only was that obviously Kindaichi's ball,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.350
but then he steals it only to hit it out?!

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.700
And they were at set point!

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.350
How can I even start to explain?!

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.320
That's dangerous!

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.450
Iwaizumi!

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.050
Yeah, that's it! That's how to start!

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.570
Oh, I'm fine...

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.920
I was feeling stressed because I hadn't been put in the match.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.040
That's not a valid reason!

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.670
Who the hell is that?

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.000
Why would Seijoh swap in a guy like that?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.800
Aoba Johsai                                Karasuno

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.610
Ah, that guy from earlier is there.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.420
He's starting this set.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.090
Since he's replacing Kunimi, he might be pretty smart.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.140
Be careful.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.840
You're more or less free to play how you want,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.230
but if you interfere with us, you'll be back on the bench.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.540
Just don't do any unnecessarily dangerous plays.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.210
Right.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.610
Why did you only reply to Iwa-chan?!

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.720
He challenged Iwaizumi-san a whole bunch of times,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.410
and lost every single time, so he at least listens to Iwaizumi-san.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.820
Not happening!
What are we, a wolf pack?

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.710
Well, the one who'll be using him is Oikawa-san.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.040
Right.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.840
We're gonna take this momentum and run with it!

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.730
We're gonna win the second set, too!

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.090
Yeah!

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.410
Haikyu!!

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.440
Episode 21: "The Destroyer"

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.900
Asahi-san, get one! Nice serve!

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.020
Out!

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.290
Damn it! Sorry!

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.810
So close! You'll get the next one!

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.610
Don't mind!
Your face is scary!

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.620
What'd you say?!

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.240
Oikawa, nice serve!

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.330
Aoba Johsai                                Karasuno

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.950
Out, out!

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.190
Sorry!

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.960
Don't mind. We'll get the next one.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.120
I wonder what's wrong with Oikawa-kun.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.680
He messed up another serve.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.680
But that speed is incredible.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.930
Touching that would break off your arms.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.990
I feel like we're getting more in sync.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.490
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.400
Damn you!

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.040
Nice cover, Iwa-chan!

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.820
There are three attackers on the front line... Who's it going to be?

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.110
Mad Dog-chan.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.030
Open from the right?!

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.970
What the heck is "Mad Dog"?!

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.200
Is it an alias? That's awesome!

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.960
One blocker!
What?

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.510
He's sprinting basically parallel to the net?

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.540
Three blockers!

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.220
That cut shot was insane!

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.860
So that's why he was running like that.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.850
Hm?

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.570
When you're facing the block,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.460
there are choices you can make,

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.980
but chances are you'll get blocked.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.230
Instead, he hit it to cut across the blockers.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.550
He comes in from the right and hits with his right hand,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.610
pulling off that incredible cut shot.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.980
Mad Dog is amazing!

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.790
Aoba Johsai                                Karasuno

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.380
Iwaizumi, nice serve!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.960
It's coming back! Chance ball!

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.010
Damn it! Sorry!

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.130
Oikawa and Iwaizumi can really pressure us if they make a lot of serves.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:26.820
Got it!

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.470
And now, there's also the Mad Dog...

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.890
A double quick?!

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.730
All right!

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.310
Great, great, Kentaro! Push it, push it, Kentaro! One more time!

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.160
I know he's a mad dog, but he's not going to keep biting,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.120
so you can come in.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.010
The Shrimp knew you weren't going to hit it, Kindaichi.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.730
Sorry, I was a bit scared.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.160
Iwa-chan, one more! Nice serve!

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.130
Yeah!

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.800
Nice receive!

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.260
C quick!

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.400
Y-You okay?!

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.390
Y-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.020
It's that #16 again! Three points in a row!

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.480
Even though they're getting in, those attacks seem pretty violent.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.280
Ever since that #16 came in, their attack rhythm has changed.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.360
Kyotani, nice kill!

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.030
Iwaizumi, one more! Nice serve!
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.920
Sorry!

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.700
All right!
We finally get a point back.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.130
Nice, Makki!

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.340
Here it comes!

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.780
Let's battle, Mad Dog!

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.180
After letting #16 go all out on his attacks,

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.760
now it's a slide hit from Kindaichi!

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.360
All right!

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.890
He's angry that he was used as a decoy.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.780
Though that itself makes him an even better decoy.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.350
I'll make your fangs even sharper.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.210
Let's play carefully! That's a Seijoh we're not familiar with.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.670
Aoba Johsai                                               Karasuno
Kindaichi, nice serve!

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.350
Got it!

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.510
Left!
Center!

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.780
Is this a strategy where one middle blocker is always on Hinata?

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.890
It's up! Cover!

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.480
Got it! Kyotani, get the last!

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.190
Sorry! It's close to the net!

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.900
Three blockers!

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.180
If he hits it, it'll get caught.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.570
Bring it back once!

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.280
Nice block!
All right!

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.030
That was an intense full swing.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.150
That idiot...

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.750
You idiot! There are other ways to hit or even feint!

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.710
If I don't attack in with all I've got, it doesn't feel good!

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.900
Why you... Now, now, Mizoguchi-kun...

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.420
He'll eventually correct what he has to correct.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.850
Right...

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.810
So about him being pretty smart...

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.920
I just thought that he might be!

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.560
He doesn't know the bliss of a feint... What a waste.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.020
Aoba Johsai                                  Karasuno

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.020
Makki!

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.200
Nice, Nishinoya!

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.200
Nice, Makki! Mad Dog-chan!

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.500
It's the guy who hits from the side again.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.130
I'm going to stop him this time!

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.750
All right!

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.330
We're saved.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.860
Having three blockers on you and then trying to hit

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.470
as hard as you can on a narrow course is pretty risky.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.480
That attack that seems to be powerful, but unreliable...

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.560
Since he didn't start in this match,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.180
that #16 just might be a double-edged sword.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.820
That #16's spike...

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.900
It's all shwing! Whoosh!

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.860
It's so cool!

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.410
Right? Right?

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.010
Of course, Mad Dog-chan is a strong jumper,

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.120
as well as unbelievable dorsal and abdominal muscles...

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.930
He goes in tight and lets loose!

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.720
It's intense, right?

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.470
If he gets through a block, the ball won't be easy to pick up.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.200
He finally got one in.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.380
Oikawa used him well.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.420
If it were me, I would have passed to someone else.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.850
All right!
Tenacity and boldness.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.320
You can't use the mad dog if you're scared.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.820
Kyotani, nice serve!

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.210
Out!

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.600
All right!

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.160
His serve is quite dynamic, too.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.820
Nice call!

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.870
Aoba Johsai                                Karasuno
One step forward, one step back.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.620
It's basically a stalemate.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.330
Yeah. That #16 can score a lot, but makes just as many mistakes.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.330
All right!

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.660
Iwaizumi-san, nice serve!

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.770
Cover! Cover!
Makki, get the last!

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.330
Got it!

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.350
One more! One more!

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.770
The receive is off!

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.480
It's coming to the left!

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.320
It's on purpose.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.660
Mad Dog! His timing's even faster now.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.370
Second tempo!

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.900
We're well aware that he's a double-edged sword.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.830
That's why we put him in!

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.710
All right!

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.720
Great, great, Kentaro! Push it, push it, Kentaro! One more time!

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.140
That's a crazy angle.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.590
Tearing off a block with your own hands

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.930
is definitely bliss only a setter knows.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.630
Get on it!

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.600
Nice receive!

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.310
Center!

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.900
Aoba Johsai Karasuno All right!

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.980
Shoyo, nice serve!

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.000
Hinata, give it all you've got!

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.460
Again, I'm rotated to the back without getting a single spike in...

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.900
Got it!

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.460
Nice receive!

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.260
All right! Here we go!

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.680
Hinata's back attack!

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.890
My first back attack!

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.560
All right!

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.020
Did you think now was your opportunity to use that?

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.730
I did, too.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.580
Keep calm, keep calm, keep calm...

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.700
My back attack debut...

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.480
I thought they could break it, too.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.120
If they don't start catching up, this'll get ugly.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.130
Ah!

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.580
Ah?!

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.870
Sugawara got called to the bench?

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.000
They're changing setters again?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.770
Kageyama doesn't seem to be doing bad.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.030
What happened now was just due to Oikawa being intense...

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.050
Actually, I don't think they're switching out Kageyama.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.510
We're not going to let you just take it.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.760
We're going to do everything we can.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:46.990
Haikyu!!

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.450
Is Sugawara-san switching with someone?

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.060
It's a strategic player trade.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.160
Don't make it sound so complicated.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.830
Come on, college student.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.770
When someone's not doing well or someone gets hurt,

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.430
there are times where a pinch server or a one-point blocker goes in, right?

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.890
The latter is a strategic player trade.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.150
All right!

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.270
Aoba Johsai                                Karasuno

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.270
Iwaizumi, nice kill!

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.970
In the last Seijoh match,

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.880
they were cornered and ended up being forced to switch, but...

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.510
This time, it's most likely for them to get the win.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.970
#16 is an unknown element, and dealing with Seijoh has gotten even more difficult.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.480
But we're not going to just let them take the game.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.920
Yes, but before that...

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.920
Oikawa-san, nice serve!

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.680
Oh, here it comes.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.250
That's a nice serve toss.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.110
All right!

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.320
It's like getting slapped in the face really hard

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.390
and coming back to reality.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:17.750
Neither of us can let the other win, and we've both trained to win.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.040
It all makes sense.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.780
It's to be expected, but the reality is still so terrifying.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.470
Aoba Johsai                                Karasuno

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.340
One more, nice serve!

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.520
Front!

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.900
Damn it! I held back too much!
Nice receive, Nishinoya!

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.830
Left!
Tanaka-san!

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:44.820
Three blockers!

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.660
All right!

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.770
Ryu! Well done!

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.120
Ah, here it comes.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.430
The switch.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.320
All right! We're gonna catch up.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.540
Yeah!

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.000
Suga, we need that nice serve!

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.800
Yup.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.760
Bring it!

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.970
Suga-san, nice serve!

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.920
Serving right after switching in sure is nerve wracking.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.890
But there's only one place to aim for.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:21.850
Kyotani!

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.940
That was good!

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.980
Now their #16 was late in attacking.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.950
All right!

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.110
A break!
Aoba Johsai                               Karasuno

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.940
Suga-san! One more, nice serve!

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:48.250
Again...

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.200
Kyotani is a wing spiker,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.860
but he's the type who goes after quicks one after another.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.140
They're getting Kyotani to move on the serves so he can't go after the spikes.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.530
Karasuno's #2 has hit on an annoying tactic.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.900
Daichi-san, nice receive!

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.110
All right!

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.120
Yes!

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.900
Kageyama pulled back from an attack?

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.370
Five Karasuno spikers?!

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.120
All right!

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.340
N-Nice kill... Damn it. Kageyama's straight is awesome!

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.990
Is this what you call two setters?

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.180
Even more jargon... Then...

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.140
Strategic one point two setters!

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.360
Right?

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.350
That's too long.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.860
All right! One more point!
Aoba Johsai            Karasuno

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.080
All right!

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.190
Switching players now?

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.980
They're in a good spot.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.400
All of the third-years are good at receiving.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.530
I see...

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:10.340
Net Server

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:02.730
Volleyball has a rotation system, and the players' positions are always changing.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.790
The front line and backline have different jobs, so each rotation has a specialty.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:22.560
And apparently... Net Server

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.000
The rotation when Tsukishima is serving,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.570
is weak for both defense and offense.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.140
There are only two spikers in front,

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.580
and Tsukishima can't block from the back.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.410
Considering their rotation,

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.630
it's quite a feat that they were able to keep getting points.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.940
Aoba Johsai Well, what's it going to be?

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.300
How about we make them miss?

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.160
Yeah.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.580
Suga-san! One more! Nice serve!

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.080
They're going after Kyotani again!

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.060
Got it!

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.160
Nice, Makki!

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.460
As usual, they figure things out quickly.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.090
All right!

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.760
Suga-san, nice!

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.590
Thanks.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.400
Damn it. I wanted to take it to a tie.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.980
Aoba Johsai                     Karasuno

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.690
Tanaka-san!

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.650
Yeah!

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.990
Kageyama, nice serve!

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:23.160
Iwa-chan!

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.460
He picked it up!

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.670
Watacchi!

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.840
Right!

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.130
All right!

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.330
How do I put this?

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.980
They're forcing #16 to do all their attacks.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.480
Yeah.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.560
Maybe they're trying to get all the attention on #16

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.940
and then hand it off to someone else.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.930
No matter how many balls go to the Mad Dog,

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.900
I'm not gonna be tricked anymore!

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:01.950
Tanaka-san!

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.030
Got it!

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.740
Nice, Makki!

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.620
I know why we put Kyotani in...

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.280
It's for a little extra punch power.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.880
For a bit more offense.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.010
Mad Dog-chan!

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.820
If we don't use him to his fullest, we're in trouble!

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.520
All right!

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.680
Damn it...

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.170
Here they come, here they come!

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.320
Hey, we're in a good spot.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.660
They managed to get into the 20's.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.750
Even if they lose this set, Karasuno won the first set.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.280
As long as they get the next one, they'll be fine.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.010
No...

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.910
They need to do whatever they can to win this set.
We're gonna finish this!

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.630
If they don't, I have a bad feeling about the outcome.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.240
Kidaichi! One more! Nice serve!

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.780
Front!

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.960
S-Sorry!

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.340
You're thinking about your aim too much.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:05.870
Here we go!

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.150
Tanaka, nice serve!

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.430
Nice receive!

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.240
All right!

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:28.200
Trying not to think about something is the same as thinking about it.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.410
Aoba Johsai                                            Karasuno
Kyotani, nice serve!

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.670
Bring it!

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.480
All right!

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.960
The double-edged sword...

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:58.120
Putting in #16 was sink-or-swim bet for Seijoh,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.420
but I thought they had already used him successfully.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.030
Sensei!
Yes!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.640
All right!

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.220
Again? So quick!

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.580
Now Karasuno's used up all of their time outs.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.260
With #16 as their new weapon,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.040
they were able to score point after point in the chaos,

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:22.710
and use #16's abilities to the fullest during most of this set.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.970
Kyotani is a slow-starter who requires a lot of support.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.010
But, once he gets started, he's strong.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.520
This isn't good.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.220
When a new set starts, it tends to mimic

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.190
the end of the previous set, and the match as a whole.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.150
At this rate, Seijoh definitely has the upper hand.
Let's bring it in! Karasuno, fight!

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.840
Do whatever you can to just take this set and win it!
Yeah!

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.080
Kyotani, one more! Nice serve!

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.730
Let's get this one!

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.150
Yeah!

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.250
Oh, shut up already. I know.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.790
Please let me go in.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.990
Your engine's starting to get warmed up, Mad Dog-chan.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.320
Let's finish this!

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.700
Kyotani, we're gonna take this set.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.310
Right.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.200
Why do you only answer Iwa-chan?!

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.080
I'm not gonna give you any more tosses!

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.300
