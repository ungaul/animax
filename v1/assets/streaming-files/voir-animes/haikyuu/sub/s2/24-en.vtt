WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.620
Karasuno Aoba Johsai Up front!

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.060
Slam it down!

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.400
All right!

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.730
Yes! A break!

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.120
Yes, yes, yes! They reversed it!

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.830
That's amazing... He hit that before the attack line?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.920
Because he hit it by snapping his wrist, the spike wasn't as powerful.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.790
But as long as it gets past the block, they can't pick the ball up from that angle.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.060
Did Kageyama mean to give that to Hinata?

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.860
Push through!

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.060
Hinata, nice kill!

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.200
Or did he make a mistake?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.010
Shut up.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.010
Hey, that was awesome!

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.970
That was right below!

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.700
Did you aim for that?!

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.130
Hinata was close to the net, so I made the set close, too.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.690
I'm glad it worked out.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.400
Tobio's genius-like qualities

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.110
don't lie in his techniques, but rather how stupid he is.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.210
Where others would probably hold back, he goes straight for it.
All right! Let's get one more!

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.780
Right!

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.420
In both a good and bad way.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.420
When he's concentrating, he can't see around himself

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.690
and doesn't even realize that no one's keeping up with him.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.260
But...

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.080
Tsukishima, one more! Nice serve!

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.790
Now an idiot that'll walk in front of Tobio has appeared.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.790
You put a lot of strength into that!

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.720
I just went somewhere there wasn't a blocker.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.420
Their #10 finally made a move.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.440
Yeah... Those two never cease to surprise me.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.740
But...

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.700
A volleyball team with six strong players is stronger.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.740
Come on, bring it!

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.020
Let's get this one!

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.660
Yeah!

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.410
If you understand that, then good.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.660
Fly Rule the Court

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.850
We're going to win!

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.400
Haikyu!!

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.890
Episode 24: "The Absolute Limit Switch"

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.490
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.540
Got it!

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.460
Nice receive!
That attack... Left!

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.540
It was just luck.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.040
I'm going to crush it before...

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.780
...it matures!

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.490
All right!

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.160
All right! We're tied!

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.450
Go for it!

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.010
All right!

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.870
Tanaka-san, nice kill!
Ryu!

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.620
Yeah!
All right!

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.340
Matsukawa-senpai, fight!

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.840
We're counting on you!

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.510
Yeah!

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.600
A pinch server, huh?
Yahaba, get one for us.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.720
They're probably strengthening their defense, too.
Right!

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.200
Yahaba, nice serve!

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.470
With everything I have...

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.030
Asahi!

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.450
Sorry!
Cover! Cover!

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.110
Tanaka-san!

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.440
Two blockers!

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.680
Yahaba!
Right!

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.240
Kyotani!
Crap! It's short!

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.910
All right!

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.980
Did he just hit with his left hand?!

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.010
He's right-handed, right?

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.620
Did he just manage to do that on the spot?

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.660
The ability to fully control his body, huh...

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.070
Karasuno Aoba Johsai A break...

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.410
If they get into the 20s first, it's going to be rough.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.560
Don't let them get a bigger lead!

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.930
Yeah!

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.810
Nice receive!

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.160
All right!

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.030
You little brat...

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.740
Kyotani...

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.900
We're counting on you!

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.040
Yeah!

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.400
Good, good. We've caught up.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.680
Yeah, that's some concentration...

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.780
Tanaka, nice serve!

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.100
These guys never cease to surprise me.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.370
Got it!

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.740
They're coming on the right! Right!
#16! #16!

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.560
Stop them!

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.000
All right!
Nice one-touch!
Yes!

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.530
Connect! Connect!

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.400
It's off! Look out on the left!

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.240
Get back!

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.280
Nice receive!

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.160
Wow... One more! One more!

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.880
Cover!

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.620
Left!

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800
Damn it!

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.820
All right!

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.070
Now we're in the 20s!

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.370
Karasuno Aoba Johsai They got there first.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.770
We don't have to panic.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.360
It's still just one point.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.520
All right!

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.890
We're counting on you!

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.400
There he is!

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.760
The pinch server who got five points in a row in the second set.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.660
We're counting on you, Yamaguchi!

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.940
Stay calm!

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.640
Give it your all!

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.400
Right!

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.800
Go!
Tadashi!

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.110
Nice serve!

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.230
Yamaguchi-kun! Do that thing again!

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.950
Yamaguchi.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.280
Get a nice serve in.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.750
Yeah.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.710
Karasuno       Aoba Johsai

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.990
Nice serve!

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.010
Out.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.350
No...

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.730
This time it went long?!

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.190
Yay!
Yeah!

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.100
What?!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.820
He actually connected with it!

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.480
Watari, get the last!

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.240
Right.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.240
Chance ball!

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.180
A synchronized attack!

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.790
Yeah!

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.830
Damn, his switch is totally turned on.
Nice receive, Iwa-chan.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.250
Iwaizumi-san, nice!

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.900
Wow...

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.420
Makki!

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.220
A feint!

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.510
Damn it all!

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.970
Yes! We managed to limit #12 to one serve.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.940
All right!

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.220
Nice kill!

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:22.940
Yeah!

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.750
When I was a kid, I only did spikes because they were fun,

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.690
but now I can truly say...

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.010
I'm glad I learned the bliss of receiving an opponent's perfect hit.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.870
Yamaguchi, don't mind!

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:49.090
But seriously, is that the same guy from the Inter-High prelims?

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.580
Hanamaki, nice serve!

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.780
That one couldn't be helped.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.290
The opponent was too good.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.620
Don't mind.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.290
Nice receive, Tanaka-san!
Right.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.180
Yamaguchi!

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.010
That was a great serve.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.170
Every hit is really heavy.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.070
Yeah...

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.000
They're just gonna have to stay on the ball

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.200
and keep stacking up one point at a time...

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.200
That's the only path they have.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.040
Karasuno Aoba Johsai All right!

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.920
Neither side is backing down.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.780
If they get another deuce, do they have to keep playing until they get two points ahead?

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.750
No...

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.880
They're not gonna have time to think about that.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.850
Bring it!

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.360
Seriously?

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.660
All right!

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.090
Great, great, Toru! Push it, push it, Toru! One more time!

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.790
Nice serve!
What is this?

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.500
An amazing serve like that right now?

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.830
Is he some kind of monster?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.080
One more!

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.970
Karasuno Aoba Johsai All right!

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.260
Seijoh's at match point.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.970
It's that again...

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.040
We're just gonna have to pick it up.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.930
Yeah.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.630
Switch it up! Switch it up!

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.140
Their mental strength is amazing.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.700
They should be under quite a bit of pressure right now...

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.190
If we manage to touch it, we can make it work!

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.490
We're not gonna lose!

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.420
Yeah!

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.320
Aoba Johsai Give it your all!

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.580
But of course.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.540
Well, it's time...

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.620
You have to get it, no matter what!

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.190
Yeah!

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.910
All right!

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.340
All right!
They cut off Oikawa's serves!

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.640
Seijoh's still at match point, though.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:41.590
Karasuno             Aoba Johsai

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.140
The wall for this next point is high.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.590
Whoa, Karasuno loses if they give up another point,

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.050
but they're switching out their libero?

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.390
Sensei.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.060
Right.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:48.980
Yeah!

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.030
This is the last battle.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:09.950
Haikyu!!

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.500
Yeah!

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.820
This is the last battle.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.230
Ooh, now they're going for a strategic one-point six-two!

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.920
Yeah!

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.480
Yeah!

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.940
If they can't do a break, they're done.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.700
Yeah!
We're counting on you!

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.830
Yeah!

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.180
Do what you did in the second set!

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.470
Yeah!

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.920
Suga-san, give us a nice serve!

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.730
Yeah!

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.890
How is able to concentrate so intensely towards the end of the match?

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.140
Though it's just his concentration!

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.580
Huh? Why are you picking a fight with Hinata?!

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.060
We're going to finish it with this one.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.000
Yeah!

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.170
Nice serve!

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.440
Concentrate on the one!

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.080
If I miss this serve, everything is over.
Nice serve! Get one!

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.080
Go!

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.220
If we don't stop the opponent's attack, everything is over.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.720
Here I go!

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.350
Is it in or out?

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.920
Is it going to be me or Iwaizumi-san?!

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.520
Damn, they picked it up!

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.730
But the ace is out.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.080
Center!

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.510
Yeah!
You stopped it!

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.460
Hinata!
Shoyo!

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.100
Well, he is the middle blocker.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.140
He's supposed to be able to block.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.180
I feel bad, really!

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.730
Great job taking that, Kageyama.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.800
Karasuno Aoba Johsai Karasuno caught up!

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.940
It's a deuce!

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.430
Sorry.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.020
Don't mind!

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.150
Next, next!

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.680
Rather than going to stop it,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.070
it was more like he went to jump at the ball, no matter what.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.550
Every time, I'm astonished at the shrimp's quick response.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.220
Suga-san, one more!

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.040
Here I go.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:21.670
Front, front!

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:22.840
Damn it!

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.570
Whoa, that was close!

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:25.900
That barely made it to the front!

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.800
He broke it!

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.470
This time it's Iwaizumi who was off balance.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.530
He may be Mr. Refreshing, Center!

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.970
but his serves aren't refreshing at all!

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.640
Front, front, front!

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.350
Fall!

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.900
I'll get it!

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.110
Yes, yes!

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.570
The first touch was Mr. Refreshing...

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.810
Now they won't be able to do that last attack!

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.160
Go!

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.120
Even if you can't stop it, touch it!

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.960
Bring it to me!

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.040
You little brats!

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.500
Ka...

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.740
Kageyama!

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.580
I know...

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.210
But...

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.400
I won't lose!

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.680
Karasuno Aoba Johsai Just one more point.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.520
You're awesome, Tobio!

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.790
Man, when Sugawara got the first touch,

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.310
I didn't think Kageyama would attack...

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.460
Yeah, but everyone's got the idea that when Sugawara's in the game,

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.610
something's gonna happen.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.610
We just start thinking that way.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.770
Damn, that pisses me off!

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.290
That's definitely Oikawa's junior.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:25.510
He's got a setter's disposition, staying confident in a situation like that.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.540
Seijoh!

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.000
Well, yeah... Seijoh!

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.220
I'd love some of that.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.470
Seijoh!

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.220
Have you found the limits of your abilities?

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.520
Even though your technique, body, and mentality aren't complete?

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.390
People who are naturally better than you

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.310
have been different from you ever since they were born.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.970
It's impossible to turn that around, no matter how hard you work,

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.470
how well you strategize, or who your teammates are.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.820
You can complain about that

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.380
once you've actually done everything you possibly can.

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:17.420
Rather than despairing and giving up because you're not a genius,

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.800
believe that your strength is not limited to this,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.960
and to continue on the path straight ahead of you...

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.540
It may be harsh to say so, but...

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.640
Today might be the day to grasp the chance to let your talent bloom.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.460
Maybe tomorrow, the day after, or next year...

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.910
Maybe even when you're thirty.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.630
I'm not sure if physique has anything to do with it,

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.910
but if you think it'll never come, it probably never will.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.320
Oikawa-san's seems different lately, doesn't he?

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.400
Rule the Court Go, go, go, go, go, go, Seijoh!

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.740
Push it, push it, push it, push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.680
Push it, push it, Karasuno!
Go, go, Karasuno!

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.310
Put everything you've got into it! Do it!

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.310
Hey, say it together!

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.720
If something like that comes up front again, I'll get it.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.120
I'll leave the rest to you.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.080
Right!

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.270
Don't let your guard down.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.810
They might drop it over here again.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.770
Keep your eye on the ball.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.490
Right!

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.640
Make sure you aim for the target!

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.040
I know. If I half-ass it, it'll get hit immediately.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.600
Make sure you at least touch it when you block.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.460
Yeah!

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:35.880
Let's take this back!

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.340
Let's get this one!

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.300
Yeah!

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.010
Karasuno        Aoba Johsai

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.260
Suga-san, nice serve!

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.270
The front!

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.310
Iwaizumi-san!

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.230
All right! He was off balance!

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.450
Damn it!

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.190
Ryu!

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.050
Go!

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.260
Finish it now!

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.420
Hanamaki-san!
They got it!

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:15.420
But...

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.610
It's off!
We're counting on you, Oikawa!

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.300
Chance ball!

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.770
A super-long

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.090
and fast set up from outside the court...

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.450
#4's coming in!

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.620
Talent is something you make bloom.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.250
Instinct is something you polish!

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.600
Right on!

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.800
Damn it!

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.880
Yeah!

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.760
Get the last!

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.180
Six who are strong are stronger!

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.390
Connect!

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.610
Chance ball!

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.780
Like hell... He's gonna hit it from there?!

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.610
...you'll get that chance!

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.100
Kyotani, nice!

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.290
Hit it, Kageyama!

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.920
Damn it. How lame.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.400
Give it to me!

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.310
Come on.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.480
Come at me with your ultimate weapon,

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:53.980
Tobio!

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.880
They read the set up!

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.340
All... ...right!

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.710
Karasuno             Aoba Johsai

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.570
We won! We won!

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:52.160
Shimada... Are you actually crying?

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.380
N-No... My contact lens just shifted.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:01.000
You... wear glasses... Episode 25 "Declaration of War"

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.510
Next time on Haikyu!!: "Declaration of War."
