WEBVTT

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.480
Oh, man! Oh, man!

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.210
Taking off in the middle of the night is pretty exciting!

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.000
Well, you guys were late last time.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.060
Being an idiot must be nice.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.340
You can even sleep on a bus.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.280
What'd you say?!

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.660
We'll be arriving at our destination early in the morning once again.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.840
Ukai-kun and I will take turns driving.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.190
Sorry if I nod off.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.130
Thank you!

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.480
It's the middle of the night, so not so loud.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.340
Oh, sorry... Habit.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.550
Do you guys have everything?

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.800
Make sure you double-check.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.480
It'll go quickly if you fall asleep.
Hinata and Kageyama haven't really talked to each other lately...

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.830
I wonder if I can... I wonder if they'll be okay.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.530
All right, Ryu!

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.440
All right, we're heading out.
Let's show 'em what we're made of!

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440
Heck yeah, Noya-san! Let's do this!

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.560
Just shut up and get on.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.410
Haikyu!!

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.950
Hey, hey! Where's the Skytree?

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.490
Episode 07: Moonrise Huh? The Skytree?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.400
Oh! Is that the Tokyo Tower?!

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.200
Huh?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.910
That's... Just a normal transmission tower.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.240
What the hell?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.480
Are there no transmission towers in Miyagi?

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.510
Pretty sure I've heard that conversation before.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.290
The transmission towers in Tokyo all look like the Tokyo Tower to us countryfolk!

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.760
That's a rash thing to say.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760
Also, we're in Saitama.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.970
So that's not... the Tokyo Tower?

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.280
So we're gonna be at a different school this time?

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.300
Apparently, the summer training camp is always at Shinzen.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.940
It's nice and cool here...

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.930
But lots of bugs around.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.380
Hinata! Did you grow any taller?!

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.490
Lev, shut up.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.430
That's a pretty rude thing to say.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.440
Like I could grow in two weeks!

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.060
I grew two millimeters.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.080
All right.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.440
We're gonna switch out members constantly this time around,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.520
so be prepared.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.550
Right!

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.760
Karasuno             Fukurodani

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.470
Let's try for no penalties!

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.180
Noya-san!

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.890
Yeah!

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.310
Nice receive!

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.600
A chance at a quick...

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.150
That weird quick's coming!

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.360
Just drop it off... Just drop it off...

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.630
Just drop it... off!

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.660
It was too short...

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.650
What the heck?

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.920
That's not like you at all.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.100
I'm sorry.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.920
Damn it...

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.670
It feels different when I'm in an actual match.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.100
All right! One more! Nice serve!
Surprised?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.550
I'm sure you've realized it.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.310
Kageyama's toss is completely different now.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.060
Got it!

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.650
This time, it went too far.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.820
His left hand?

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.700
He immediately tried to save it with his left hand.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.240
Nice, Hinata!

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.710
He used to panic if anything was off.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.480
Nice, Shoyo!

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.800
The toss dropped again...

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.130
He's...

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.340
He's different now.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.720
Don't mind!

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.190
We couldn't help that one!

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.010
We'll get the next one!

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.600
Hinata and Kageyama Fukurodani Karasuno

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.600
aren't the only ones who've changed...

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.430
Out! Out!

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.960
Tsk.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.270
Azumane-san's tsks have so much impact.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.120
That's fine! Keep it going!

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.930
Hmm... Splendid.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.630
They're splendidly...

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.590
Ah!

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.980
Ah!

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.290
...not in synch at all.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.500
Did Karasuno... Sorry!

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.020
...just try to do a synchronized attack?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.530
Sorry! Cover!

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.810
Leave it to me!

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.480
Jumping from the back zone and into a libero's jump toss?

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480
Ah!

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.910
I jumped too far!

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.330
Hey, what's up with those guys today?

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.320
Are you okay?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.870
Damn it!

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.620
Karasuno            Fukurodani
I wonder what happened to Karasuno.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.670
Maybe they're in some kind of rut?

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.540
I think it's the exact opposite.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.510
Because they're crows, they're omnivorous.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.470
It doesn't matter if they're deep in the mountains,

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.340
Kabukicho Ichibangai or in the middle of Kabukicho.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.350
They eat everything there is to eat,

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.130
and take advantage of those stronger than them to survive.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.280
It looks like they're Nice receive!

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.760
Left! Left!

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.070
in the middle of evolving at an incredible speed.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.610
Bokuto-san!

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.950
Yes!

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.280
All of them but one, it seems.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.080
Karasuno Fukurodani Thank you!

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.240
The penalty this time

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.510
is Shinzen's special "refreshing sprint up the grassy hill," apparently.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.440
All right.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.340
Ready... Go!

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.440
Here.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.430
Th-Thanks.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.740
Sugawara-san, here.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.650
Nice serve!

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.820
Shinzen and Ubugawa are still in their first set?

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.570
Yeah.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.120
Their serves are awesome!

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.580
Left!

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.740
Whoa, like, fabam!

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.720
Serve and block.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.280
Destroy the opponent with the serve, then try to limit

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.840
their opponent's attack space and block.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.140
That's the most ideal method of attack next to a service ace.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.160
Serve and block...

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.450
Damn you, Tarako.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.310
Broccoli... Stop that! You're being rude to food.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.730
What?!

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.680
We amazingly lost all our games.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.090
It's actually sort of refreshing.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.090
I haven't done that many sprints since Coach Ukai was coaching.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.280
I'm gonna borrow the tablet from Ukai-san

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.570
so we can review the synchronized attack video.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.100
All right.
Sure thing.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.630
I'm gonna go hit some serves.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.710
I need way more practice.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.710
Serves! I'll hit some, too.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.150
Ah, Tsukki! I'm gonna go hit some serves. Would you—

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.000
I'm gonna go take a bath and go to bed.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.810
I-I see. Um... What?

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.260
I was just wondering

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.370
if you were gonna practice anything on your own...

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.640
We've already been practicing more than anyone wants.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.730
Going all out in practice isn't gonna solve everything.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.600
R-Right...

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.310
That's true, but...

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.810
Oh, hey, you. Karasuno!

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.120
You with the glasses!

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.840
Would you jump some blocks for us?

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.420
Oh, actually, I'm done for the night.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.570
If you'll excuse me.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.220
What?!

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.060
There's no point in practicing spikes without a blocker!

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.600
Come on!

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.910
Why does it have to be me?

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.140
Why not someone from Fukurodani?

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.250
There's no limit to Bokuto-san's spiking practice,

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.110
so everyone runs away pretty quickly.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.620
I'm too busy whipping this guy into shape.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.860
I said I'd jump some blocks!

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.740
Shut up!

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.240
If you want to continue as a regular on Nekoma's team,

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.520
you need to actually be able to receive the ball!

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.710
He may not look it,

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.790
but this guy's one of the top five spikers in the country,

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.670
so it'll be great practice.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.250
So he somehow didn't make it into the top three, huh?

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:38.910
Don't mind.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.100
Don't raise me up just to let me get knocked down!

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.670
Besides, if you're a middle blocker,

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.810
you should practice your blocking a bit more.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.030
Gymnasium #1

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.110
We couldn't get one quick right today.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.790
I need to practice.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.670
If we don't manage to make this somewhat useful by next month...

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.830
We'll be in trouble.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.340
Oh! Are you going to practice quicks?

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.140
Balls? Want some balls?

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.590
Why is she making it sound like she's offering us a drink?

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.280
P-Please!

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.370
Yeah.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:39.570
Haikyu!!

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.740
One more!

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.450
One more!

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.380
One more!

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.960
One more!

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.210
Straight!

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.420
So smart and calm...

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.670
But...

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.500
Yes!

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.710
You just beat all of one blocker.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.840
Shut up!

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.390
Well, how about two, then?

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.560
Bring it on!

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.600
Is he dead?

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.190
Here we go!

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.860
Four eyes, make sure you keep that straight in check!

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.800
Yeah!

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.490
Damn it!

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.370
You know, four eyes, you're great at reading attacks, but...

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.710
Your blocks are pretty weak.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.110
Your arms are so frail that I'm scared I'm gonna break them.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.920
You need to stop the ball like you mean it!

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.440
I'm still a growing boy!

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.540
I've just started gaining muscle and getting taller.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:53.180
Talk like that, and the little shrimp is gonna hog all the glory.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.600
You guys play the same position, right?

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.320
Huh?

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.620
I don't think that can be helped.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.530
The difference in natural talent between me and Hinata is too great.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.100
Ah! Are you practicing spikes again?!

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.280
Want me to block?! I can block!

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.480
Hey, Lev!

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.300
Get your ass off the ground! Time to receive!

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.280
Gah! Yaku-san!
What do you mean, "Gah"?!

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.880
Come on, get up! You rested long enough.
Well, looks like I'll be in the way,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.290
so if you'll excuse me.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.000
Yeah, I'm totally set!
Hey!

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.460
So I'm ready for some blocking practice...

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.600
Looks like you stepped on a mine, Kuroo-san.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.600
Oh? Then let's see what you've got.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.050
You pissed him off.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.960
At long last, Kuroo-kun, the master of provocation, has failed.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.390
Well, I wouldn't have thought that... Thought what?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:42.240
The Unknown

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.380
Karasuno's Shrimp is definitely strange and a threat,

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.590
but in terms of technique and experience, he's like a baby bird.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.240
Plus he's really short.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.950
I never would've thought guy with glasses, who's far taller and much smarter,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.390
would not only think they're not equal,

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.980
but actually think the shrimp is above his level.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.340
Damn it. I forgot my pads.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.040
Gymnasium #1

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.510
One more! One more!

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.410
I think the timing's a bit too fast.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:08.180
Really? Then I'll slow it down one tempo next.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.330
Here we go!

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.050
Sorry. One more.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.390
This is just a club.
Right.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.080
Let's go!

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.300
Why do you put so much into it?

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.940
It's because you put so much into it

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.140
that you suffer later.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.500
Cafeteria Hey, Tsukishima.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.960
Eat up! Or you're not gonna last!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.080
Nishinoya-san... At least your stomach's big.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.710
What'd you say?! You little brat!

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.000
Here.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.130
Th-Thank you!
Your true self will pay!

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:51.430
H-Hey! Stop! They're gonna break.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.470
Hey, Daichi's gonna get mad!

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.310
Karasuno               Nekoma

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.190
Go!

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.030
Go!

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.530
Go!

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:19.980
Here you go, Hinata.
Thanks!

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.290
Everyone!

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:27.840
Fukurodani                                                                                             Fukurodani
Ubugawa

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.780
The parents from Shinzen High gave us some watermelons!

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.220
Whoa! That's awesome, Lev!

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.300
Can I get one more?

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.040
Sure.
Thanks.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.100
Huh? Tsukishima-kun, is one slice enough?

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.900
Yeah. Thanks for the food.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.160
I ate way too much once and got a stomachache.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.990
Sorry, by the way.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.420
About what?

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.770
I think I might have pissed off your glasses guy yesterday.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.330
What?

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.840
Wow... Tsukishima actually helped out with free practice.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.780
Hinata, you suck.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.290
Even if you cornered him into it...

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.380
So, what did you say?

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.010
I provoked him and said he was going to lose to your shrimp over there.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.850
I've definitely noticed that Tsukishima seems to feel inferior to Hinata somehow.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.430
It's Hinata's job to steal the spotlight.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.860
It's my job to keep trouble from happening

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.770
while Hinata's rotated into the rear guard.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.090
It's the usual situation, isn't it?

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.820
I'm not sure if this is relevant, but my sister...

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.270
By the way... Huh?

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.580
I thought I heard the name during your training camp matches,

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.140
but does Karasuno have a guy named Tsukishima right now?

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.750
Yeah.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.740
The glasses kid. He's a pompous little shit.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.200
Do you know if that Tsukishima has an older brother?

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.030
Huh?

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.340
No idea. He's not the type that'd mention that himself.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.060
When I was at Karasuno,

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.100
the same time the boys' volleyball team was the strongest...

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.320
When the Little Giant was there?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.770
Yeah. I thought there was

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.270
a really tall guy named Tsukishima back then, too.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.360
Huh?

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.840
Tsukishima has an older brother?

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.860
Oh, but I'm not sure.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.340
They could just have the same last name and not be related.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.120
Hey, we're about to start!

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.500
Right. Let's go.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:19.960
Yeah.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.690
Oh, sorry. One sec...

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.750
Karasuno Nekoma Go!

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.850
This is rough... Not at all!

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.790
I can still do at least ten rounds!

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.180
Uh, how about we win?

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:50.200
Yamaguchi, your serve's getting much better.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.780
Th-Thank you very much.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.240
I have to improve my success rate.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.220
Doesn't it bother you, Azumane-san?

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:58.950
What?

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.200
That feeling of immense talent creeping up behind you.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.630
Yeah, well... I guess I can say I'm not at ease.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:12.140
I'm sure Hinata's still obsessing over the title of ace.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.420
That might be true.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.530
Maybe that's why he said he had to change.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.140
But because of that, it seems that all of us got fired up, too.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.940
If you're not careful,

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.080
Hinata's probably gonna bite you again because he's too focused.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.150
Oh, you mean when we both went to spike and he jumped into me.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.720
We're in the same boat.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.360
Our positions kind of make Hinata our rival,

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.620
so we probably notice more than others

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.920
how much he's grown from the baby bird he used to be.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.280
But I don't plan on losing to him.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.450
Left! Left!

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.760
All right!
Karasuno                         Ubugawa

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.340
Hey, you totally slacked there.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.720
You need to at least jump!

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.310
Well, aren't you alert. My bad.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.580
Tsukishima, it's your serve next.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.890
Sensei, what do you think of Tsukishima?

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.250
Right.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.020
I think he's taking this seriously.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.940
Nice serve!

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.220
I feel like Tsukishima gets a passing grade,

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.530
but never tries for 100%.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.300
It's coming left! Left!

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.240
I'm not asking for him to become more passionate,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:18.900
Cover! Cover!

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.240
#4! #4!

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.480
but if he not going to give his all,

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.990
I'm gonna have to change regulars.
Nice receive!

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.160
Center!
Left!

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.710
I need players who can win a match on the court.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.300
He's the tallest and essential to the team.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.800
All right!

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.320
If Tsukishima could become a strong blocker,

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.440
our defense level would go up a lot.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.670
I see.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.340
Cover! Cover!

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.840
Karasuno Ubugawa Leave it to me!

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.840
Got it!

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.320
Sorry!
I'm so sorry!

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.580
Everyone's so motivated.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.360
Everyone's more motivated now than I've ever seen them before,

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.470
but sometimes it's almost scary.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.570
Collisions like the one other day can definitely lead to major injuries.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.160
It's coming on the left! #1!

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.760
We're counting on you, Asahi-san!

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.910
It's a bit short...

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.900
It's my ball!

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.890
Better than expected...

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.460
Whether you're on the same team or not,

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.320
the tension you feel as rivals is essential for growth.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.960
Nice kill, Asahi-san!

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.540
That was an awesome spike!

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.320
Thanks.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.320
However, if the team became lawless, everything would be lost.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.320
Karasuno's ace managed to hold them together.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.540
Maybe I didn't need to worry after all.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.920
Go!

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.710
You okay, Tsukki?

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.930
You can go on ahead. I'm fine.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.310
Okay. Then I'll go...

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.500
More free practice!

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.490
Another magnificent total loss today.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.080
He's as standoffish as usual.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.340
Tsukishima?

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.350
Yeah.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:38.940
It really seems like he'd be able to do much more if he tried, right?

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.410
Much more?

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.050
Yeah, a lot more...

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.800
His 188 centimeters is such a waste!

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.420
Hey, four eyes.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.780
Would you help us out with spiking practice again?

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.450
I'm sorry. I'll pass.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.530
Oh. Oh, really? Kuroo.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.060
Aw, man... I haven't even said anything yet!

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.130
Why?! You know the ace from Fukurodani?!

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.220
No.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.480
Why did you refuse? That's such a waste!

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.840
Shut up.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.800
Unlike you, I don't have endless stamina.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.910
What the heck?

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.960
What's Tsukishima's problem?

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.360
The ace from Fukurodani invited him to practice and he declined?

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.080
That's unbelievable!

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.080
You know, Hinata...

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.800
What would you say to Tsukki right now?

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.550
Huh?

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.740
I mean... Like you did with Kageyama and Yachi-san.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.510
I wouldn't say anything.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.370
Well, I can't tell if Tsukishima even wants to play volleyball.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:45.000
There's no point in trying to get a guy to play if he doesn't want to.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.440
Damn it! And he's so tall, too!

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.140
If I was that tall, I'd do this and that... Tsukki...

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.350
...doesn't hate volleyball, I don't think.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.550
If he did, he wouldn't have come to Karasuno.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.410
What about you, Yamaguchi?

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.890
What would you say to Tsukishima?

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.280
Lev! Show me how to spit watermelon seeds really far!

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.340
First, you purse your lips like you've got a blowgun.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.420
The angle you're gonna spit is 45 degrees.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:53.700
I see!

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.660
And then you bring back your body like a whip, and...

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.830
I accidentally swallowed them!

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.580
