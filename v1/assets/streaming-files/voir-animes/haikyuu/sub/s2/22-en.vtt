WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Great, great, Issei! Push it, push it, Issei! One more time!

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.520
Karasuno                 Wakunan

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.990
Sorry... I'm gonna go to the bathroom...

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.560
So go on ahead.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.890
He's really pumped about going to the bathroom.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.000
He must need to take a shit.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.060
Say "poop!" You're so vulgar, Kageyama-kun!

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.810
Crap.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.480
I don't think he actually went to the bathroom...
Poop.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.480
Crap.
Poop.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.950
Crap.
Poop!

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.420
Ukai-san...

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.010
I'm sorry for wasting my chance.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.640
"How effectively you serve

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.950
will determine if you can win or not."

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.800
I heard your direction during the Fukurodani match and understood it...

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.230
And I understood my role.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.420
And then I thought I wanted to be able to fight, too...

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.140
But...

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.320
I ran away at the last minute.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.440
Please...

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.590
Give me one more chance.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.420
Oh, shut up already. I know.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.100
Please put me in.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.910
Haikyu!!

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.700
Kyotani, get one more in!

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.800
Sorry! It's long!

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.780
Mattsun!

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.080
Episode 22: "The Former Coward's Fight"

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.080
All right!

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.080
Damn it. Sorry!

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.040
Aoba Johsai Karasuno This isn't good.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.070
Seijoh's #16 is finding his groove.
Great, great, Issei! Push it, push it, Issei! One more time!

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.760
They're ahead by five... Karasuno, fight!

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.700
Let's move back a little.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.170
He's probably not going to drop it up front.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.040
Yeah.
Right.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.180
Nice serve!

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.720
Bring it, bring it, bring it...

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.350
Tanaka!

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.440
Yeah!

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.900
Yeah!

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.610
Aoba Johsai Karasuno It's only just begun!

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.820
Shoyo, nice serve!

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.190
Hey! That guy...

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.330
Pardon me. We're switching players.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.650
Oh, there he is. The scaredy cat pinch server.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.970
Right. The guy who was in the match with Wakunan, too.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.720
Though I totally understand getting freaked out.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.680
I would hate having to serve during a pinch.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.420
He's the one that got all stiff and failed miserably last time, right?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.050
Yeah... Yamaguchi, get 10 points!

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.980
That'd end the match...

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.690
I'd forgive you.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.770
G-Give it to 'em good, Yamaguchi!

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.720
R-Remain calm... Calm.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.850
Nice serve!

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.870
Nice serve.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.890
Give it your all!

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.710
Right!

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.460
One, and...

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.880
Yamaguchi, one more! Nice serve!

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.930
Eight seconds...

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.270
You know there's time after the whistle blows for you to serve, right?

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.290
Yes.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.120
You basically get freaked out by the whistle and then

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.690
do your serve toss almost every time.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.200
Don't be so panicky.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.780
Yes... Well, all that's left is this.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.580
You went to Ukai's, right?

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.580
Yes.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.700
On your own.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.630
Then you're already a completely different player.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.860
Go out there and do what you want to do.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.480
All of their players have the nerve to get serious...

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.260
Out!

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.690
All right!

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.860
All... ...right!

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.990
He did it... Tadashi!

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.990
Nice serve!

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.990
It got in!

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.530
We're... ...supposed to be...

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.000
...cheering for Aoba Johsai.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.620
Wait, what? Isn't that a bit overboard?
Yamaguchi, nice serve!

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.210
That's just one point.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.830
That's it! Get one more!

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.220
A no-touch ace!

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.780
Go and catch up!

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.720
I'm sorry.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.600
Don't mind! Don't worry about it.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.260
It changed a lot... Even I thought it was out.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.320
This is why I hate jump floats.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.580
That was awesome, Yamaguchi! Why, you little...

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.390
R-Right... It's not that surprising.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.000
There you go again... In these five months,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.460
he practiced serving more than anyone else.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.920
Why you little...

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.090
Aoba Johsai                         Karasuno
Yamaguchi, one more!

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.440
Give it all you've got!

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.770
Give it all you've got, Yamaguchi!

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:36.950
He'll be fine.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.890
You always feel worse after you run away.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.060
I'm pretty sure Yamaguchi feels that way, too.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:54.570
A shot to break through the skin... Yeah, and...

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.620
The start of our counterattack.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.980
Cut it off!
Yeah.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.460
In volleyball, where it's important to connect with your teammates,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.990
the serve is the only solitary play.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.960
Yeah...

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.920
It can also be said that it's the only play where you can score on your own.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.150
As volleyball evolved,

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.110
the serve's power and motive has evolved more than anything else.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.400
And in modern volleyball, the serve is a powerful attack

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.360
that won't get caught by the wall known as the block.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.200
Kyotani!

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.910
Damn it!

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.830
A s-second service ace!

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.340
Yes!

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.470
All right!

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.510
Yamaguchi!
Nice serve.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.220
What the heck is that serve? That was awesome.
Yamaguchi-kun!

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.910
Yamaguchi!

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.430
One more!

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.600
Bring it!

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.330
Got it!

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.440
You catch jump floats

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.940
with an over-handed hit!

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.540
Makki, nice.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.410
He picked it up! They're going to attack.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.740
This fear when you change from being the hunter to becoming the hunted...

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.440
Iwaizumi!

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.210
He received it with his body?!

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.420
Not yet... Not yet.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.840
I'm not going to let you serve just yet!

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.380
Cover!

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.470
Thanks, Kageyama...

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.430
Tsukishima, get the last!

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.770
All right!

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.030
Tsukki... A wipe!

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.530
They used that block really well.
Tsukishima!

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.240
Aoba Johsai                             Karasuno
Now they've gotten three consecutive points.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.080
One more.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.750
Yeah!

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.700
Oh? Seijoh's taking a time out.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.090
They're physically stopping the momentum.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.470
All right!

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.200
Making Seijoh take a time out is amazing, Yamaguchi!

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.870
Yamaguchi!
Th-Thank you...

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.390
That #12... made a really bold receive.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.520
That was just luck, though.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.150
Wow...

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.310
It hurts a lot...

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.450
All right! Let's win this!

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.910
Keep it up!

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.920
I want to be able to control my body like the other guys!

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.880
I want to be able to control the ball!

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.390
I want to fight head-on with strong opponents!

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.300
All right!

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.850
Yamaguchi!

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.510
One more!

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.530
Keep your eye on the ball!

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.220
Right!

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.730
Listen up, Tadashi.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.710
You can't give them the chance to take the ball.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.400
Aim straight through, as close as you can get to the white...

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.110
...and hit!

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.040
I only have one weapon:

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.620
my serve.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.540
The chance I received is just one service chance.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.970
I'm going to fight putting my pride and the flow of the game into that shot.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.930
I am...

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.420
a pinch server.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.990
It's in!

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.800
Is luck on our side now?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.830
No, it's not just that.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.560
Now...

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.820
Aoba Johsai Karasuno We're tied.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:26.550
Haikyu!!

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.600
Aoba Johsai Karasuno Now they're tied!

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.100
Karasuno caught up!

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.700
Yamaguchi!

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.520
That same net drop happened during the Wakunan match, too, right?

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.520
Tadashi's a lucky boy!

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.920
Yup, yup!

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.720
It might be a net drop,

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.990
but it's completely different from the one during the Wakunan match.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.710
During the Wakunan match, Yamagauchi, one more!

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:51.940
Tadashi was thinking about whether or not the ball would go in.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.830
Yamaguchi, nice serve!

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.960
Right now, he's thinking about

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.300
where he's going to serve it.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.460
This net drop was a result of switching to offense.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.790
How awesome, Tadashi!

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:07.340
Though I'm sure he's entirely comfortable with that.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.330
One more, Yamaguchi!

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.500
The serve toss keeps getting really low.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.770
Right!

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:15.980
Let's calm down, now.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.600
I am calm.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.060
That one couldn't be helped.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.160
We'll get the next one.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.720
That's it, you guys!

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.200
You guys are too great. It makes your captain sad.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.260
It's got a loose spin!

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.460
It's not changing direction!

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.630
Got it!

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.970
Nice receive!

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.220
One-touch!

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.600
Nice one-touch!

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.110
Azumane-san!

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.230
Nice, Kageyama!

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.230
Three blockers!

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.440
And a very high block...

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.570
Back!

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.260
Out!

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.580
All right!

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.080
Tanaka, nice call!
H-Hey, seriously?

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:22.250
They... Aoba Johsai Karasuno

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.770
Karasuno's at match point!

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.060
One more! Nice serve!

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.460
Yamaguchi-kun...

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.440
...is the hero of this match.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:30.810
Just one more point...

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.140
Just one more point and we win!

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.240
Get it in! Please, get it in!

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.350
Tadashi!

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.840
Yamaguchi! Just one more!

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.940
Get it in there!

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.120
Feels good...

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.290
I'll get it!

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.830
Damn it, they're good.
Nice, Watacchi!

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.670
Stop it!
Stop it, please!

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.810
All right!

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.750
Nice kill!

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:21.930
Great, great, Hajime! Push it, push it, Hajime! One more time!

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.170
We finally cut it off...

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.520
How many points did he get, anyway?

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.240
That was magnificent!

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.230
Good job!

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.570
Thank you.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.650
You did great, Yamaguchi!
All right!

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.020
Thanks!

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.030
That was awesome!

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.870
Concentrate on the one!

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.310
Next time,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.480
I'll get 10 points.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.260
I'm not gonna lose!

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.860
Hanamaki, nice serve!
The chance that Yamaguchi gave us...

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.080
Daichi-san!

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.710
We're not gonna let it go to waste!

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.230
All right!

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.190
Nice, Azumane!

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.080
They're there again!

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.400
Match point!

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.820
Go!

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.190
All right!

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.320
They got it back so easily.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.640
They managed a quick even though they're being cornered right now.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.120
Not to mention, right up front.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.000
If it were me, I'd be relying on the ace.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Yeah!

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.960
Aoba Johsai                  Karasuno

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.960
Nice receive!

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.920
There're two!

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.810
All right!

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.410
Tsukishima, nice kill!

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.110
Hey, your movements are stiff, Kindaichi.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.480
Yes! No!

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.470
Which is it?

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.970
This is a critical moment for us.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.440
We can't make this the third-years' last match.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.690
Don't think about anything unnecessary.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.720
No matter what, you only need to focus on

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.260
the ball in front of you.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.160
Right!

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.230
Asahi, get this!

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.700
Nice serve!

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.840
It's long! Get this!

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.340
Great, great, Yutaro. Push it, push it, Yutaro! One more time!

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.720
All right!

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.760
Nice kill!

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.840
Thanks!

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.140
I guess that's to be expected of Seijoh.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.920
The next one is going to be huge.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.810
But...

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.190
And...

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.570
...in modern volleyball, the serve is a powerful attack

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.280
that won't get caught by

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.760
the wall known as the block.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.140
That was basically a spike...

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:12.480
All right!

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.440
Great, great, Toru! Push it, push it, Toru! One more time!

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.910
Aoba Johsai                      Karasuno

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.050
Seijoh turned it around into a set point!

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.910
Are they going to get the set?

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.370
Damn it!

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.330
This isn't possible with just the two of us.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.470
Asahi, please. We're counting on you.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.280
Yeah.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.250
Azumane-kun's going to be receiving the serve, too?

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.690
If that's what Sawamura and Nishinoya decided,

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.340
then that's probably best.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:42.380
It appears that Oikawa's serves focus more on power than control.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.080
Rather than them scoring a no-touch,

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.050
touching and getting the ball up in any way is better.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.900
We received plenty of Ubugawa's and Fukurodani's serves.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.770
It's okay. We can fight.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.820
Bring it!

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.030
Nice serve!

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.620
Daichi-san!

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.620
Good!

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.380
Tanaka, nice!

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.590
Kageyama!

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.640
Asahi!

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.780
Asahi-san!

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.470
Nice receive!

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.910
All right!

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.370
Aoba Johsai                 Karasuno

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.770
They got the set back.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.080
I thought Karasuno was just going to win straight through.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.520
And we had them cornered!

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.520
Don't mind!

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.970
We're just getting started!

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:58.050
Damn it! That third set is gonna be rough!

00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.560
Let's change it up!

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.260
Right!

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.060
His serve really is amazing.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.030
You were awesome, too, Yamaguchi.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.140
He's much more experienced than I am.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.720
That might be obvious because he's a third-year,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.770
but I don't think that's the only thing.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.220
Not the only thing?

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:20.490
A jump serve is a serve that balances a lot of power with a high risk.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.860
To be able to add force to his serve

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.240
and still have it land in when they were cornered like that...

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.120
He's something special.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.330
Yamaguchi!

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.240
Those were nice serves!

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.580
Th-Thanks.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.020
But I've still got a ways to go.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.220
Only half of my serves were any good.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.610
Then be super happy about the half that were good!

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.220
Even if you put aside regret, you'll end up feeling it anyway.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.340
Right now, you need to make sure you grasp this good feeling

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.940
and never forget it.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.110
Grasp really hard.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.820
And do it again next time, too.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.180
Yes!

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.580
So we ended up getting a full set...

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.760
Our first practice match,

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:27.510
the Inter-High prelims...

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.900
And now...

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.130
We're having our most intense match yet.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.910
Difficult opponents...

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.660
Troublesome opponents...

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.920
We didn't even have much of a connection with them until last year...

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.420
They were supposed to be beneath us...

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.420
But apparently we're fated to play to the fullest.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.100
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:15.560
The final set... Rule the Court Fly

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.070
This is our last battle!

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.080
That was amazing, Yamaguchi-kun!

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.240
Th-Thank you very much, Yachi-san.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.090
Just in case, I had an AED, stretcher, and coffin prepared,

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.660
but they weren't necessary at all!

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.080
Huh?! Wasn't there something that didn't belong at the end there?

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.540
Episode 23: "Team"

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.040
Next time on Haikyu!!:"Team."
