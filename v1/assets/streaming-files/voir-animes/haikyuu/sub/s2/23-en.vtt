00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.880
Rule the Court I'm sure you're sick of hearing this,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.730
Seijoh!
but make sure you serve strong.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.860
It can't be helped if their #10 scores some points.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.240
Seijoh!
Limit his path and pick up the ball.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.240
Right!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.990
You guys are strong.
Seijoh!

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.740
Yeah!

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.000
Seijoh!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.460
Fly

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.140
Just remember, don't let Oikawa do whatever he wants with his serves.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.600
Just get it up. Get it up, no matter what.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.000
Then, someone will connect.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.720
Right!

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.040
If an enemy you must defeat one day is called an archenemy,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.660
then for Karasuno, Aoba Johsai is indeed that.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.220
You are going to be the ones

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.090
who are going to win this battle against your archenemy.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.110
Yeah!

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.700
The final set...

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.240
We're going to surpass Aoba Johsai.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.330
We're going to surpass them with this team!

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.000
Karasuno, fight!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.670
Yeah!

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.360
Haikyu!!

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.720
Episode 23: "Team"
This is finally it... Yeah...

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.680
The set where they settle things with Seijoh.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.840
Nice serve!

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.380
Go, Asahi!

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.700
All right!

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.660
Oikawa-san, nice serve!

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.110
Get it up... Get it up, no matter what.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.330
We can't let them gain the lead this early.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.280
Please! Cut them off with this one!

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.300
That speed... It's past the net! It's coming direct!

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.050
It's right in front of me, but my reaction's delayed.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.050
Kyotani! Direct!

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.640
All right!

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.400
Great, great, Kentaro! Push it, push it, Kentaro. One more time!

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.820
Good. It looks like Mad Dog-chan's engine's still warmed up.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.900
Oikawa's serves are definitely a problem.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.120
Please... Cut them off.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.540
Karasuno, fight!

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.930
Oikawa, one more! Nice serve!

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.840
All right!

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.050
It's up!

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.230
Cover!

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.730
Yeah!

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.770
Tanaka, nice kill!

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.910
They somehow managed to stop it.
Thanks!

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.440
Ryu, well done!

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.640
All right!

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.560
Tsukishima! You're serving next!

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.780
Oh, right.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.580
Aoba Johsai                 Karasuno
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.620
Got it!

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.330
Mad Dog-chan!

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.500
Yeah!

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.960
Great, great, Kentaro! Push it, push it, Kentaro! One more time.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.930
Nice kill!

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.100
Kyotani has a lot more energy when he's on the front line.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.820
Hopefully he'll be able to keep it up until the end.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.370
An ace with both power and technique...

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.310
Not only is his attack powerful,

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.100
but that #16 is also a troublesome decoy.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.940
And then Oikawa's serves that rack up points...

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.630
If we can't counter those, it's going to break us.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.690
Both of us are high in ability.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.960
The more we struggle for dominance,

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.830
the more fatal the consequences will be

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.500
when one of us loses our balance.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.140
Rule the Court Hang on and don't let go!

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.040
All right!

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.010
Aoba Johsai                  Karasuno

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.010
The final set's also really close.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.710
But no one's taken a significant lead yet.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.100
They've got to fight real hard not to get left behind right now.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.420
Asahi! Get this one!

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.450
Yeah!

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.430
N—

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.660
Nice course!

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.870
There's no way you could have gotten that one.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.870
We'll get the next one!

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.590
Aoba Johsai               Karasuno
Asahi, one more! Nice serve!

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.340
Yeah.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.930
Nice receive!

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.330
Yeah!

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.390
Damn it...

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.770
And there he is again.
Oikawa, nice serve!

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.040
Yes! Now score and cut off Oikawa's serves!

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.660
Chance ball! Tanaka!

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.590
Yeah!

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.000
A quick's coming!

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.060
Nice receive!

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.670
Kyotani, get the last!

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.380
Right! Right!

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.540
Tanaka-san...

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.680
Blocked out!

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.730
All right! They cut it off!
Yes!

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.810
Nice block!

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.750
Tsukki and Tanaka switched up blocks just now.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.480
Yeah.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.940
Did they read that a straight was coming?

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.190
Great job, Tsukishima!

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.030
I knew it...

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.740
Tanaka was getting into it with that #16, right?

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.580
You mean he was picking a fight?

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:15.870
Like in the second set,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.710
he kept targeting their #16 and wiping.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.080
There was no block for a cross,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.660
so he went for the more narrow straight... right by #16.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.970
Seriously? I didn't notice.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.510
It looks like their #16 is fighting back,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.680
and hitting straights on the side where Tanaka is.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.850
I think Tsukishima also figured that out.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.890
Great job reading that, Tsukishima!

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.520
How'd you come up with that?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.970
It was nothing.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.760
This is a chance to gain momentum.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.780
Don't let it go to waste!

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.810
Got it!

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.080
Nice receive.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.880
That #16's coming!

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.660
Get it back yourself.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:03.960
Out!

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.320
All right!
Yes! Here it is!

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.930
Aoba Johsai                   Karasuno
Yeah! They turned it around!

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.940
Keep it up!
Yeah!

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.620
I think that they managed to rile up #16 pretty well.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.880
Don't tell me Ryu did that on purpose!

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.150
No, Ryu may have been challenging him, but that wasn't his goal.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.880
That's just his nature.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.020
So it's like Tsukishima was able to take advantage of that nature.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.330
Now we see a crack in the apparently infallible Seijoh.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.700
This is our chance to break through!

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.760
We're gonna push forward!

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.280
Yeah!

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:12.030
Haikyu!!

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.860
Who's that? A high school kid?

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.920
Apparently, he just wants to practice.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.220
I saw him in another group on Saturday.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.710
If he's in high school, doesn't he have club activities?

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.060
He's probably the type that doesn't get along with the rest of the club.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.850
Is he going through his rebellious stage?

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.420
I'm surprised he's playing a team sport.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.960
I'm sure he's playing because there's something he likes about it.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.230
Ah, Kiyoshi-san. Hi.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.390
Otherwise, he wouldn't be practicing here like this.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:56.110
Japan! Japan! Japan! Japan!

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.960
W-Well, we always need people, so I think it's okay.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.940
Not to mention, he's better than us.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.550
Wha?!

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.560
I wouldn't lose to him!

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.360
Aw, you're all mad.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.380
Shut up.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.440
Tsukishima, one more! Nice serve!

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:34.940
Got it!

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.650
Mad Dog-chan!

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.070
All right!

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.280
Aoba Johsai                  Karasuno
The time out didn't help, did it?

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.320
I don't think so.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.460
Seijoh's got plenty of players, so why don't they switch?

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.960
Switch!

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.160
Hey.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.060
Go, Iwa-chan. Now.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.260
Calm down if you want to get back out on the court.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.040
Hurry up and pull yourself together.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.670
We don't have anything left after this.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.290
Shut up. Like I care.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.500
All right!

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.100
Yahaba, don't push him too much.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.400
Sorry, but no.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.960
You let the opponent provoke you,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.020
got pissed off, and then fizzled out.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.330
Talk about lame.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.060
Ah?

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.820
You had the nerve to come back,

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.730
and then got to go right into a match.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.390
Some guys who have a problem with that.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.060
Like me.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:02.940
But...

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.450
It's not like he caused a problem,

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.920
so I guess it doesn't matter as long as we can use him in a match.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.450
Will he be able to keep up at practice?

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.420
He'll have blanks to fill in.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.710
Including communication.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.130
Well...

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.910
Those aren't the moves of someone who hasn't been practicing.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:34.480
I thought he was pretty cold, both to you and to us.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.180
But that's not the problem.
Left!

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.030
The players we need in order to win are chosen as regulars.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.180
One-touch!
Cover! Cover!

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:40.830
Got it!

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.980
You were chosen...

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.230
So do your job right.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.400
I think Yahaba's gonna get bitten.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.350
Hope he's okay.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.240
You go stop him.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.830
Nope.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.210
Well, that's just a front.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.390
If you track dirt onto our senpais' stage,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.970
I'll never forgive you.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.630
You...

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.350
I thought you were more shallow than that.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.430
You're not wrong there.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.990
I may be shallow, but I respect our senpais.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.450
As long as you're on the court, any point won or lost belongs to the team.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.340
So come on. Help us out.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.350
Got it!

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.430
Center!

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:42.650
Kunimi-chan!

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.240
Kunimi's attack is... possibly...

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.580
A feint!

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.120
Ryu!

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.840
All right!
Aoba Johsai Karasuno Nice kill!

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.020
Good job reading that, Kageyama.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:01.690
Thanks.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.800
Huh? I guess he's back.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.780
So he's coming back... That was fast.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.690
I'm sure it's a gamble for Seijoh, though.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.250
All right!

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.870
Out! Out!

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.970
All right!

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.610
D-Don't mind!

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.680
Uwamushi Jr High         Minamisan Jr High

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.770
He's not doing well today.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.680
What should we do?

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.880
No one's got more power than he does, either...

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.360
But if the situation gets any worse,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.900
he's going to get really annoying.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.980
Let's see how things go.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.920
Tanaka, nice serve!

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.450
Yes.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.910
Nice receive!

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.370
Mad Dog-chan!

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.500
Oikawa's a total sadist.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.460
Absolute trust with no words involved...

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:14.680
It's been a while since you started coming here, Lone Wolf High School Kid.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.170
I heard you were in Aoba Johsai.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.540
That's a pretty strong school.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.290
I actually couldn't get into that school.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.720
Running away from the team,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.740
and practicing elsewhere without rest...

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.490
You're sure taking the easy way out.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:34.410
What?!

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.860
A team is reliable and also annoying, at times.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.210
They're strong allies, yet cause a lot of stress.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.590
You can't even deal with that,

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.340
and you think you're playing volleyball?

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.850
You need to face the team, and have the team face you.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.860
If you're able to do that, you'll both clash and become even stronger.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.050
All right!

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.020
And if you're able to do that, just know that you're lucky.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.680
Teams like that don't exist everywhere.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.910
All right!

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.580
Looks like a great team.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.420
Make sure you face them properly.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.590
Sorry! I'll get the next one!

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.630
Yeah!

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.090
Aoba Johsai                Karasuno
Kyotani, you're serving next.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.160
Nice hit.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.990
Yeah.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.300
If that #16 was in Karasuno,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.660
I wonder what I'd do in this situation.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.460
Oikawa...

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.080
He truly is amazing and terrifying.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.710
All right, let's get this one!

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.720
Yeah!

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.580
With that play, it appears as though their oddball #16

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.750
now fits in with the rest of the team.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.630
That's not good.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.550
We haven't lost

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.030
when it comes to our strength as a team.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.510
We've only just begun.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:23.480
Yeah.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.020
Kyotani, nice serve!

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.280
Ryu!

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:32.640
Yeah!

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.720
Nice receive!

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.740
Watacchi, nice!

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.980
Counter!

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.630
All right!

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.620
Damn it... Aoba Johsai Karasuno

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.030
They're tied!

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.620
Seijoh caught up!

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.580
Kyotani, one more!

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.340
All right!

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.560
Chance ball!

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.260
Hit it, Asahi!

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.940
Damn it... Sorry.
All right!

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.400
You're awesome, Asahi-san.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.730
It got totally knocked out.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.060
Thanks!

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.020
Who's the senpai here?

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.010
With Hinata's spike,

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:24.210
if the course is narrowed or read, it'll get picked up.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:24.910
Yeah...

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.870
We have to use Hinata better...

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.290
All right!

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.300
Karasuno             Aoba Johsai

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.490
Geh, again?

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.600
I feel like my lifespan get shorter
Oikawa, one more! Nice serve!

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.710
every time Oikawa-kun's time to serve comes around.
Oikawa-san, we're counting on you!

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.920
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.690
I'm sure everyone on this side feels that way...

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.190
We're almost done with the middle of the set...

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.540
Losing a lot of points right now would be fatal.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.600
Stop him now!

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.360
Bring it!

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.720
Daichi-san!

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.500
I can't believe he got that.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.810
Chance ball!

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:11.960
Damn it!

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.670
A quick is coming!

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.880
Kindaichi!

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.170
Don't mind!

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.940
If you have a request, tell me!

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:28.270
If I tell Oikawa-san, he'll figure it out and if I don't, he won't get it.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.440
Say, Oikawa-san.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.250
With that one, it's a bit hard to sync or like, uh...

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.280
Okay, got it.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.780
But try again without changing anything.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.110
Again?

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.870
Your point of impact,

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.580
is about one ball's length ahead..

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.920
Great, great, Yutaro! Push it, push it, Yutaro! One more time!

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:52.500
Yes!

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.550
A really sharp wipe...

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.710
Kindachi's movements are different from the Inter-High.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.890
Don't mind! We'll stop it with this one!

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.180
Concentrate!

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.420
Karasuno Aoba Johsai Break!

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.890
We're in the latter half and Seijoh's turning it around.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.220
It's now an all-out war between the teams.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:11.980
Yes...

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.360
And the one that brings the whole Aoba Johsai team up

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.930
is Oikawa-kun, right?
Oikawa-san, one more! Nice serve!

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.010
Yeah, I know, Sensei.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.430
Our team's even stronger than this.
Bring it!

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.430
Come on!

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.430
Oikawa-san, one more! Nice serve!

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.670
Sorry!
Tsukishima, get it!

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:37.920
Push through, Kindaichi!

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.510
All right!

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.710
Thanks, Tsukishima!

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.180
Tsukishima, you're serving next!

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.990
Go wild out there, Shoyo!

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.140
Right!

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.850
Cut it off with this one!

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.320
Yeah!

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.660
The Great King really is amazing.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.980
Do you really understand that?

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.460
I can at least tell something is amazing about him.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.600
But!

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.420
If I'm here, you're invincible.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.080
That's super awesome.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.610
Seriously...

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.960
All of your spikes kept getting picked up, so what are you talking about?

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.620
What'd you say?!

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.050
Baseless courage... Nice.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.040
Th-There is though... there's base.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.710
All right!

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.430
Nice receive!

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.580
Mad Dog-chan!

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.280
Nice one-touch!

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.780
Got it!

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.740
Bring it to me!

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.330
I flew too far forward... The net's super close.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.380
Isn't the toss a bit close to the net?!

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.720
It's basically right above the net!

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.900
No one's there!

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.900
Up front!
Slam it down!

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.820
We're playing the final set, score 17 to 16...

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.210
It's really close.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:51.820
Yeah.
We're gonna win, no matter what!

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.310
Yeah.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.530
Bring it all to me!

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:58.160
Next time on Haikyu!!: "The Absolute Limit Switch."

Episode 24 "The Absolute Limit Switch"
