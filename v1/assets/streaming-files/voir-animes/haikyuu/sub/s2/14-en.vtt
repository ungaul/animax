WEBVTT

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.520
Akiteru, how long are you able to stay?

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.560
I have to go back to work on the 14th,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.730
so I'm heading back to Sendai the day after tomorrow.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.390
You didn't want to go to Kei's game?

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.640
When I mentioned that I was thinking about going yesterday,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.560
he looked really annoyed...

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.510
Oh, yeah.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.140
Mom, about Kei's glasses... I'm home.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.100
Welcome home.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.480
How was the game?

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.200
Oh. Well, we won.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.120
What were your opponents like?

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.480
Two meters.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.270
Huh?

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.730
They had a first-year that was 201 cm tall.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.130
Two hundred... And you won?

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.460
Apparently, he'd just started playing volleyball.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.840
Seriously?

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.140
Our blocks were absolutely useless, though.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.690
Ah...

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.750
What?

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.860
You think it's only obvious if you lose, don't you?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.280
Huh? Yeah.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.900
I mean, he was two meters tall.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.660
Why don't you come over and join my team's practice?

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.940
Haikyu!!

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.970
Episode 14: "Still Growing"
All right, start your individual practice now.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.000
We now have less than two months until the qualifier

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.880
at the end of October.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.590
Work hard on improving individually.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.440
Yeah!

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.970
K-Kageyama-kun, what are you doing?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.960
You could tell it was me?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.810
Yeah... Damn it!

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.060
Was that supposed to be a disguise?

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.540
Um, uh...

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.820
There's a team that we might face during the qualifier for the prefecture,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.640
and I wanted to check them out before that.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.050
I see. So you were going to shoot a video of them?

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.560
No. There's an unwritten rule that you can only record official matches.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.620
So nothing is actually going to happen by me watching,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.970
but summer vacation's over

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.980
and there's less than two months until the prefectural qualifier.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.490
I felt like I should definitely check them out.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.690
Um...

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.320
If you don't want to stand out at a school after school hours,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.720
I think it's best to just wear plain training gear.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.750
Bus Stop

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.570
And like... That's too funny.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.680
I'm a student here...

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.730
I'm a student here...

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.500
I'm a student here...

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.940
Setter Soul Natural... Be natural.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.020
All right. We're about to start.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.990
Setter Soul We're gonna be switching out members next.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.860
Right!

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.700
Nice serve!

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.250
Hey, can you stop Ushiwaka, Tsukishima?

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.960
Of course not.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.920
Even if it was pure luck, he's the ace of a team in the national Top Three.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.130
Well, if someone doesn't stop Ushiwaka, we won't be able

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.180
to beat Shiratorizawa.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.640
We're middle blockers.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.210
You're already thinking about taking top in the prefecture?

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.840
You're sure taking this lightly.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.980
Anyway,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.470
we have to beat everyone, so it's the same thing.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.560
You piss me off.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.650
Why?!

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.420
If you can't do it,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.120
I'm gonna do it!

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.800
Thinking that you can't do it yourself is one thing,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.790
but having someone else tell you that you can't is irritating.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.580
Huh?

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.840
Especially when it comes from you.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.750
You pushed the diarrhea pressure point! Curse you, Tsukishima!

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.450
I'm leaving.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.220
Hey, this is Kei.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.310
I'm heading over today.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.990
Ow!

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.090
Sorry!

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.370
You made it back alive, Kageyama.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.610
How'd it go?

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.540
I...

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.420
I may never be able to defeat Oikawa-san.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.320
What are you talking about?

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.400
Quit messing around!

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.320
What did you see?

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.750
I think Seijoh was having a match against a college that had some of their alumni.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.170
When I got there, they were on break,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.530
and they were about to start a new match with different members.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.720
I'm Oikawa. Pleasure working with you all.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.720
Oikawa-san went onto the college team as their setter.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.180
It looked like there were a lot of people he had just met.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.810
That's Seijoh's captain, right?

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.930
He's pretty gaudy.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.610
But...

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.680
After just a few plays,

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.460
Oikawa-san was a part of the team.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.900
Even I could tell how lively the spikers felt.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.960
The ability to draw 100% out of anyone...

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.850
Most people can't do that, even after spending lots of time with them.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.970
But with Oikawa-san, it didn't matter if he disliked the player,

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.420
or if the player had certain habits.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.310
I'm sure

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.580
that he could use them freely.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.200
No matter where he is,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.130
Oikawa is a setter that can bring the absolute best out of his team.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.960
So are you saying that you're freaked out

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.740
by the Great King again, Kageyama-kun?

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.020
Yeah, I'm really freaked out.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.270
Right now, Seijoh is what it is

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.960
because it's had Oikawa-san for the last three years,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.260
and our only chance to fight them again is at the Spring Tournament.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.860
We're going to beat them, as a team.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.440
I'm going to defeat you, Great King!

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.440
That's my line!

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.690
Achoo!

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.280
I just got a chill...

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.470
If you catch a cold, I'm going to punch you.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.150
That's going way too far!

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.370
Two blockers!

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.850
All right!

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.460
Adults definitely have much more power...

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.740
What the hell?

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.990
You're such a twig!

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.460
You eating properly?

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.660
Can I go home now?

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.170
Now, now, Akaizawa-san. Just watch.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.360
My little brother will show you a thing or two.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.640
Like I'd lose to this puny little high schooler.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.850
Kaji Wild Dogs

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.840
He loves riling people up.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.770
Forgive him.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.400
Hey, can you stop Ushiwaka, Tsukishima?

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.320
You think it's only obvious if you lose, don't you?

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.570
Maybe that's because you suck.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.890
Tch.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.540
Um...

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.570
Is there a way to stop an opponent's spike

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.640
when they are taller or stronger than you?

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.060
Aoba Johsai Private High School

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.270
Hey!

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.130
Now that you've finally decided to show up, you should at least announce yourself!

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.910
Now, now, now.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.680
Calm down, Yahaba.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.490
Oikawa-san...

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.370
It's been a while. I've been waiting for you.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.980
Welcome back, Mad Dog-chan.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:41.640
Haikyu!!

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.230
Wait, who's this Mad Dog?

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.350
A second-year named Kyotani Kentaro.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.730
Oikawa-san just decided to call him Mad Dog.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.280
He was pretty famous in junior high, remember?

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.280
Oh, yeah. I remember.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.860
Minamisan Junior High was strong just that year.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.960
Izumitate               Minamisan Jr. High

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.420
He was never a team player,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.510
but his abilities were superb for our grade.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.660
As soon as he joined the club,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.340
he had a chance to be in a practice match...

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.920
But he suddenly butted heads with the third-years.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.390
What he said may have been accurate, but the way he said it...

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.850
The toss is too far from the net and hard to hit!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.980
You could have totally followed up on that! You suck!

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.400
His attitude toward the third-years didn't change,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.200
and he eventually stopped showing up.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.030
What the hell?

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.650
There are still third-years around?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.160
I thought all of you would have retired

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.030
after losing in the Inter-High prelims.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.130
You're as funny as always, Mad Dog-chan.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.670
I wish you'd stop calling me that.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.260
"Ah, I'm so happy I got to play

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.100
on the team while Oikawa-san was still here."

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.090
I'll make you feel that way.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.550
His natural instincts are making him cautious around Oikawa-san?

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:17.230
Metropolitan Nekoma High School

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.230
So, with the prefectural qualifier in October,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.700
we'll only be able to go Kanto two more times, including this trip.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.330
Let's make the best of this chance.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.270
Right!

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.760
Hey, Tsukki!

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.300
Jump block for me! Hey, hey, hey!

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.840
Hey!

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.260
This chapter is titles, "Boku Gets Rejected by a Student From Another School."

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.140
Yes. Thanks for working with me.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.780
What?!

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.650
Why are you so surprised when you're the one who asked him?

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.650
Is there a way to stop an opponent's spike

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:03.700
when they are taller or stronger than you?

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.970
What do you think is most important when blocking?

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.130
Height?

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.090
It's timing.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:23.160
To put it simply, if their hands are above the net,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.060
even a grade-schooler could stop one of Tanaka's spikes.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.440
What?!

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.060
Provided their timing is perfect.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.860
Of course, how you have your hands out,

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.240
and reading the course of the ball is important, too.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.330
But even if I can explain this verbally,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.120
I'm not good enough to actually show you.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.300
Someone nearby with good individual skills

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.780
who is a good example when it comes to blocking

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.240
would probably be Kuroo from Nekoma.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.200
Lev!

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.410
Timing...

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.980
Having the top of the block up

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.880
right when your opponent is about to hit their spike.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.920
I-I'm going to make it through next time!

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.100
Hey, Tsukki.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.900
How long are you just gonna watch?

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.600
Sorry.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.040
Pardon the intrusion.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.650
Shinzen                  Karasuno

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.400
It appears that the quick's success rate is still about 70%.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.080
All right!

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.820
Nothing's going to fix that except more practice.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.970
Lev! I told you not to block with your arms spread out!

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.210
They got through your block!

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.080
Your arms need to be together enough so the ball won't go through!

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.190
Right.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.350
Karasuno    Neighborhood Association

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.320
Karasuno General Athletic Park Indoor Gymnasium

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.250
Tokyo Training Camp Qualifier Matches

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.170
Karasuno Nekoma Front! Front!

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.080
Sorry!
Got it!

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.280
Center!

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.180
Hinata!

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.380
Out!

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.770
Karasuno                 Nekoma

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.220
Damn it! Sorry about that!

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.450
At long last, we can't let our guard down around them.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.110
Yeah.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.000
The nights are cold, even in Tokyo.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.740
That's because you didn't put on a jacket after sweating.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.850
I can't wait for the match!

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.670
Yeah...

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.860
I've been thinking lately...

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.590
What?

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.110
You're entertaining, Shoyo,

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:54.170
so I'd like to play a game with you that's not a practice game.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.840
Huh?

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:59.180
A game where it's immediately "game over" if you lose.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.480
Let's do it.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.140
A match where there is no rematch.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.780
This is our last chance for the Battle at the Garbage Dump.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.330
Let's see each other at the Tokyo Gymnasium.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.080
Yeah.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.120
Hey, hey, Tsukki.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.100
You better make sure you beat Ushiwaka.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.580
Why is that?

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.460
Because I've had complete victory over you,

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.920
so if you have complete victory over Ushiwaka,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.600
that means I'll have complete-complete victory over Ushiwaka.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.630
Complete-Complete Victory!!

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.630
I'm sorry. I'm not entirely sure what you mean.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.600
Karasuno Volleyball Club
Then I'll be the best! Hey, hey, hey!

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.530
You make it sound so easy...

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.520
Qualifier Matches

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:45.730
Left!

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.190
Akaizawa-san!

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.620
The receive was off, so the attack can only go left.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.150
The toss is a bit far from the net.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.860
Akaizawa-san is going for the course that he's best at, a cross.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.700
Right as your opponent is about to hit the ball,

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.020
you complete the block.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.860
Yeah!

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.460
Hey! Wrap it up already!

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.930
You're really gonna feel this tomorrow.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.240
What? Already?

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.140
But I don't feel like I've hit enough.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.030
For crying out loud...

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.880
That feeling, that you haven't hit enough...

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.640
Why don't you save that for tomorrow?

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.810
I see!

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.070
Right!

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.550
Kageyama! Let's race to see who can pick up the most balls!

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.670
Bring it on!

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.850
Good job, Yachi-san.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.130
All right, let's take down the net.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.340
Right!

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.250
Qualifier Matches

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.590
We're here!

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.970
Back at the Sendai Municipal Gymnasium again!

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.010
We're gonna get our revenge!

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.270
Don't you dare false start, you dumbass!

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:14.560
It's like Hinata and Kageyama live on spinal reflex alone.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.560
They're like insects.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.200
Johzenji High School Huh?

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.200
That means...

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.410
Glasses-chan! Be sure to tell me your number today!

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.760
She's so cute when she gets shy.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:34.420
Hey!

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.050
Stop it!

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.260
Ugh... I'm so sorry about that!

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.360
Hey, they stopped.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.730
They're stopped in mid-air. That's awesome.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.900
Well, see you in the first match.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.360
So they're... Johzenji Karasuno

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.920
The team that was at the Inter-High semifinal.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.980
This goes without saying, but...

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.230
They're all here.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.020
Right here.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.760
We're gonna beat them all!

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.690
They're so hyper.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.600
That just calms us down even more.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.190
I'm well aware...

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.160
That the bathroom is where you run into dangerous people.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.380
Carefully... Carefully...

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.240
Whatcha doin'?

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.750
Th-The Great King and Seijoh's ace!

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.800
I heard you defeated the 2 meter guy. Well done.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.160
Yes! No!

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.970
Which is it?

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:07.150
This little shrimp is a handful during matches,

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.320
so why don't we go bury him somewhere now?

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.660
P-Pardon me!

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.410
Hey!
Ow!

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.820
Hinata Shoyo...

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.080
And Oikawa and Iwaizumi.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.470
What's with this timing?

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:26.280
Hell if I know.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.520
So this will be your last tournament in high school.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.500
I wish you well.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.770
You seriously piss me off.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.710
We're going to nationals, so it's not going to be our last.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.010
Only one team from the qualifiers can go to nationals.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.530
The fact that he's not saying that just to be mean

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.390
is even more infuriating.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.970
What's going on?

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.290
Whoa! It's Shiratorizawa and Seijoh.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.780
Did we just walk in on a tense situation?

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.350
Who's the guy in the middle?

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.440
It's that one guy!

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.420
From the team that beat the two-meter guy, Karasuno!

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.800
It's the #10 from Karasuno!

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.160
Is he trying to pick a fight with Seijoh and Shiratorizawa?

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.320
Holy crap!

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.240
A-Anyway, Karasuno's going to win... Eek!

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.700
U-Um... Date Tech

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.330
I-I'm so sorry!

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.390
It doesn't matter who it is.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.700
We'll gladly accept your challenge.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.470
O-Oh, hi.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:32.890
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Date Tech!

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.270
Rule the Court
Push it, push it, push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.650
With Intense Force Shiratorizawa Academy

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.580
Shiratorizawa!

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.860
Go, go, let's go! Let's go, Date Tech!
The Iron Wall of Date

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.070
The first match has Seijoh on the B Court,

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.630
and Shiratorizawa on the A Court.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.080
Karasuno Johzenji We're up next!

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:54.870
Let's go!

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.660
Yeah!

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.960
All right...

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.760
We're gonna play more than anyone else here!

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.220
Yahoo!

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.600
Wha?

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.140
There they are, the party team.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.100
Johzenji!

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.320
Curse that playboy from Johzenji!

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.800
We're gonna have to switch to 24-hour surveillance.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.910
We'll protect Kiyoko-san, even if it means our lives!

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.580
Tanaka and Nishinoya are saying something again...

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.160
Episode 15: "Place to Play"
Next time on Haikyu!!: "Place to Play."
