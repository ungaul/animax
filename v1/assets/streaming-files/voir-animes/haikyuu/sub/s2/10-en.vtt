WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.730
Mongolia Pub

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.610
But, wow... To think we played over sixty sets and only won three...

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.500
Manabu! Come on, drink up.
We've definitely gone down a thorny path.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.950
No, thanks. If I drink any more, I'll definitely feel it tomorrow.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.950
That's for sure.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.660
Well, if they were like they were during the Seijoh match,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.910
they could have probably won a few more.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.320
Manabu, are you saying you're too good for my liquor?
The team's offense was styled around Hinata and Kageyama's

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.380
weirdo quick and their bait routine, and they executed them well.
No, um... I'm just kidding!

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.840
But we could see the limits of that strategy.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.840
The truth is that they lost to Seijoh,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.660
and that's why they started changing things up.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.310
I know.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.020
They're all developing their own cogs.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.100
There's no way they could beat

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.270
the powerhouse schools of Kanto while they're still incomplete.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.320
But... Once all the cogs fit together...

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.480
Hey! Don't think that you can beat Nekoma that easily.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.870
I certainly didn't mean to say that it would be easy!

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.160
But we'll still do our absolute and win.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.060
You sure talk big now, Sensei.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.310
You, too, Ukai-chan.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.800
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.020
This is the final set...

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.220
of our losing streak at these away games.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.700
Let's at least try to win this one set against

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.680
the strongest school at the training camp, Fukurodani,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.430
before we go home.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.930
Yeah!

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.820
I'll show you my progress

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.500
from the training camp!

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.380
Haikyu!!

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.330
Episode 10: "Cogs"

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.790
Karasuno Fukurodani Let's play!

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.610
We're gonna get this one!

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.760
Yeah!

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.220
All right! Bring it, Karasuno!

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.510
Asahi-san, nice serve!

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.230
It's a bit off!

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.670
Bokuto-san!
Right!

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.670
Left, #4!

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.120
Tighten up for the straight.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.150
If there's even the slightest gap, it'll get through.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.860
Out!

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.910
A wipe, huh... So close!

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.230
Don't worry about it, Tsukishima! You were close!
You guys keep getting better every day, and it's annoying.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.900
Right.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.000
Karasuno Fukurodani Left, left!

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.680
Whoa, he got it!

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.590
But it's off!

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.500
A quick from there?!

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.560
Even if the receive is a little off,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.390
they confidently pull off a quick.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.350
Their setter's pretty skilled, as well.
Nice serve.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.490
Break it off after the first one!

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.260
Their #4 is up front now.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.770
Now I can finally hit up front.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.290
Nice serve!

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.520
Nishinoya!

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.950
Nice receive!

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.820
Nice, monkey!

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.160
Give me the last one!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.950
Right now, our front row is in the rotation where the wall is at its highest.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.160
Make sure you stop the ball!

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.060
That's an insane cut shot...

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.040
Hitting at a sharp angle against three blockers is really tricky.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.840
It can be hard on your shoulders if they're not flexible, too.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.220
All right!

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.960
Did you see that, Akaashi?

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.260
Hey, did you see my awesome cut shot right now?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.580
I did. Amazing.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.570
It was pure luck, though!

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.070
Bokuto is so annoying.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.910
That's amazing, even if it was luck.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.110
I'd love to hit something like that.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.330
Fukurodani's Bokuto-kun is a real puzzle.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.260
Hey, can I try hitting that again?

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.560
Even when he's your opponent, you kind of want to cheer for him.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.220
I wanna do it again!

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.270
The other team's completely on to you, Bokuto-san.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.760
Though that might be because I think he's a player on a completely different level.
Oh, crap! My bad.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.420
Then maybe I'll go for a straight.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.110
True...

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.610
He might just be a player

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.000
who lifts the spirits of both his teammates and his opponents.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.300
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.220
Yeah!

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.480
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.260
A special attack?!

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.890
Yup!

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.830
Listen up. The best way to describe this attack

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.860
is something born from upsetting the balance of stillness and motion.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.430
Whoa! Whoa...

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.490
There he goes, trying to sound cool again.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.750
Do you have any idea what he's talking about?

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.070
I have an idea.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.780
This isn't a move that you use to run away.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.550
You have to have the perfect timing, the perfect toss,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.610
and look like you're about to hit the perfect spike.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.340
When everyone thinks you're about to hit a powerful spike...

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.770
More than anything, it works best

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.900
when you think you're about to hit a powerful one yourself.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.730
Leave it to me!

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.460
Nice receive!

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.180
Just like you're sneering...

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.910
Let them have it!

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.600
Ah!

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.980
Hinata just...

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.440
...did a feint?!

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.580
When you get a feint in,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.840
there's a completely different sense of satisfaction than you get from a good spike.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.980
You know how a handful of receivers will dive for the falling ball?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.730
Yeah.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.590
You're usually eye level with them or above,

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.140
but the moment they try to reach for the ball, miss, then look up...

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.300
It's the best feeling.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.580
A feint?!

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.560
You're the one who taught it to him.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.820
You actually used your head?

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.260
You're gonna get a fever.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.450
You are the only person who doesn't get to say stuff like that to me.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.320
Hmph! I'm not gonna let them get any more points.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.510
I don't think that's going to be possible.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.720
Akaashi, back me up once in a while!

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.660
Damn that little Shrimpy!

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.840
We're not gonna lose!

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.340
Karasuno Fukurodani #2! #2!

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.840
All right!

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.800
Ready and...

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.270
They all seem to be enjoying themselves.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.060
One touch!
Got it!

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.510
I wonder if it's because of Bokuto-kun's influence.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.130
All right!
Wow, a dump!

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.250
Kageyama-kun's doing very well.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.050
He hasn't missed a jump serve today, either.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.610
Yeah, Kageyama today is like...

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.050
Calm and collected.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.280
He gives you the same uneasy feeling as the calm before a storm.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.950
One more, Tsukishima! Nice serve!

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.700
I feel like everything I ate this morning is gone from my stomach,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.960
but I'm still not hungry.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.240
My body's more responsive than usual,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.960
and I can see everyone moving around me.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.720
I can tell how well I'm doing, too.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.160
All right!

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.310
The same goes for everyone else.
Nice, Daichi-san!

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.680
Is this because of the barbecue?

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.350
Hinata's doing well, too.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.770
He's not making any unnecessary movements.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.480
We just might...

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.740
...be able to do the new quick.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.240
But...

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.870
Asahi-san, nice receive!

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.780
Is he planning on doing the new quick?

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.710
But if we miss, the good atmosphere surrounding the team might shatter.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.720
We should just hold off on the new quick

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.630
until the chance of success is higher...

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.940
You're not gonna do it?

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.070
The ball's coming...

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.060
And...

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.190
It stops.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.050
You've got to be kidding me!

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.560
If you're gonna do that, let me know sooner!

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.870
I just felt like we could pull it off! Didn't you?!

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.430
What the heck? Is the weirdo quick making a comeback?
I did, but it was too sudden!

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.560
Not quite.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.400
I've got to mentally prepare, and stuff!

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.100
That was... different from the quick they were doing in the beginning.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.880
Who cares?! We actually did it!

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:48.560
The first...

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.860
...cog.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:10:03.370
Haikyu!!

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.040
The ball's coming...

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:11.960
And...

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.750
It stops.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.550
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.970
All right!

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.080
All right!
What the heck was that?!

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.990
That was awesome!

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.810
Nice, Hinata, Kageyama!

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.010
Hey, Akaashi. Was that really that amazing?

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.780
Could we do it, too?

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.780
That's something we should never try.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.990
Hinata hit it like it was nothing,

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.660
but I believe it would take a lot of practice to hit a toss like that.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.750
Not to mention...

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.720
Making a toss float at the point of impact is an incredible move.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.960
At my skill level, that's impossible.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.820
You're not gonna do it?

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.920
He encouraged me again, damn it.
What? You wanna start somethin'?

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.760
But that was awesome! So cool!

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.110
It stopped right before my eyes!

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.450
It was like shoop!

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.680
I totally thought it was coming this time,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.890
but when it actually stops right in front of you, it's sorta scary!

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.580
You really are awesome!

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.570
Wh-What... You dumbass... Awesome! So awesome!

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.320
Kageyama's expression right now is indescribable.
You're so awesome, Kageyama!

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.600
What happened to his mimetic muscles?

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.910
It's not often that Hinata compliments Kageyama

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.540
in such a straightforward way.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.160
I'm glad we actually believed in this and waited.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.790
Yeah.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.750
Anyway, next time, make sure you—

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.710
You did it! You did it!

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.420
Nice kill, Hinata! Kageyama-kun!

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.170
Finally, after three weeks...

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.760
Ever since that fight,

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.140
Hinata and Kageyama-kun stopped talking to each other.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.180
But both of them worked hard on improving.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.310
And, now...

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.520
The weirdo duo is back in action!

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.530
One more time!

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.360
I'm so jealous!

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.860
Let me look cool, too!

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.060
We can't let them beat us.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.120
Let's keep up!

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.230
Hey, hey, hey!

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.210
Don't get cocky, you guys!

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.340
Hey, hey, hey!
All right!

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.560
All right!
Shoyo...

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.770
...always does something new.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.560
Maybe if Shrimpy came to our team,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.760
you'd feel a bit more motivated.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.970
I wouldn't be able to be on the same team as Shoyo.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.230
Huh? Why?

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.520
If I'm not able to keep doing new things,

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.660
I wouldn't be able to keep up with Shoyo.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.120
No matter how well I were to play hookie,

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.270
Shoyo would probably find me out.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.360
Even that genius first-year setter

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.430
hesitated for just a second and Shoyo figured it out.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.320
That'd be exhausting.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.990
Huh...

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.240
Then maybe Shrimpy should just stay as our opponent

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.560
and practice partner, and then you'd feel a bit more motivated.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.460
Why?

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.700
Because whenever you watch Shrimpy play,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.750
you have the same expression on your face as when you're about

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.330
to play a new game you just bought.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.640
No, I don't.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.270
And what does that face look like, anyway?

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.450
Really excited.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.450
What does that mean? I don't know what you're talking about.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.300
I don't make that face.
You do.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.220
I do not.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.730
You do.
I do not.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.000
U-Um, Ukai-kun... Hm?

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.420
To be honest, at first glance,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.810
I can't tell the difference between this and their previous weirdo quick.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.370
Ah...

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.600
In the previous quick,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.530
the toss would go right through Hinata's point of impact.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.480
Point of Impact Conversely, with this new quick,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.030
they're trying to make it so that the spiker's highest point of impact

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.590
equals the ball's point of arrival.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.500
Once the ball's forward momentum reaches zero,

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.220
there's a brief moment that you wouldn't have

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.180
if the ball was going straight through.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.010
The difference is ultimately that one moment.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.680
It means that Hinata has more options while he's in the air.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.650
Oh!

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.290
I need to make sure

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.480
I bring that geezer to the spring tournament.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.780
I'm gonna show him their quick in person.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.290
Nice receive!

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.000
Kill the ball's momentum... Kill it...

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.340
Damn it! I'm visualizing the same thing as last time, too!

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.300
All right!

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.440
Oh, my.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.990
Lucky! Lucky!

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.310
Did he lose his incredible concentration from earlier?

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.560
Don't worry about it, Kageyama-kun!

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.220
Damn it! That pisses me off!

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.640
Why?! What else am I supposed to say?!

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.780
Well, this isn't something that happens easily.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.490
And what better time... ...for the senpais to shine!

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.450
Karasuno Fukurodani One blocker!

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.510
One touch!

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.370
Got it!

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.760
There's that weird sound!

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.920
But a double hit wasn't called!

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.050
From the libero's toss...

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.550
It's the ace's...

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.510
...back row attack!

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.930
The second...

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.660
...cog!

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.820
It's an out?! So close!

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.370
Sorry, my toss was a bit low. Damn it!

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.970
I-It was fine!

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.710
I actually think it was my mistake.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.210
You need to be honest when I mess up, Asahi-san!

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.540
Oh, okay...

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.400
I-I'd appreciate it if you could toss the ball up a bit higher.
They changed this much in a week?

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.180
I know that!
That's terrifying.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.810
That's it! Keep it up!

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.300
We still don't have enough experience

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.060
to be able to go head-to-head with a powerhouse school

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.800
while they're on guard.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.910
Got it!

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:57.760
Left! Left!

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.360
Karasuno Fukurodani Two blockers!

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.230
Our team might not be good at winning right now,

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.230
Chance ball!

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.700
Got it!

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.710
but we'll focus on honing our new weapons.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:08.920
Now!

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.950
Spikers from all directions head up about the same time...

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.910
A synchronized attack on first tempo!

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.370
Don't let the blockers pinpoint the target!

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.320
All of you, jump up and strike like the toss is going up for you!

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.220
All right!

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.800
It feels so awesome when a spike goes through...

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.750
He's crying... All right!

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.200
He's babbling...

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.690
Well, it's been so long since I made a spike this awesome.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.900
Damn it! Where do you guys get off using a synchro attack like that?

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.680
Kageyama, nice toss!

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.780
Thank you!

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.300
Tanaka-kun, nice kill!

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.290
Thanks!

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.450
Always something new, huh?

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.120
Don't look the other way!

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.370
The third...

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.780
...cog!

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.860
That was a synchronized attack on first tempo...

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.320
It went through so smoothly!

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:08.840
Yeah.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.920
Against their three blockers,

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.420
our attack, including the back row attack, had four players advancing at once.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.010
They weren't able to mark all of them.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.020
Is something wrong?

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.640
No...

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.850
There's just something I want to try out now.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.410
Damn it!

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.370
All right!

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.860
Karasuno's at the top of their game.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.590
The messy attacks they were trying on the first day are finally succeeding.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.300
All right!

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.010
Karasuno Fukurodani Yes, yes, yes!

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.820
We're actually neck-and-neck

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.530
with Fukurodani at the last part of the game.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.220
Yeah!

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.350
That doesn't mean you should get too confident.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.680
The real battle begins now.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.680
Right!

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.120
It's true that we should be on our guard,

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.980
but it's also true that all of the cogs you have created

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.820
are now starting to fit together.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.060
Please continue to perfect them

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.220
while you're playing this match.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.490
Right!

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.110
Also, just as planned,

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.490
you haven't been letting their ace spike too freely.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.400
Though there was that one ridiculous cut shot...

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.080
But that was because Tsukishima was able to put in one touch.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.380
Oh, right.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.800
If you can keep their #4 back, we just might be able to do this.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.590
Let's finish this!

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.190
Right!

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.800
We're having a difficult time, but let's stay calm.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.160
We can't Karasuno's attacks faze us.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:46.730
Yeah!
Right.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.180
Bokuto-san? Were you listening?

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.440
Wha? Yeah, I was listening.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.500
Come on, let's do this already.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.060
Could that mean...

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.660
Karasuno Fukurodani All right!

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.730
Damn it! I'm sorry!

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.600
It was our chance to turn things around...

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.010
Don't worry about it!

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.250
Nice try, Noya-san!

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.380
All right! I'm gonna blow them away with my serve.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.850
Bokuto, nice serve!

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.610
Bokuto-san, stay calm.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.220
I am calm!

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.290
This isn't good. He's losing his temper.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.980
All right! Here I go!

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.760
Damn it! I'm sorry!

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.130
Calm down.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.980
Don't worry about it... I'm sorry!

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:46.620
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.150
Hey, Karasuno caught up with them again.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.170
Yeah...

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.620
Are they actually going to turn the tables at the last minute?

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.550
Their #4 can hit from anywhere.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.360
We're gonna use our serves and try to keep him in check.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.330
Right.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.250
Crap! I aimed too far for the corner.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.670
You jerk!

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.380
Whoa... It barely made it in. Lucky!

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.300
Give it to me!

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.300
I'll finish this in one hit!

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.100
Seconds There are few possibilities

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.370
when giving a toss to Bokuto-san while he's a bit angry.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:30.430
Seconds

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.020
A: If he scores normally, there will be no problems.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.490
All right!

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.920
B: If he misses, or he's blocked again,

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.150
he may start to feel even worse.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.410
C: If I don't give him a pass...

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.930
Hmph! I don't care anymore!

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.630
he may become uncooperative.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.040
C is the most annoying.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:31.790
Bokuto-san!

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.470
Three blockers!

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.810
All right!

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.450
Got it!

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.170
One more time, Akaashi!

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.930
Here.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.260
All right!

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.570
This time, we're gonna stop it!

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:45.550
Ready, and...

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.430
Ah... Gah.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.540
All right!

00:20:53.850 --> 00:21:01.070
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.840
Wow, Karasuno turned it around!

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.330
Isn't this the first time this week Karasuno has taken the lead?

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.070
It could be.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.330
W-Was that a block?

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.810
No... It didn't seem to make it over the net,

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.450
so it was a spike miss.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.670
Oh, could this mean...

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.650
Aw, man... Is this happening now?

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.010
Seriously? Isn't it a bit early?

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.630
Wow, already?

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:25.170
It's early...

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.800
Jeez, here it comes... Akaashi...

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.400
Don't toss to me anymore!

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.060
There it is! Bokuto's emo mode!

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:38.560
What the...

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.200
All right.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.250
Huh?

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.250
Then please calm down in the time that I'm not tossing to you.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.440
Does this mean our chance has arrived?

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.580
Yeah! We can win this match!

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.200
I don't know what's going on,

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.040
but their ace doesn't seem to be doing well.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.230
Let's keep it up!

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.420
Yeah!

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.880
Hinata, we're gonna use that quick again.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.760
I'll give you the toss that you want.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:06.430
Trust me, and jump.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.220
Yeah!

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.550
We're going to take our new weapons

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.160
and defeat Fukurodani!

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.530
We might finally be able to beat Fukurodani!

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.320
Their ace even said not to toss to him anymore.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.610
I wonder if we'll be able to eat more meat if we win.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.080
But does that mean we won't be able to eat any if we lose?

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.000
We're gonna win no matter what!

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.540
