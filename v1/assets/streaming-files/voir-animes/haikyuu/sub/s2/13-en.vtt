WEBVTT

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.860
Hyakuzawa, nice kill!

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.480
Hyakuzawa, nice kill!

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.070
Whoa, that angle's insane!

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.020
Nice kill!

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.790
Let's play!

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.790
He looks so intense up close.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.500
You look like you're doing well again today, Hyakuzawa-kun, so we're set.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.160
Oh, right.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.510
By the looks of it, no one over there matches your height.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.760
Oh, right.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.450
If you get confused about the rules again, make sure you ask.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.470
I think I've got the rules by now.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.180
You can see how their #3 and #9 serve,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.480
so let's keep the ball in the air and cover our positions.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.060
This team was able to give Seijoh a hard time,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.990
but that doesn't matter.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.410
We will just fight, taking advantage of our strength.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.550
Let's go!

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.870
Kakugawa          Karasuno Yeah!

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.170
If we win this match, we get through the prelims.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.130
Who the hell cares if they've got a guy that's two meters tall?

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.010
We're gonna win no matter what!

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.360
Haikyu!!

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.520
Episode 13: "A Simple and Pure Strength"

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.320
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.770
Musshi!
Got it!

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.110
Hyakuzawa!

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.400
A daring, straight, head-to-head competition!

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.790
Hopefully the ace's first shot will set the mood.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.070
Three blockers!

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.270
Although, it's not like it matters.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.580
From above?

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.200
All right!

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.370
He hit that from above the block...
Hyakuzawa, nice kill!

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.790
Seriously?

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.930
There's no point in even blocking then.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.770
Kakugawa Karasuno Coming in from the left!

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.890
Hyakuzawa!

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.230
Sorry, cover!

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.440
Hinata, get the last!

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.960
If I hit it, it'll get caught...

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.070
A dink?

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.440
All right!

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.720
What incredible height...

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.920
Normally, that would have been able to go above the block.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.520
One more!
But he's sort of ridiculous... Right.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.920
Listen carefully, Hyakuzawa.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.040
Sorry! The ball was a little low.
No matter how weird that #10's movements might be,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.090
Don't worry about it.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.860
when you're blocking, just follow the ball.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.130
Next! Next!

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.860
All right, let's get one.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.390
Right.
Yes!

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.990
There're even more people now.
See? That's the two meters guy.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.030
Wow, you weren't kidding.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.820
Wow, he's big.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.310
Oh, Mikako-sensei.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.900
Oh? Hello, Onoya-san!

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.830
This is my neighbor.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.780
Mikako-sensei is the adviser for a junior high volleyball club.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.560
One of the players on the opposing team is really tall.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.500
Everyone on my team is so small,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.960
so I can't help but cheer for the smaller team.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.200
No need to worry.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.860
That big guy's got nothing on Karasuno's #10.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.350
Right, Ukai-sensei?

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.320
It's true that he's got a disadvantage.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.390
Like with height and speed.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.180
Once a simple and pure strength grows past a certain level,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.480
it becomes something that overwhelms an ordinary person.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.780
In head-to-head competition, at least.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.080
What the heck?

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.740
Why are you moving your fingers like a pervy old man?

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.440
I'm not imagining it...

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.030
The ball seems to fit in my hands better.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.630
Kakugawa          Karasuno

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.180
Up! Above the net.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.550
Push it in, Hinata!

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.980
It's impossible.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.510
There's no way that Hyakuzawa would lose in a pushing match above the net.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.140
All right!

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.260
Out!

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.170
Hey, Karasuno finally got a point.
All right!

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.780
Only because the other team messed up.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.750
I've never heard of Kakugawa,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.440
but they're making a name for themselves.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.230
Only because of their guy that's two meters tall.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.700
It's basically a one-man show.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.210
Crap! Did he hear us?

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.030
We already know that.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.630
Like we care.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.630
What?!

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.670
Come on. #9 is serving.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.230
We're gonna get one.
Kageyama, nice serve!

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.600
It's off!

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.300
Got it!

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.400
As long as we can get the receive up, everything becomes a chance ball.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.770
All right!

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.480
I see... We're gonna have to do something about that.
Nice kill, Hyakuzawa!

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.010
Oh, right.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.820
But...

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.200
Sensei.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.620
Right.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.630
A time out, huh?
All right!

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.350
Looks like Karasuno doesn't stand a chance.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.550
Th-That's not true!

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.460
You're on a roll!

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.080
This is your first official match and you're doing awesome!

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.890
Oh, right.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.050
Don't worry.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.770
Just like other teams have aces, we have Hyakuzawa.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.440
The more Hyakuzawa scores, the better we're supporting him.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.540
Even if it doesn't seem like we're doing much.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.080
We just have to look smug at the fact that Hyakuzawa's on our team.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.650
Indeed.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.320
We just have to do our best to ensure

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.050
that Hyakuzawa performs his best.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.470
Even if they call us a one-man show,

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.790
that is our winning style.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.590
What's wrong?

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.680
Their #10...

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.000
I sort of feel bad when he's so small and trying his best to jump.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.760
Hey, are you trying to be mean?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.800
Not really.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.690
Well, it's true that

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.020
Hyakuzawa will be too tall for him, even though he's only played volleyball for six months.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.420
It sucks for him.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.050
Passing in volleyball is hard...

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.230
but it's...

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.630
Simple.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.700
No matter how high I jump, he keeps hitting from above me.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.660
What do I do?

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.770
Well, calm down.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.410
Shoyo,

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.080
volleyball isn't just about mid-air battles.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.640
Huh?

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.000
I've noticed something.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.010
Kakugawa Karasuno Left, left!

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.090
Hyakuzawa!

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.820
Here he comes!

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.920
After watching their previous warm up, and how they play,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.540
it appears that Kakugawa's #9 can't hit the ball any way he wants.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.960
He can only hit in a cross direction that his body is facing.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.070
Judging from their practice,

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.360
it seems that their #9 only recently started volleyball.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.760
So, like Lev from Nekoma?

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.240
However, he lacks the speed and senses that Lev has.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.200
If you put it another way, Kakugawa's #9 only has his height,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.250
but that alone is far beyond everyone else.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.210
So when that #9 is going to hit, let's abandon straights.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.470
All right!

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.990
It's the thing where he jumps diagonally!

00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.560
Go!

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:06.990
All right!

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.900
He somehow managed to get it by.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.110
Kakugawa Karasuno That's amazing, Karasuno!

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.620
They managed to successfully deal with that two-meter guy's attack.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.320
It all depends on how they're going to attack next.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.110
Tanaka, your serve.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.400
Right.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.080
I'm...

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.250
feeling good today.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.260
What?

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.240
Sawamura-san.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.150
Yeah?

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.930
I'm feeling good today, so can we try the new quick?

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.420
Excited Excited Excited Nervous Nervous Nervous

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.400
Calm down, Hinata.
Huh? He's really sparkly.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.800
He looks just like my dog when it's really hungry.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.860
Minamida!

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.730
Got it!

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:48.980
Hyakuzawa!

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.650
All right!

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.990
No matter how weird that #10's movements might be,

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.040
when you're blocking, just follow the ball.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.990
Just follow the ball...

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.460
There it is! Their super quick!

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.780
It's actually a bit different from that, you know.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.430
Yacchi, your face is all weird.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.480
Yahoo! That little #10 is amazing!

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.890
He's probably the tallest player in the prelims at 201 cm,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.100
but the one who'll toying with him the most

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.590
might be only 162 cm tall.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:48.580
Haikyu!!

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.990
Passing in volleyball is hard...

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.640
but it's...

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.170
Simple.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.010
How?!

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.380
I'm 201 cm, and he's only 162 cm!

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.600
Why is he above me right now?

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.700
All right!

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.750
Kakugawa Karasuno Another quick from that #10.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.730
How many is that now?

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.150
Hell yeah!

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.000
Are we at the top of our game?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.190
Are we at the top of our game, Kageyama-kun?!

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.190
Shut up, you guys.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.010
As long as we can get our quicks in, S-Sorry.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.130
we're back to being Karasuno.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.410
Not exactly, Sensei.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.120
You're thinking of the old Karasuno.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.020
Hinata, relax!

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.160
He's in that corner.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.670
Sugawara-san said it was so I couldn't aim with my serve.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.670
Well, it's not like I can do that anyhow!

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.010
It's not unusual for spikers to concentrate just on attacks,

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.960
but for Kakugawa's #9,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.220
it appears that the rest of the team is protecting him.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.030
I feel at ease when their #9 is on the back line.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.030
Nice receive!

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.400
We can't let our guard down, Sensei.
Two blockers!

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:56.610
Ack!

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.570
It appears you're right.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.530
It's coming back! Hit it directly!

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.880
Rather than practicing how to defend or figuring out how to hit,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.540
I'm sure that #9 just practiced hitting the high balls as hard as possible.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.540
Go, Makado!

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.960
Even then, while their #9's in the back,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.000
when we have mid-air battles at the net,

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.350
we have the upper hand.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.300
#10! #10!

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.930
All right!

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.640
Kakugawa Karasuno Set point!

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.600
Yeah, we got it.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.160
Just one more point!

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.040
Get it in one shot!

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.060
Sensei!

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.140
Is Sho-chan's quick also first tempo?

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.660
Do you remember your tempos?

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.280
Yep!

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.580
Nice receive!

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.480
Doing a slow running approach

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.080
to match a high toss and then spiking the ball

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.920
is third tempo.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.500
Kakugawa Karasuno All right!

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.760
Nice, Hyakuzawa!

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.970
Doing a running approach at the same time the toss goes up and then spiking

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.430
is second tempo.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.560
All right!

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.690
Nice, Musshi!

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.000
When the spiker first does a running approach

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.860
and then matches up with the toss

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.320
is first tempo.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.960
Nishinoya, nice serve!

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.000
When you say you're going to defeat a block,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.910
it means you're going to hit the ball from a higher point than the block.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.690
Shrimpy versus two meters.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.750
The one who gets to the top first, wins.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.090
Shrimpy's quick actually isn't a first tempo.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.560
By the time the setter is about to set the ball,

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.010
he's already done his running approach and has already jumped.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.020
It's a minus tempo.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.780
Kakugawa Karasuno All right!

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.990
Minus tempo!

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.880
Don't go trying to copy him, either.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.580
Huh? Why not?

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.530
The only people ridiculous enough to pull that off

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.900
are that duo, with their quick.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:23.370
Hey, you asked me if I was actually scared before the match...

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.170
Was that because you knew the quick would go well today?

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.180
No. Well, I knew I was doing better than normal.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.140
Then why did you say that?

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.350
Well, I mean, you trained plenty hard in Tokyo, right?

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.370
Things other than the quick.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.280
Though your first feint quickly got denied.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.530
Shut up!

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.270
Rather than running around trying to match their #10,

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.040
let's focus on stopping the others.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.860
Yeah.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.560
It's true that Karasuno's #10 can't be stopped by our blockers,

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.790
but the same goes for Hyakuzawa.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.370
We'll try to score more.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.120
Nice receive!
Here comes #10!

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.090
Cover!

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:09.300
Hyakuzawa!

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.140
All right!

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.600
Damn it.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.060
Don't worry about it!

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.880
They got a point, so we'll get two.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.000
Right.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.560
That's exactly why we upped our arsenal.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.340
Sensei.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.000
If I were to go up against a player that big,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.060
would I have to do attacks like Sho-chan and the others to win?

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.010
No way.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.860
If you can't win alone, Nice receive!

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.870
you just have to add a few more.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.830
Hey, four of them started moving at once!

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.040
It's a synchronized attack at first tempo.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.490
All right!

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.720
Their #10 is plenty troublesome on his own...
Nice, Tanaka!

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.240
I'll get that back!

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.060
That's all I can do.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.820
Kakugawa's #9

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.770
should be getting pretty tired,

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.030
but he keeps getting more intense.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.680
Front! Front!

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.380
Nice receive!

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.580
It's true that I have basically no experience, but...

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:24.580
Hyakuzawa!

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.920
I can score points!

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.430
Sorry, it went too high!
Technique doesn't matter.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.120
Hyakuzawa, it's direct!
Steal it!

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.760
Smash it into the ground!

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.720
All right!

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.540
Karasuno          Kakugawa Yeah!

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.800
Tanaka, nice kill!

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.310
Match point!

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.300
Right now in Karasuno's rotation, the blockers are short,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.980
so it's Kakugawa's opportunity to catch up.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:54.700
Even average height looks tiny next to two meters...

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.040
I feel like that's what people are saying.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.040
What?!

00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.900
They heard us?
No way!

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.890
Listen up.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.640
If you can't stop it, then just receive it.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:11.760
It's up!

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.330
Hyakuzawa! We're counting on you.

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.390
Not yet! Hold it for a bit.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.350
If a wall doesn't work,

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:22.900
we'll use a plate.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.730
A soft block!

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:28.540
Asahi-san, nice!

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.090
Nice, Tanaka!

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.610
If it's not a quick,

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.150
I win!

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.580
Spiking doesn't just involve slamming the ball into the ground.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.520
Karasuno Kakugawa All right!

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.300
We did it! We won even without a fujikujira!

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.490
All right!

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.480
Fujikujira?

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.560
A wipe?

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.690
Was that by chance,

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.550
or was it planned?

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.540
I got a point with something other than a quick.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.060
Good job, Hinata!

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.080
We made it through the prelims!

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.360
Inagaki-san.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.130
Line up, Hinata!

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.250
What I said about volleyball being simple... Oh, right.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.500
I take that back.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.430
Kakugawa's two meters...

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.160
is going to be really scary next year.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.810
Kiyoko-san! We'll hold your things!

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.350
They already got most of it.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.270
All right. Let's go.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.880
Oh, I'm going to see if anything got left behind.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.530
You go ahead, Hitoka-chan.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:02.280
Right!

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.250
Jeez. Even if your attacks are getting better, your receives are still crap.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.850
What the hell was that "ack"?

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.760
W-Well, it went up, didn't it?!

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.460
Ack!

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.010
By the way, you guys got your summer break homework done, didn't you?

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.090
Ack!

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.100
You remember me saying that I wouldn't help you, right?

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.890
Ack... Ack... Ennoshita-san's so strong.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.090
Is something wrong, Hinata?

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:35.110
Now we're finally on the same level as the Great King and Ushiwaka Japan.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.070
Huh?!

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.860
I forgot my lunch box!

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.070
Come on, just your number!

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.780
Sorry...

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.610
Whoa, she's getting hit on!
Sorry, I have people waiting for me.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.400
Not to mention, they're scary looking!
It only takes a second to give me your number.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.380
And Tanaka-san and Noya-san already left!

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.200
I'm sorry.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.790
Well, I'll just get it from your phone real quick.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.090
Whoa!

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.470
Sorry! That's my lunch box!

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.220
Let's go! Hurry!
Wait up!

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.710
We were still talking.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:12.720
Hinata!

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.440
Do you have a smartphone? Or an older one?

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.860
Excuse me!

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.050
What the hell's with that jump?

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.780
Karasuno Karasuno...

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.200
Sh-Shimizu-senpai is our precious manager,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.240
so um... um... Huh...

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.640
So you guys beat the two-meter guy.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.960
Huh? Well, yeah...

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.560
Aw... And I was looking forward to playing against the two-meter guy.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.420
Play?

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.630
Matches are super fun, aren't they?

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.600
Um... Did you get through the prelims?

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.410
Prelims? We didn't play in the prelims.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.960
Huh? So you guys were in the Inter-High quarterfinals?

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.110
Ah, I think it was the semifinals.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:00.650
S-Semifinals?!

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.320
See ya.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.890
If we manage to bump into each other at the qualifier,

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.200
let's have some fun and play.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.290
Have some fun and play...

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.760
Ah. A-Apparently he doesn't need your number anymore.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.840
Good.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:21.000
Looks like you got his attention, Hinata.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.540
Sorry about that, and thank you.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.960
Here. You forgot this.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.190
This lunch box wrap is cute.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.090
This is Natsu's... My little sister's!

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.400
Not at all mine!

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.680
Isn't Kiyoko-san a bit late?

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.570
Shall we go check?

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.580
The hell are you looking...

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.350
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.590
You're late, dumbass!

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.540
Kiyoko-san, thank goodness you're safe!

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.930
Did you find anything left behind?

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.370
A cute lunch box wrap—

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.280
You don't have to tell them!

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.440
Someone tried to hit on Kiyoko-san?!

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.070

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.040
We'll just have to take turns going to the bathroom.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:53.610
Yeah!

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.780

Next time on Haikyu!!: "Still Growing."
