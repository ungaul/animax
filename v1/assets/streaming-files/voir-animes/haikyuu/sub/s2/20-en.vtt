WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.190
Be sure you make yourself heard!

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.290
Right!

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.650
Right... Yeah!

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.470
Hm... Karasuno definitely seems different.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.620
Sorry!

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.700
Oh?

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.320
Well, well...

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.240
If it isn't Tobio-chan, who was miserably defeated last time.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.520
We've come to win this time.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.220
I depressed the hell out of you last time.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.800
All that's left is that bastard, Ushiwaka.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.410
I'm gonna have you get out of the way again, Tobio.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.930
Take that!

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.020
Is he really a third-year?

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.600
It's way too early to let Oikawa get to him...

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.570
Hey.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.140
Yes?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.880
Karasuno's got another girl.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.640
Yachi-san, I'm sorry!
She's a cute one.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.000
Here.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.230
Yeah... I wonder why I'm feeling so frustrated.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.730
All right...

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.640
Pardon me.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.590
Could you get that?

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.720
Crap! Look out!

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.430
Fly

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.250
So strong...

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.850
Here.
Thanks...

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060
Damn, it didn't work.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.270
Karasuno's guard is too strong.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.970
You're such a showoff, Yahaba-san.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.090
Come on! We're about to start warm-ups!

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.930
Ow.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.840
A-Are you okay?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.600
Kageyama?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.260
Huh?

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.300
Was that guy on Seijoh's team before?

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.610
Who knows?

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.910
Haikyu!!

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.430
Captains.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.280
Let's play.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.280
Episode 20: "Wiping Out."

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.280
I guess you're okay now.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.540
Yeah, thanks.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.590
I got to rest a while, so I'm actually fine.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.700
I see.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.760
You seem like you've aged a bit, Sawamura-kun.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.880
These past four months...

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.720
Another penalty?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.430
You guys must love those.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.200
Hey, hey, hey! You on break?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.270
Then let's practice!

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.720
Hey, hey, hey...
I've been whipped into shape by some other ruffians, so...

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.600
Dunno what you're talking about, but good work.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.820
Tails is Aoba Johsai, heads is Karasuno.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.820
We'll receive first.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.280
Then we'll serve first.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.060
Karasuno Aoba Johsai Line up!

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.310
We're the ones that are gonna win this match.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.370
Yeah.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.700
Let's play!

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.160
Hey! I made it in time.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.630
Hey. The match with Wakunan was pretty brutal this morning.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.320
Really? I wish I'd been able to see it.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.870
Huh?

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.480
Heya! I'm Tanaka Ryunosuke's older sister!

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.890
Hi!

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.840
Tanaka's older sister... They look alike.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.800
They got all the way to the semi-finals.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.960
Yeah.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.560
This is the semi-finals?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.930
Huh? That means...

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.660
Wait. So if they win this one and the next one, they're going to Nationals?!

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.140
Isn't that awesome?!

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.140
Well, only if they beat the next two powerful schools...

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:57.470
Go, go, go, go, Seijoh!

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.230
This will be the third time our current team has fought Karasuno.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.730
Each time, Karasuno has surprised us.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.340
I'm not sure things will go smoothly this time, either,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.440
but if we keep our cool and play, I'm sure we'll see victory.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.470
Do your best, and fight.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.700
Right!

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.660
I hate to say it, but Karasuno's a formidable enemy.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.140
I'm surprised you're being so honest.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.380
I definitely learned from last time.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.800
If we let our guard down, we'll get swallowed up.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.910
So we need to go all-out from the start.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.140
Yeah!

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.850
All right, so...

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.940
I believe... We believe in you, Captain!

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.480
Aw, shucks.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.780
We believe in your serves.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.060
If you miss, you owe us ramen.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.020
I want extra chashu pork in mine.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.460
I'd like a side of gyoza with mine.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.540
No serves that just happen to get over.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.680
Come on, first-years, second-years, you guys can request, too.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.940
Seriously?!

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.360
The crow's broken wing has healed,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.380
and now it's stronger than ever.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.230
The bodies and techniques you've trained for this day...

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.940
Please make sure you go all out, and fly into the huge sky.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.340
If you're able to do everything that needs to be done, results will follow.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.670
That's what I believe.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.760
Right!

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.020
Ukai-kun...

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.040
To be honest, Seijoh's a bad match-up for you.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.330
As is any team that's calm and collected...

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.590
But overcoming them is out only option.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.960
So go overcome that defeat!

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.880
Yeah!

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.050
Go, go, go, go, go, Seijoh!

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.670
Rule the Court

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:36.910
Push it, push it, push it, push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.660
Oikawa-san, nice serve!

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.300
Man, Oikawa's serving first?

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.240
Is he that good?

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.470
Is he?

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.210
He's a frickin' cannon.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.440
If Seijoh's able to build momentum with this serve,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.730
we're going to be in trouble, but...

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.230
And that's very likely.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.770
Nice serve!

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.830
Shoyu!

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:29.730
Tonkotsu!

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.990
Tantanmen!

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.660
Do you want me to get it over, or miss?!

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.120
Sadly, there's no doubt...

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.440
that you're going to get it over.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.570
They were able to get the first serve up!

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.700
All right!

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.400
I think just touching that would rip my arms off!

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.730
Wait! It's going over the net.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.600
They're gonna hit it!

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.680
Nice, Kageyama!

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.880
Kageyama's the first one to touch the ball?

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.200
Then they're screwed.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.680
Their attack will just...

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.170
All right!

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.760
Nice kill.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.130
The ones who just did that are the most surprised about it?!

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.840
Karasuno                  Aoba Johsai

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.200
Nice, Asahi! Nishinoya!

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.980
Yeah!
Thanks!

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.800
All right, let's go,

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.350
all-new Karasuno!

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.160
Kageyama, nice serve!

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.260
One more!

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.740
Makki!

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.450
That's a really good line.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.640
Don't mind! Don't mind!

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.330
So close! We'll get it next time!

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.250
Karasuno                  Aoba Johsai

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.590
Iwaizumi-san, nice serve!

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.780
I'm sure his serves are intense, too.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.050
Bring it!

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.920
Damn it, it's long!

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.270
Sorry, Kageyama!

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.180
Damn, insane serves one after another.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.230
What's with those guys?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.860
Hit it, Kunimi!

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.320
Tanaka, nice kill!

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.080
Thanks!

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.330
I'm surprised he got it in!

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.710
Well done, Ryu! Love ya!

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.290
Hey, Ne-chan, stop it!

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.000
I wanna touch the ball, too.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.970
All right!

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.060
Seijoh and Karasuno's match is awesome.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.480
Oh, really?

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.500
Nice receive!

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.890
Get another one!

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.960
Nice, Mattsun.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.310
Left!

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.980
All right!

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.360
Sorry!

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.240
Sorry. It was a little low.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.410
Karasuno                  Aoba Johsai

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.740
Tsukishima, nice serve!
Go!

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.390
Wow... They're starting off neck-and-neck.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.460
Yeah, but...

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.930
I'd love to see Hinata get a quick over right about now.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.790
Yeah... Why?

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.220
At the end of their last match with Seijoh,

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.440
Hinata's quick had perfect timing,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.280
but it still got completely shut down.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.350
It's something that even we'd never forget.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.160
Nice serve! One more!

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.480
I'm sure it's something that Hinata and Kageyama are never going to get over.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.690
Iwa-chan!

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.910
Daichi-san, nice!

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.410
It's coming!

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.880
All right! He was in a great spot!

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.090
It's coming back! Move back! Back!

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.640
Cover! Cover!

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.800
He's so worked up that he didn't see the block!

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.640
Damn it. I'll get the next one!
Oikawa-san, nice!

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.180
Calm it down, you... uh... dumbass!

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.400
Is that Japanese?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.070
That goes for you, too, Kageyama.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.490
We're counting on you, Iwaizumi-san!

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.740
Damn it, Kageyama... He kicked me for real!

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.640
Nice one-touch!

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.950
One more! One more!

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.260
Got it!

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.830
One more!

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.860
Go!

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.300
That spike, filled with despair...

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.290
Break through it!

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.180
Now...

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.700
We're at the starting line.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:51.510
Haikyu!!

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.240
That #10's awesome!

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.730
Karasuno's really strong this year.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.320
All right!

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.690
Hinata, nice kill!

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.680
That's it, Hinata!

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.400
Now...

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.290
We're at the starting line.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.360
You kicked me for real, you jerk!

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.540
I woke you up, you dumbass!

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.550
What'd you say?!

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.830
Now, now... They've picked themselves back up.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.900
But that's only thanks to my advice.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.520
Those two getting more confident is hardly a good thing.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.300
I know.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.200
Let's take our time and form a strategy.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.260
Yeah!

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.260
Karasuno                  Aoba Johsai

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.550
This is their first set, but that's an impressive score against Seijoh.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.730
Yeah. I didn't think Karasuno would make it this far.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.170
I guess it wasn't just luck last time.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.690
All right!

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.060
Daichi-san, nice receive!

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.910
Are they just going to counter Hinata's slide hit with a receive again?

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.220
All right!

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.560
Nice, Hinata!

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.590
It looks like their #10's off-course spike wasn't just dumb luck.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.450
Don't mind! Don't mind!

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.640
Kageyama, nice serve!

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.260
Sorry, cover!

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.960
We're counting on you, Makki!

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.660
Got it! Kunimi!

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.190
Right!

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.680
Nice kill!

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.070
Nice toss.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.130
They did that like it was nothing.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.320
Damn, they're good.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.480
As usual, Aoba Johsai is playing skillfully.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.060
All of their cogs are working together wonderfully.
Iwaizumi, nice serve!

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.790
Yeah! It's frustrating.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.510
Sorry!
All right!

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.090
Karasuno Aoba Johsai Yeah!

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.630
Makki, nice kill!

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.080
We're counting on you.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.490
Hey.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.260
Bring it!

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.470
The ones who don't do jump serves aim for...

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:04.920
Got it!

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.520
Here it is! The place where the back line setter comes out!

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.230
Nice receive!

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.120
Good! It went up nicely!

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.200
Hinata, go for another slide hit!

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.870
He's going in to block?

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.330
It'll be hard to stop it by myself, but...

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.590
Don't hit it over here.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.960
You can't, right?

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.140
Here it comes! A straight shot right in the face!

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.430
You ignore the cross and wait for a straight.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.100
Kindaichi, nice receive!
They narrowed the course!

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.110
Counter!

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.450
All right!

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.440
So much pressure!

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.260
Those third-years are scary!
Nice receive, Kindaichi!

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.320
Thanks.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.980
Looks like if we narrow the course, we can receive it.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.720
I'll give it a shot next time.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.410
You're scary, Mattsun.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.130
Don't mind, Shoyo. It was close.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.370
They've already thought up a way to counter Hinata's slide hit.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:01.980
Right.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.880
Seijoh's is playing as well as we expected... Indeed.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.280
Each of their players is always thinking up plays and executing them.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.090
That's probably the foundation of Seijoh's strength.

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:14.650
Karasuno Aoba Johsai But...

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:17.970
Nice receive!

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.620
Sugawara-san was saying that with Seijoh's quicks,

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.640
I should wait a little while...

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.260
...then jump!

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.030
All right!

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.240
Got you back!

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.240
Don't act so high and mighty just because you got one.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.450
Yes!

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.950
He's learned from his previous experience.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.320
Karasuno's able to handle us a lot better this go-round.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.670
We can't seem to pull ahead.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.630
Nice receive!

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.760
Karasuno                  Aoba Johsai

00:17:54.910 --> 00:18:00.190
Great, great, Yutaro! Push it, push it, Yutaro! One more time!

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:03.740
Rule the Court And the rotation's gone fully around.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.780
Hey, it's the tears-your-arm-off server...

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.630
Oikawa, nice serve!

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.120
Just in case, watch the back of your head.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.500
Bring it!

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.010
Sorry!

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.840
Damn it!
So close! Nice offensive serve!

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.480
Next, next!

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.720
Lucky, lucky! Let's get another one!

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.670
Huh?! What the hell was that?!

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.700
He can hit the ball even harder?!

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.450
That was basically a spike!

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.040
That felt pretty good against my hand.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.340
Maybe that serve was a fluke... Switch it up!

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.120
No, it wasn't a fluke.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.200
Got it.
At least, I don't think it was.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.920
Did he hit it that hard knowing it was risky?

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.560
That was an insane serve.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.560
I wanna try and get it.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.160
What a sound...

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.920
I can't... Someone's arms are gonna fly off.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.500
Honestly, I don't think I'd be able to get it, either.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.270
It was over here before we even knew he'd hit it.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.440
But... Karasuno Aoba Johsai All right!

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.480
We're at set point!

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.400
Just one more point! Go for it!

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.540
Thanks.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.920
It won't be easy to get it over. Don't put too much strength into it.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.650
Our team is strong when all six of us are strong.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.370
Hey, seriously? Looks like Karasuno might get the first set.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:03.430
Seijoh better think of something fast, or they might be in trouble.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.490
We're gonna take this set! Keep it up!

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:07.590
Right!

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.790
This is no time to panic.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.700
They need to go out there and fight.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.350
Iwaizumi, nice kill!

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.360
Karasuno                  Aoba Johsai

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.710
Great, great, Hajime! Push it, push it, Hajime! One more time!

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.470
If Seijoh gets one more point, it'll be a deuce.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.330
They'll just have to go for the break.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.340
Stay calm! Just one more!

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.520
We're gonna get this one!

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.020
Right!

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.290
Just one more point, and we can take the first set from Seijoh.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.510
Focus on this point!

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.430
Points like this are the worst...

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.770
Yeah... But Seijoh's got it even rougher.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:53.140
Seijoh's changing members now?

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.060
Right now?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.210
It's that guy from earlier.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.140
Yeah... I've never seen that player before.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.450
Yes.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.660
He's not a pinch server,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.520
and yet they're bringing him out for the first time

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.410
when their opponent is at set point...

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.160
Maybe they're just trying to strengthen their left block.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.840
Make sure your spikes don't get caught.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.630
Right.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.150
Iwaizumi-san, nice serve!

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.350
Sorry, it's short!

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.720
Tanaka-san!

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.680
One-touch!

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.820
Chance ball!

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.310
Got it!

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.810
Kindaichi...

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.060
The moment when gears moving smoothly together

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.510
are intentionally changed...

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.930
They become something new entirely.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.490
Like... that #16's spike was all grar, smash!

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.640
But I have to wonder why he's playing volleyball,

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.920
considering how evil his eyes look and how confrontational he is.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.080
Tanaka, all of that applies to you, too.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.500
