00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.690
Our assassination plan went so well

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.150
that Korosensei wound up in his Absolute Defense Form.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.280
Then all this happened.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.070
We can't rely on Korosensei for help.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.790
We have to steal the remedy from the bad guys... alone.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.080
Not counting the ten patients and the two left behind to care for them,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.240
all capable students must sneak in from here,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.260
get the jump on the guys at the top,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.550
and steal that remedy!

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.680
It's too dangerous.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.140
The ease with which he threatened us shows we're up against a real pro.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.850
Yes. Perhaps it would be wisest simply to hand me over.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.600
What do you think?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.610
It's up to all of you.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.820
But... This is...

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.280
It's too hard.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.620
They'll plummet to their deaths before they get anywhere near the hotel.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.550
I knew it. It's no use.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.500
We have to send him with those two.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.540
Nagisa-kun, Kayano-san.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.330
I'm sorry, but—

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.800
Well, if you're worried about the rock climbing,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.380
that much is a piece of cake.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.430
It's nothing compared to our usual training.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.340
Right?

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.180
But we haven't practiced fighting an unknown foe in an unknown hotel,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.640
so, Karasuma-sensei...

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.110
It won't be easy, but could you lead our mission?

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.070
We'll make that jerk pay for messin' with us!

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.780
As you can see, they're no ordinary students.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.160
You have a fifteen-member special forces unit at your command.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.500
Fifteen?

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.460
Don't forget about me!

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.170
Now, there's not much time.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.430
Attention!

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.820
Our objective is the top floor of the hotel at the summit!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.420
Our mission will shift from a stealth infiltration to a surprise attack!

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.810
We'll use the same hand signals and link-ups from training!

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.110
The only difference is our target!

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.570
You have three minutes to memorize the map.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.320
We begin at 2150!

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.360
Right!

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.150

Okano sure can move.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.940
Yeah. She's got the rest of us beat when it comes to gymnastics.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.340
On the other hand, with our teachers...

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.740
One guy has to carry the rest. Literally.
Too shaky! Climb more carefully! Ugh!

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.040
Karasuma!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.710
The students all have exceptional balance.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.420
I have them climb the mountain behind the school.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.880
I see. No wonder they had those flyboards down pat.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.300
Shut up and climb already!

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.930
My hands are getting tired!

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.060
Why did Bitch-sensei come again?

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.230
She didn't want to be left out.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.560
I wouldn't mind... if she wasn't such a dead weight.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.900
Karma-kun, wait!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.150
I'd like to, but we're kind of on a schedule here.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.240
You're right.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.740
Let's do this!

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.120
Mind the sharp rock.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.870
Huh?

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.330
Oh, that was close.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.830
Make it snappy!

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.880
What, are those biceps just for show?

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.340
Still...

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.190
If this guy knows about Korosensei, who could he be?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.310
Ritsu, run a final check of our invasion route.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.270
Yes, sir. Displaying interior map.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.840
Final check:

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.640
We can't use the elevators, as they require a passcard for every floor.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.920
We'll have to take the stairs,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.830
but they're scattered throughout the hotel,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.340
so we'll have to cover some distance on foot.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.960
It's like a TV station.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.210
What do you mean?

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.220
Apparently they have complex layouts to prevent a terrorist takeover.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.420
You sure know a lot about it.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.810
No wonder the bad guys love staying here.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.380
Unlocking side entrance.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.320
Let's go. We're running out of time.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.030
Yes, sir!

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.190
There are more guards than I expected.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.160
It'd be too difficult for us all to get past.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.810
Should only a few of us go on from here?

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.230
No, the chance of facing multiple enemies makes it too risky.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.560
What should we do?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.380
What's the holdup? Just go on through.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.070
Do you have any idea of the situation here, Bitch-sensei?

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.640
How are we supposed to make it past all those guards?

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.520
Just go through!

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.400
Grin.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.030
I'm sorry.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.580
I seem to have had too much of the liquor in my room.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.040
Oh, er, think nothing of it, miss.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.790
I'm the pianist scheduled to perform here next week.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.000
I came early to see the sights.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.740
A pianist, eh?

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.090
We get 'em all the time.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.390
I'd like to see if the piano's in tune. It'll help me sober up.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.100
Could I play a teensy little bit, hmm?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.190
Well, uh... Let me check with the front—

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.440
Aw, come on.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.780
I want you to hear me play.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.530
And then critique me.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.240
C-Critique you?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.850
Yes, critique me carefully...

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.740
and if I do anything wrong, will you scold me?

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.430
She's... She's freakin' amazing!

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.890
Ah, the Fantaisie-Impromptu.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.770
An assassin who not only has obvious skill, but also knows all too well

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.450
how to charm, how to use her wiles...

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.230
Using her whole body in such a bewitching way as she plays:

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.690
it's aural seduction!

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.900
All eyes are on her.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.360
C'mon, don't watch from so far away.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.330
Come closer and make sure I do well.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.000
I'll buy you twenty minutes. Go.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.380
Even we were spellbound,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.340
thinking what a beautiful teacher we had.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.260
We all made it through!

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.220
Isn't Bitch-sensei something?

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.980
Playing like that with those nails?

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.520
She never said anything about being able to play.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.980
There's more to her than what you see every day.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.190
The better the assassin, the broader her skill set.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.080
The woman who's been teaching you conversation skills

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.870
is amongst the top one or two masters of seduction in the world.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.120
So my current immobility won't be a problem.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.020
Let's go!

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.770
Uh-huh!

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.550
Don't let them get the better of you.

we should be able to pose as regular guests.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.510
Guests? Do they put up groups of junior-high kids here?

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.520
Plenty, from what I've heard.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.090
The coddled kids of millionaires and celebrities.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.610
Brought up like decadent royalty,

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.970
they keep innocent faces while dabbling in darker pursuits.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.440
Right! So walk around acting like those kids,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.500
looking down your noses at the whole world!

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.110
Yes, that's the way!

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.550
Is it, now?

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.810
And don't you join in!

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.880
However, we have no idea what our opponent looks like.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.970
He might attack while posing as a regular guest like us.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.350
Proceed with plenty of caution.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.230
Natch!

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.030
Sorry, Okuda... Takebayashi.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.800
I-It's okay.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.490
Their fevers are so high.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.700
At the very least, we need to cool their heads down to avoid brain damage.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.950
G-Got it.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:51.330
Um... Could a virus this powerful spread throughout the island?

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.090
Probably not. I mean, we're okay, right?

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.090
It's likely to be transmitted orally.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.430
It'd have to be mixed into food or drink or something.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.890
I doubt there's any risk of it spreading to a random bystander.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.810
I told the other team that, too.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.360
A virus given to us and us alone...

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.520
But when? And where?

If anything, they avoid eye contact.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.080
No one wants to cause any trouble, after all.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.400
I originally thought we'd have to take on everyone in the hotel,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.630

our point man, Karasuma-sensei, is looking out for all of us.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.260
It'll be a cinch now that we're inside!

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.810
Stay alert.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.240
We don't have time to play around. Let's do this!

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.020
Hey!

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.060
Terasaka-kun! Watch out!

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.280
Gas?!

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.320
Karasuma-sensei!

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.120
How could you tell?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.040
I kill in passing without the slightest hint of bloodlust.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.000
That happens to be my specialty, Helmet Hair.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.030
Aren't you the man who gave us our welcome drinks?

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.010
Please enjoy this tropical juice with our compliments.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.000
Fuwa-san!

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.050
It's downright fishy for someone like that to be walking around in here!

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.060
She's right!

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.560
You've got a good eye.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.270
Then was it you who gave everyone that virus?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.440
That's a pretty flimsy accusation.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.030
There would have been plenty of other opportunities to slip you that stuff.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.130
The only time we all ate or drank the same thing

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.700
was with those drinks and our shipboard dinner.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.700
But Mimura-kun and Okajima-kun worked on the video right through dinner, and they're both sick,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.590
which narrows it down to those daytime drinks.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.550
And that means...

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
the culprit is you, mister!

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.930
That's amazing, Fuwa-san!

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.600
You were just like a detective!

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.750
When you read a lot of shounen manga,

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.230
you learn to adjust quickly to unusual situations.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.300
Magazine and Sunday are chock-full of detective manga hits!

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.230
What about Jump?

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.490
Huh? Jump's detective stuff?

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.700
I don't really know, but they're putting out a compilation.
The solution to this mystery is already on the tip of my tongue.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.990
Better pick one up!

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.120
I get tortured nonstop!

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.370
Neuro Nougami, the mystery-solving demon. Matsui Yuusei's debut title! 12 compilation volumes now available!

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.520
That's the kind of manga this is.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.620
That's nasty!

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.270
Be more subtle with the product placement, Fuwa-san!

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.420
Pay more attention to ethics in marketing!

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.880
I guess even if you've found me out, it's already too late.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.560
A poisoner, eh?

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.010
And quite skilled in practical application.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.240
My very own paralysis gas for indoor use.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.480
One whiff can bring down an elephant.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.440
Fresh air neutralizes it, leaving no evidence behind.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.510
Now, it's plain to see you have no intention of honoring our arrangement.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.010
Negotiations have broken down.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.280
Guess I'll have to tell my boss.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.080
They're fast!

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.700
When did they block the exits?!

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.920
When encountering an enemy...

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.890
...immediately block their retreat path...

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.490
...and cut off communications!

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.760
Isn't that right, Karasuma-sensei?

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:30.300
The minute you saw us, you should've held off attacking

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.930
and gone back to tell your boss.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.140
I'm surprised you can still talk.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.600
But all you have left is a bunch of kids.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.560
Once you're dead,

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.610
they'll stop following orders and just run away!

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.950
S-So strong... And such inhuman speed...

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.370
But y'know, Terrifying Teach...

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.580
your command...

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.840
ends... right... here!

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.560
Ka—

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.550
Karasuma-sensei!

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.920
You can't keep going like this, Karasuma-sensei.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.310
I'll be fine in half an hour.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.480
Don't do anything crazy.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.490
He's the crazy one. That gas was supposed to stop an elephant in its tracks!

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.950
Karasuma-sensei's kind of a monster himself.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.250
A pro with both experience and know-how is really something.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.130
And that's the kind of pro waiting for us up ahead.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.130
Can we beat him with our power alone?

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.260
Man, it sure is starting to feel like summer vacation, am I right?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.350
Well, aren't you happy-go-lucky!

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.520
Says the only one who's absolutely safe!

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.440
Nagisa, twirl him around till he's sick!

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.190
Okay, Terasaka, I'm jamming him in. Drop trou and spread those cheeks!

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.360
That'd kill me!

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.780
Korosensei, why does this feel like summer?

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.820
The teacher-student relationship isn't a cozy one.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:22.750
Summer vacation fosters student independence in places beyond a teacher's protection.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.750
If you apply the lessons you've learned in your usual gym classes,

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.710
there will be few enemies for you to fear.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:34.430
This is your assassination vacation... and you can beat it.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.310
Start with a rich seafood stock.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:42.350
Add plenty of green onions and a spoon of minced garlic...

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.880
and a gun!

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.440
Gotta love a souped-up gun!

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.110
And when the soup trickles through the rifling... That's good eatin'!

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.070
Well, it makes my blood run cold.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.330
That gun's loaded, right?

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.540
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.000
And it'll be just fine when it comes to shootin', too.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.840
I tend to it every night like it's my very own baby boy.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.090
The most delicious gun on any given day is the one that suits me best.

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:17.550
It's kinda like my rule of thumb.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.600
You're a weird one, all right.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.820
Are your two buddies the same way?

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.020
Yeah, well...

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.400
When you've pulled off as many jobs as we have,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.730
you tend to develop your own little obsessions.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.740
For example, Smog makes all his own poisons.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.410
He's so insistent on fine-tuning them for practical use

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.780
that he even made his own lab.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.250
Huh. And the third?

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.790
What about Grip?

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.620
Well...

Hey, why's he just standing out in the open like that?

That vibe he's giving off...

When it comes down to it, he's a killer.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.950
A scenic walkway with an unobstructed view!

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.700
Forget a surprise attack or strength in numbers.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.960
Damn it. I wish I had a gun with real bullets.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.340
I never thought I'd need one here on this island.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.910
What a drag-eth.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.430
I can tell-eth from your footsteps that you're not tough enough for me.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:47.060
And they said some special-forces teacher was tak-eth-ing the lead, too.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.610
I guess Smog's gas must've gotten-eth the better of him.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.190
Probably killed-eth each other at the same time.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.320
Come on out, hm.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.780
He cracked the window with his bare hand!

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.740
B-But more than that...

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:08.080
We're all too afraid to say it, but... well...

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.040
You sure like adding "eth" to things, buddy!

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.330
There it is! Thank goodness for Karma!

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.840
I heard it had a cool old-fashioned sound to it, like-eth a samurai.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.590
It's got a cool ring to it, so I'm try-eth-ing it out.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.550
Oh, so he's a foreigner.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.970
I might-eth be doing it wrong, but that's okay.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.370
After I kill you all here,

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.770
I can drop-eth the "eth" and no one will ever know.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:35.520
Bare hands... Are those your killing tools, then?

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.030
My skills are actually in quite high demand, you know-eth.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.740
Passing through pat-downs is quite the advantage, after all-eth.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.080
When my prey draws close, I snap-eth their necks.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.870
Or if the fancy strikes me, I crush-eth their skulls.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.460
It's funny, you know-eth.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.920
The more you train-eth your strength for the purpose of killing people,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.090
the more you feel-eth like using it for something other than assassination.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.380
To be-eth precise, a fight,

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.550
to the death, against-eth a mighty foe.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.050
But this is quite-eth the letdown.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.750
After seeing who I'm up against, I've all but lost-eth my will to fight.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.400
Not to mention, it's a pain to mop-eth up a bunch of small fry by myself.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.730
I'll call in my boss and my colleague to help-eth out.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.030
Hey, buddy. Chill-eth.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.420
You seem pretty average for a pro, huh?

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.880
Breaking glass, busting skulls?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.660
I can do that much.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.710
But if your opening move is to call in reinforcements,

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.620
I guess that means you're too scared to take on a junior-high kid alone.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.090
No! Don't be reckless!

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.550
Stop right there, Karasuma-sensei.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.510
His chin is down.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.600
So far he's been showing off his swagger with his chin in the air,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.680
looking down on his opponents.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.640
But this is different.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.600
His words may be as rough as ever,

00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:00.070
but his eyes are looking straight ahead, alertly observing his foe head-on.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.900
He'd been lying low ever since finals,

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.530
but it seems he's learned well from his failures.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.450
Very well-eth.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.660
Let's see what you can do-eth.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.750
Give this everything you've got.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.630
You're facing one high wall: an adult!

The left hand plays sextuplets, while the right hand plays octuplets.

The two incompatible rhythms weave together a breathtaking melody.
