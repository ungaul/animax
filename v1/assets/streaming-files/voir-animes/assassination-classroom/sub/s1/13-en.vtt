00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.810
Don't look away!

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.360
Predict your target's moves!

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.240
If you can all do that, you'll block off every last one of his escape routes!

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.660
We're going on our fourth month of training,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.160
and more and more students are showing promise.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.120
Take Isogai Yuuma and Maehara Hiroto.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.480
They've got great reflexes,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.120
and when they work as a pair, their knives hit the mark more often now.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.920
Or Akabane Karma.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.750
He seems like the lazy, laid-back type at first glance,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.510
but there's great eagerness for mischief in those eyes.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.970
Tch!

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.100
And the girls:

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.810
Okano Hinata's unpredictable movement born of her gymnastics background,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.690
and Kataoka Megu, whose reach and physical performance rival the boys'.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.270
These students will make exceptional attackers.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.490
And last but not least, Korosensei: the very model of an ideal teacher.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.900
To kill a man of such character would be unthinkable!

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.990
I didn't ask you to chime in on my monologue.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.370
Get lost, target!

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.160
Although no other students have distinguished themselves,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.620
collectively, their talent has come quite a long way.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570
Ow...

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.550
Sorry!

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.470
I put a little too much force into my block there.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.600
Oh, I'm fine.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.180
You gotta keep an eye on him, you dummy.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.650
Shiota Nagisa...

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.980
The strange presence I just felt... Was it just my imagination?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.280
Man, I just can't hit him!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.990
Karasuma-sensei has, like, no openings at all.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.410
Sensei! Come out for snacks with us after class!

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.890
I appreciate the invitation, but I still have work to do.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.050
Not even in his private life.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.670
It's more as though there's a wall between him and us,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.470
like he's keeping his distance.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.930
He takes good care of us and all,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.890
but is that only because he has to?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.810
Yo, Karasuma!

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.690
Takaoka?

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.030
A new teacher?

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.140
Hey! I'm Takaoka Akira, and I'll be assisting Karasuma as of today!

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.970
And éclairs from Le Hermes!

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.810
Are you sure? They look expensive.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.520
Go on, eat up!

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.140
I emptied my wallet for this, so don't hold back!

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.730
You sure know your brand-name sweets.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.150
Honestly, when it comes to me and sugar, we're in love!

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.240
He sure acts cute for such a big guy.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.860
So will you be taking over P.E. tomorrow?

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.240
Yep! Orders from headquarters.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.450
Gotta lessen Karasuma's load, so—

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.290
Cake... Oh, you must be Korosensei! Help yourself!

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.500
We're still gonna kill you one day, though.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.930
For colleagues, you and Karasuma-sensei are like night and day.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.630
You're like a neighborhood dad!

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.930
Dad, huh? I like that!

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.640
We're in the same class, so that makes us family, right?

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.960
The Next Day The Next Day Great! The gang's all here!

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.450
Now, things might start to get a little tough,

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.240
but I'll have more delicious treats for you when it's all over!

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.540
Sure you're not just saying that because you want to eat them?

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.490
Well, there's a reason I'm this chubby, you know?

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.420
And you're fine with this?

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.260
He comes across as awfully forced.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.090
Not to mention, Karma's cutting his class entirely.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.010
We were in the airborne brigade together.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.180
I understand he's a far better instructor than I.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.240
That ought to go far in training.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.360
Maybe I was going about this the wrong way.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.360
I kept my distance from them as a professional,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.490
but perhaps his method of relating to them like family would have been better.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.440
Now, then!

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.840

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.240
Let's get to work!

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.320
Hey, wait a minute! This is impossible!

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.490
With so little time for learning, our grades'll plummet!

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.780
And what about free time? We can't do this!

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.450
"We can't," nothing. You will.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.420
It's like I said: we're a family, and I'm the dad.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.130
Show me a family that doesn't do as the dad says.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.630

I'll use my authority to bring in new students to replace you.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.720
But I don't want to have to do that.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.770
After all, you're my precious family.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.440
A father doesn't want to lose even a single one of his children.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.230
Let's save the world together, kids—as a family!

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.240
You need only two things to win over your students:

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.030
affection and fear.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.040
Well? You're coming along with your old dad, right?

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.210
Well...

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.640
I, um...

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.710
I don't want to.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.020
I'd rather have Karasuma-sensei's class.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.340
Kanzaki-san!

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.510
Seems you still don't understand.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.600
The only answer here is "yes".

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.810
If that's a problem, we can talk it out with our fists.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.150
That's one of your old dad's specialties!

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.340
Takaoka, stop!

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.150
Are you all right? Does your neck hurt?

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.450
I'm okay.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.450
And you, Maehara-kun?

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.660
Y-Yeah, fine.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.450
I'm going easy on them, Karasuma.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.040
After all, they're my family.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.040
No,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.790
they're not your family.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.660
They're my students.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.630
Korosensei!

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.630
Just what have you been up to while my back was turned?

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.300
Got a problem, monster?

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.100
P.E. is my class to run.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.810
And these punishments fall well within the bounds of education.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.020
I don't have much time to train up these assassins to kill you.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.570
Of course I need to be tough on them.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.030
What's your problem? Just because your views on education differ,

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.030
is that any reason to attack a man who never did you any harm?

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.670
He'll end up crushing those students.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:55.090
It looks wrong to me, but he has his own ideas about education.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.890
That's why, Karasuma-sensei,

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.060
I'd like you, a fellow P.E. teacher, to shut him down.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.690
Me? Shut him down?

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.860
It must really grind your gears, Karasuma—

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.690
my stealing away the students you looked after.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:16.410
You were the best in our brigade, never paying any heed to what I could do.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.620
And now I've snatched away your once-in-a-lifetime chance at making a name for yourself.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.040
Not all of the kids will make it, but that's fine.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.290
If I train whoever's left into fierce assassins and kill that octopus,

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.540
I'll be renowned as the hero who trained those heroes—

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.300
and you'll be at my beck and call!

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.260
Th-This isn't funny!

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.140
Three hundred squats? We'll die!

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.220
Karasuma-sensei...

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:43.820
Hey, now.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.060
Karasuma's not part of our family.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.360
Punishment time.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.820
This is what happens to kids who don't rely on their dad alone!

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.260
That's enough.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.740
If you want to get violent, get violent with me.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:05.040
I figured it was about time you stuck your nose in, Karasuma.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.120
And about time for my next strategy.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.290
It's like I said: this isn't violence, it's education.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.670
I don't want to engage with you through violence.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.050
If we do face off, it'll be as teachers.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:23.310
Choose the best student you trained, Karasuma.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.020
They can fight me,

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.940
and if their knife so much as touches me,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.480
I'll concede that your style of education is better than mine and take my leave.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.190
But we won't be using these old things.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.550
Your target will be me, a human being,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.960
so naturally, you'll need a real knife.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.370
A real knife?!

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.180
Enough!

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.300
They're neither trained nor prepared to kill a human!

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.600
Relax. Stopping just before contact will still count as a hit.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.930
And I'm bare-handed.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.770
What more of a handicap do you want?

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.480
This trick worked wonders in the military too.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.490
Unarmed, I'd beat down a terrified new recruit who'd never held a knife before.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:24.660
Everyone there saw how much I outranked them and became my faithful devotees.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.200
Well, Karasuma? Pick one!

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.960
It's that, or obey me unconditionally!

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.480
I'm still unsure.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.180
Is it right to reject his no-mercy approach

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.060
when the whole world is at stake?

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.230
I've been nothing but unsure ever since I got here.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.230
And even now...

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.980
I'm not sure if I should be exposing a student with potential to this danger.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.660
Nagisa-kun. Will you do it?

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.700
Wait, why Nagisa?

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.120
As someone who charged you with an assassination mission to save the Earth,

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.500
I consider you all fellow professionals.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:20.550
As such, I believe the least you deserve in return is the guarantee of a normal junior-high life.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.970
So you don't have to take this knife if you don't want to.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.640
I'll make every effort to have Takaoka

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.850
continue to provide you what you're owed.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.600
I like his eyes.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.780
Not even family members would look me in the eye like this.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.530
There must be a lot they're keeping from us.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.450
I don't even know why he chose me.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.190
But...

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.750
If he's the one handing me the knife, I know I can trust him.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.840
And I can't let what happened to Kanzaki-san and Maehara-kun slide.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.130
I'll do it.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:10.260
Your eyes must be going bad, Karasuma.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.230
What the hell's he doing?

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.640
Why Nagisa?

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.730
Just watch. You'll see.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.980
You think Nagisa's knife'll hit?

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.360
No way. A real knife against a real pro?

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.450
Nagisa...

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.030
Bring it on!

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.540
A public execution!

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.120
I'll dodge all his attacks, then torment him endlessly.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.880
The students will be so afraid

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.840
they'll come right around to my way of teaching.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.180
Now, listen: for Takaoka, this is combat,

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.600
meant to serve as a warning.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.260
But for you, it's an assassination.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.180
You don't need to demonstrate your strength.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.520
Just make contact once.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.730
That's all you need to win.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.570
By now, he'll have realized what it means to hold a knife.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:14.370
"When you stab someone with a real knife, they die! I can't use this!"

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:20.830
I love seeing the color drain from an amateur's face when that realization hits him!

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.300
I wasn't too sure how to move with a real knife in my hand.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.930
Then I remembered Karasuma-sensei's advice.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.390
That's right. I don't have to fight him to win.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.100
I just need to kill him.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.230
So, with a smile on my face,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.940
I walked right up to him.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.340
Completely normally, as if I was walking to school.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.330
That's when Takaoka-sensei first realized

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.290
that he was about to be killed.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.000
Startled, he lost his balance.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.260
Everyone gets startled when they're about to be killed.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.720
Even Korosensei.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.180
With his center of balance shifted back,

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.640
I grab his shirt, pull him down,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.100
and go in for the kill.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.310
He can block a blow from the front,

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.770
so I circle around behind him,

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.980
and sure enough...

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.320
Gotcha.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.110
Holy hell... He's exceeded my every expectation!

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.910
You'd never find that kind of talent living an everyday life!

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.380
The talent to hide his bloodlust on his approach,

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.500
to use that bloodlust to frighten his foe,

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.750
and to be so self-assured throughout the whole process!

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.180
That chill I felt during training...

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.430
What if that had been a real assassination?

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.640
It's not combat or violence that he has a knack for—

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.270
it's assassination!

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.020
Should I even encourage that kind of talent?

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.060
Oops! Was I not supposed to use the back of my knife?

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.480
That's enough.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.740
We have a winner, Karasuma-sensei.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.990
Honestly, what were you thinking, giving a real knife to a student?

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.250
What if he'd hurt himself?

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.290
You'd have been in there at Mach speed to patch him up.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.670
You did it, Nagisa!

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.630
Oh, thank goodness!

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.090
That was a hell of a fight!
But still...

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.000
You sure know your way around with a knife!

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.760
Nah, I just did what Karasuma-sensei told me.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.720
Takaoka-sensei's pretty tough.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.760
Ow!

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.260
What was that for?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.520
Sorry. I kinda didn't believe it was really you.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.350
But thanks! That assassination was a total rush!

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.110
Holding up the knife with a smile, and then that "Gotcha"?

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.780
What a man's man you turned out to be!

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.940
You were pretty lost out here today, weren't you, Karasuma-sensei?

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.440
I was just relieved it went well, that's all!

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.990
Got a problem?

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.450
No, no.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.240
You brat...

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:05.790
How dare you turn on your father figure and laugh it up over some fluke victory!

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.290
I demand a rematch!

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:11.760
I'll rend you in two, body and soul!

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.350
If we fought again, I'd lose for sure.

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.970
But what's plain to see

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.520
is that Korosensei is our teacher,

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.890
and Karasuma-sensei is our training instructor.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.190
And that's final.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.070
You and your forced father-figure role

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.570
don't come across half as warm

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.360
as Karasuma-sensei and his professionalism.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.410
We're grateful you really tried to make us stronger...

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.330
but I'm sorry. Please leave.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.300
Wait, what am I?

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.720
You're our bitch.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.300
You're dead.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.720
A teacher's happiest moment

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.890
is when a student gives a clear answer to a lesson of yours in which you yourself are unsure.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.640
And, Karasuma-sensei...

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:12.820
I'm not gonna stand here and listen to this brat spoutin' off!
A teacher must give a clear answer in response as well.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.120
I apologize for the trouble caused by my colleague.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.500
Don't worry. Leave this to me.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.840
I'll negotiate with my superiors to resume my teaching position.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.590
Karasuma-sensei!

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.800
You think I'll let you get one over on me like that?

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.520
I'll negotiate with them first and—

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.470
There's no need to negotiate.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.140
Principal Asano!

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.150
I was curious to see our newest teacher in action

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.570
and ended up watching the whole thing.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.560
Takaoka-sensei, your lesson was a joke.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.990
Yes, fear is a must in education.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:04.830
But a teacher who can only instill fear through violence

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.830
is a teacher of the lowest order indeed.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.960
B-But... I... Your dismissal notice.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.590
The Ministry of Defense has no hiring rights here.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.430
I call the shots at this place. And don't you forget it.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.250
Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit...

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.350
Damn it all to hell!

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.860
Takaoka got fired?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.030
So it's back to Karasuma-sensei again?

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.570
Hooray!

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.410
He's as confident as ever in his views on education.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.160
What if...

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.040
If he said he wanted to be an assassin when he grew up,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.380
would you still be able to train him with zero hesitation?

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.010
He may not realize it, but he has what it takes.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.510
That's a tricky one, to be sure.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.470
But I think every teacher has doubts.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.690
We secretly wonder if we're giving them our best answers,

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:18.820
but we must keep a cool head in front of our students—

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.280
ever majestic, never letting them see us waver.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.780
And that's why teaching is such a great profession!

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.370
Karasuma-sensei?

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.580
Since it was us students who got you your P.E. job back,

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.840
don't you think we should get some kind of reward?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.670
Yeah! That's one thing Takaoka-sensei was great at!

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.090
I don't know about sweets.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.010
Here, get something you—

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.970
Yes!

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.810
Let me in on that reward too!

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.270
Huh? What for?

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.860
You barely even did anything this time!

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.900
No, no, no!

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.070
I watched in silent contemplation so Karasuma-sensei could learn the value of being a teacher!

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.450
Never mind him. Let's go, Karasuma-sensei!

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:11.500
I might be getting a little hooked on this place

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.250
and the fun of training people despite my doubts.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.920
He's coming after us on his hands and knees!

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.090
Just how badly does he want it?

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.050
Please, please, please, please, please—

Ne xt Ep iso de
Yaru, or "to kill," a verb commonly used in our class,

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.500
can be conjugated as yaranai, yarimasu, yarutoki, yareba, yareyo, and yarou.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.720
All five characters in the ra column are used as bases, so it's a quintigrade conjugation.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.860
Nagisa-kun, keep in mind that a verb has quintigrade conjugation if the nai form ends with -anai.
