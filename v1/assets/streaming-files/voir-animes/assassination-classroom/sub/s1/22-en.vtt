Nagisa...

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.100
snapped!

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.940
Sure, we'd all like to kill that rotten son of a bitch.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.820
but Nagisa might just go through with it!

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.950
No! You have to stop—

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.500
Don't be gettin' cocky, Nagisa!

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.960
I saw the pitiful way you looked at me when that medicine got blown up!

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.150
Quit worryin' about other people, ya damn wimp!

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.520
This virus'll go away by itself with a good night's sleep!

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.100
Terasaka... You mean—

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.690
Murder is murder, even if it's a piece of trash like that.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.320
You gonna give in to the crazy and throw your chance at ten billion out the window?

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.290
Terasaka-kun's right, Nagisa-kun.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.960
Killing him isn't worth it,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.330
and being in a blind rage will only work against you.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.140
Besides, he doesn't know anything about the remedy.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.040
We'll ask the poisoner downstairs.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.670
Just knock him out. That's enough.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.010
Hey now, quit being a wet blanket!

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.340
If he doesn't come at me with true killing intent, what's the point?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.510
I'll use this squirt's bloodlust for revenge in a most humiliating way,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.560
and finally my own shame will disappear!

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.150
Nagisa-kun, take Terasaka-kun's stun gun.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.710
His life, or my life. His words, or Terasaka-kun's words.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.910
Think carefully, now: which are more worthy?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.330
Terasaka!

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.250
You... You've got one hell of a fever!

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.250
How'd you even make it here like this?

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.210
Shaddup. You wanna look at somethin', look there.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.740
Do it, Nagisa.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.010
Kill him to within an inch of his life.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.490
Ooh, don't you look cool!

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.010
Korosensei, Nagisa's put the stun gun away!

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.030
I see you're determined to use the knife. That's a relief.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.830
Oh, and just so you know,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.600
I do have some spare vials of that remedy.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.930
If you don't come at me like you mean it,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.150
or if your pals get in our way,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.350
you can kiss these babies goodbye.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.200
Hear that, Karasuma? Stay out of this!

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.110
This stuff takes a good month to make.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.030
There's not enough for everyone, but it is your last hope.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.570
Karasuma-sensei.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.250
If you determine that Nagisa-kun's life is in danger,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.660
please don't hesitate to shoot Takaoka-sensei.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.990
For him to say that when he can usually see what's coming...

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.340
This must be our most dangerous predicament yet.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.670
Even I can tell that much.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.140
We may have managed to defeat those three assassins on our own terms...

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.720
but now the tables are completely turned!

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.100
Even if Shiota Nagisa did try to turn this into an assassination...

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.820
What's wrong? Aren't you going to kill me?

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.950
Takaoka's an entirely different man.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.440
He's in battle mode!

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.630
Even with a mind gone mad, he's still an elite soldier.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.630
His impregnable defense will shut down any surprise attack!

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.670
The build!

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.930
The skills!

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.140
The experience!

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.310
Defeating him is far harder than scoring in first place in the national mock exams.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.740
It's not even a contest.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.650
There's no way he can beat that monster!

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.860
Hey, don't go getting tired on me.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.690
We're only just getting started!

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.290
Looks like it's time for me to pull out one of these too.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.330
A traumatic image accompanies his knife in my dreams.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.710
When he caught me off-guard with that smile of his—

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.800
that's when everything went off the rails.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.260
I will not make the same mistake again.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.040
I'll cut off your hands and feet and have them stuffed and mounted.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.710
I'll keep them with me and cherish them forever.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.930
Karasuma-sensei! You've got to shoot him!

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.940
Nagisa's gonna die!

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.100
Wait.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.110
Stay out of it!

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.410
Are we still leaving them to it, Terasaka?

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.830
I'm just about ready to join the fray myself.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:22.250
You been skippin' practice, Karma, so you don't know, but Nagisa...

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.300
He's still got somethin' up his sleeve.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.840
Was that the deadly technique?

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.220
Yes. But then again,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.760
it didn't look like one, did it?

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.360
When I was in a tight spot as an assassin,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.150
I used this to squeeze my way out.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:46.650
But it has conditions that must be met—three of them.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.900
First: you must have two weapons.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.570
Second: you must be up against an expert.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.370
And third: your foe must know the terror of being killed.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.040
Good.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.040
That's all of them.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.310
What... Takaoka-sensei...

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.430
Will you be my guinea pig?

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.560
Wh-What are you doing?!

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.480
A deadly technique doesn't necessarily kill instantly.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.810
Given the ideal conditions, of course, any assassin can do the deed.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.700
But reality is rarely that agreeable,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.290
especially when your target is a pro with an airtight defense.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:44.290
This technique can reliably create an ideal killing situation in such a bind.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.760
It sets the stage for an instant kill.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.560
Sets the stage, huh?

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.910
Move from a standstill, as fast as you can,

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.760
as far as you can, and make it as loud as possible.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.350
You... lousy... brat!

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.060
This works best when they're almost within range.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.690
The closer you get, the more the target will focus on your knife.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.490
Gently let go of that knife in midair while their attention is on it, and then...

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.220
What... just... happ—

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:41.890
An assassin...

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.730
will not overlook those few moments.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.150
In one fluid motion, swiftly draw your second blade, and...

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.440
It... can't be...

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.340
This brat... got me... again?!

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.610
Finish him off, Nagisa.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.010
A good jolt to the neck'll knock him out cold.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.030
He taught me bloodlust.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.160
That some kinds of bloodlust are wrong to hold on to,

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.820
and how important it is to have friends to pull you away from that.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.570
The pain of being hit, the fear of a real fight...

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.750
I've learned so much from this man.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.450
He'd done terrible things, but setting that aside,

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.050
I thought I ought to thank him for his lessons.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.360
And I figured... No...

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.430
...I couldn't thank him without putting on a smile.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.560
Just, please... don't end this with that smile of yours!

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:19.940
That face will haunt my nightmares until the day I die!

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.490
Takaoka-sensei...

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.580
Thank you.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.690
Yes!

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:46.970
We beat the boss!

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.770
Hooray!

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.570


00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.790
Not bad.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.120
You okay, Nagisa?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.040
Yeah.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.880
Well done, Nagisa-kun.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.050
I was so worried about how things would turn out. I'm relieved.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:26.100
Right. I'm fine, but... now what?

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.720
The remedy we took from Takaoka-sensei won't be enough.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.690
Let's start by getting out of here.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.770
I've called a chopper, so you wait here.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.110
I'll bring up the poisoner.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.110
Ha. You're not gonna need no stinkin' remedy.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.830
You brats thought you could get out of here alive, eh?

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.370
We've defeated the man who hired you.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.410
You have no further reason to fight us, right?

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.790
I've mostly recovered, and these students are plenty strong.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.800
How about we stop now before anyone else gets hurt?

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.340
Yeah, okay.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.800
You just don't know when to give up—

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.680
Wait, "okay"?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.060
Our contracts don't cover avenging the boss.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.400
Besides, it's like I said: you don't need any remedy.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.690
This here's what I gave you:

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.530
a souped-up version of the common stomach bug.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.030
It'll keep going strong for another three hours or so,

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:30.330
but then it'll rapidly lose its efficacy and become harmless.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.000
Now, this is what our boss told us to use.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.330
If we had, you'd really be in dire straits.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.420
Right before using that virus, we three talked-eth it over.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.260
Our boss only gave-eth you one hour.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.430
We figured we could do the handover without having to resort-eth to a deadly virus.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:53.310
It was enough to make you feel like your lives were in danger, anyway.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.090
So you went against orders?

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.770
Can you do that when he's paying you?

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.150
What are you, stupid?

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.480
If you think pros will do anything for money, you got another thing comin'.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.930
We'll do our best to abide by our client's wishes, of course...

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.370
I'll blow this remedy up right before their eyes.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.410
Oh, I can't wait to see their faces crushed with despair!

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.840
...but he never had any intention of giving you the remedy.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:25.630
So either we become the killers of a bunch of respectable junior-high kids,

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.130
or we take a hit to our professional standing.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:33.890
We just calmly weighed up which option posed a greater risk to our future.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:40.310
And that's why, sorry to say, none of you will be dying.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.460
Give the patients that supplement and put 'em to bed.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.030
Just like it says on the tin, they'll feel even better than before they were sick.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:53.610
I'll believe it once I see those students home safe and sound.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:57.200
We'll need to detain you for a while for questioning.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:03.480
Ah, well. You've got a week to wind it up before our next job starts.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.590
What's this?

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.420
Not going-eth for a rematch, buddy?

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.640
Aren't you just thirsting for revenge?

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.560
I don't kill-eth people out of spite.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.890
I'll wait for the day someone puts-eth a hit out on you.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.110
You'd better become-eth someone worth targeting.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.820
And there you have it, kids!

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.320
If you really want us to come kill you, you've gotta make it big first!

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:36.200
Then we'll give you the pro assassin's grand tour!

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.630
The assassins were gone,

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.340
having left us with their own words of encouragement of sorts.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.230
One buzz from Karasuma.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.310
That's the signal that they've escaped.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:00.760
Hey, I wanna go down the mountain and see the ocean.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.940
Won't someone drive me down there?

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.770
Me! Me me me! Pick me!

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:12.150
And so our big infiltration mission was completed with no one at the hotel the wiser.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.120
Terasaka-kun?

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.200
Thanks for calling me out back then.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.990
I was about to make the wrong move.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.830
Pfft.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.250
One less student'd make it that much harder to kill that octopus.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.670
Yeah. Sorry.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.590
We went back to our hotel, where everyone was waiting

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.470
and told them it was going to be okay.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.810
We slept like logs, each of us tired out in different ways,

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.480
and when we woke, it was evening on the next day.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.860
That was one crazy day.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.860
I'm just glad we got through it in one piece.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.590
You were the one in the most danger, you know!

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.660
Sorry.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.220
You do get into sticky spots now and then.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.290
We worry, you know!

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.750
Good morning!

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.520
Or should I say "evening"?

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.760
Feeling better?

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.930
Yes, thank you.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.140
I see everyone's in their P.E. gear.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.390
We're the only guests, and these are nice and comfy.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.980
And it'd be cruel to have to think up a whole new day's worth of outfits.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.350
Say what?

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:27.630
So Korosensei's in there?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.710
Yeah. It's not like it's going to work,

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.070
but he's in there nice and tight so we can kill him when he reverts.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.200
Karasuma-sensei has been leading the charge without rest.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.600
He shows no signs of fatigue at all. Pretty amazing!

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:44.000
He really is. I wonder if we'll be as awesome as him in ten years.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.290
Who knows?

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.630
Bitch-sensei might not look like it, but she's great too.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.420
So were the assassins we met at the hotel.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.920
Those moves mastered through long years of experience

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.670
Go, me.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.220
and their work ethic really inspired me.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:56.880
Gimme a max potion.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:03.220
Then there are people like Takaoka who I really don't want to turn into.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.100
We follow people we admire and leave behind the ones we reject.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.230
Growing up is probably just doing that over and over again.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.610
What was that explosion?!

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.740
Did we get him?!

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.200
Even as we asked that,

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.160
we already knew the answer.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.330
You suffered so much on account of my cowardice.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:36.470
But you battled enemies and a virus— and did a fine job of it too.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.380
Good morning, Korosensei.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.800
You're just not the same without your tentacles.
Morning!

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.390
Good morning, students.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.270
Now, let's enjoy the rest of our trip, shall we?

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.140
You bet!

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.100
But we're going back tomorrow morning.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.560
Say what?!

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.860
With all the time I spent in my Absolute Defense Form, I've barely gotten to enjoy myself at all!

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.070
Well, you're sure full of energy.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.530
This is a one-time thing: summer camp with my students!

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.540
We Love Summer!

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.700
We can't waste a single second!

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.160
What are you doing?!

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.960
You just said not to waste a single second, right?

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.130
Ah yes, Karma-kun.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.340
Wait until your target lets down his—

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.800
Hey, hey, hey!

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.380
I thought this might be our chance to do him in.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.800
Want to take a shot, Nagisa-kun?

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.600
We've got to make the most of the time we have!

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.560
I'm all for that!

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.600
Here goes!

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.930
Wait up!

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.100
Over here!

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.160
Since I'm feeling better and all...

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.650
You put on a swimsuit underneath?

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.110
Well, I didn't!

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.150
Ha!

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.490
Now you've done it!

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.860
Lemme at 'em!

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.110
Hooray!

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.280
Me too, me too!

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.080
Sure!

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.370
Wait, I'm just going to swell right up, aren't I?!

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:51.960
Tch!

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.170
He realized.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.130
That's right. This is it!

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.800
This is what summer's all about!

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.010
Hey, me too!

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.470
Let me—

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.050
Die!
Bit on the small side, huh?

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.260
Now, students, there'll be fireworks after this!

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.060
Don't forget to play with me too!

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.680
That octopus...

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.600
Karasuma-san, should we start heading out?

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.390
Yes, please do.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.980
Hang on!

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.360
I thought you were busy burying him in concrete!

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.990
You should've invited me if you were heading to the beach!

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.490
What a swimsuit!

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.450
What desperation.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:26.830
Shut it, you brats!

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.160
Hey, Karasuma, what do you say?

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.460
Let's leave these kids behind and check out that—

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.540
Whatever.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.880
You really are a bitch.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.400
What was that?!

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.050
You squirts have been giving some real cheek lately!

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.130
Don't you mess with me, brats!

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.340
Get back here!

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.090
You did well.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.190
Our E Class—the End Class— is the assassination classroom.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.650
We are killers,

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.200
and our target is our teacher.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.240
Good morning, students.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.620
Time for a second term full of hard work in studying and assassination alike!

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.730
And in this assassination classroom we share with Korosensei...

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.790
the bell signals the start of another school day.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.020
