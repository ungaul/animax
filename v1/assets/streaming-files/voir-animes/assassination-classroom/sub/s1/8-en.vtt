Your target this time is a teacher currently leading students on a school trip.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.290
You may have heard that this teacher is not human.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.120
It's not that I doubt your skill...

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.210
but please make all necessary preparations.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.050
The name's Red Eye. I'm an assassin. A sniper.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.310
Wow! You can really take in the scenery with no windows in the way!

School Trip, Day 2: Free Time, Group 1

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.250
With an open train like this, I won't get motion sick, and 25 km/h is plenty fast.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.070
Says the guy who can move at Mach 20.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.200
Almost there...

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.520
The sniper spot we've chosen...

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.170
is a famous stop along the Sagano sightseeing train line:

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.050
The Hozu River Bridge.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.840
We'll be making a brief stop on the bridge.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.300
Oh, look, Korosensei!

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.970
They're going downstream!

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.590
Let me see... Ooh!

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.500
Our sniper's cue...

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.150
is the moment Korosensei leans out the window to look at the boat.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.730
I downed a target at two klicks

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.300
in the midst of a furious sandstorm in the Middle East.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.780
Under these conditions, it'll be a lead-pipe cinch.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.200
Well? That should've been a headshot.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.500
He stopped it with a folded pastry?!

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.380
Whoops! Found a tiny bone in my Kyoto pastry.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.340
That could've been ugly.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.790
Inconceivable!

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.420
A high-spin rifle bullet,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.680
stopped cold by a soft, uncooked sheet of dough?

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.390
That'd require ridiculous speed!

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.370
Now I understand the ten-billion-yen bounty.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.700
We've been tasked with killing one extraordinary monster.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.270
This'll be fun.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.740
I care not for needless loss of life.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.330
How dare you!

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.260
Come on, men! Get him!

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.700
Wow!

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.380
Their swords look so fast this close up.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.050
They move very deliberately to make it appear that way.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.180
I happen to love this kind of swordplay.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.900
Whoa! They're coming this way!

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.040
Over here, Sensei!

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.060
Huh? Where?

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.830
The actors are leading the target around nicely.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.240
Just as I arranged.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.010
Now, while he's distracted by the show...

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.410
Huh?

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.450
Where'd he go?

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.990
Hey! What the hell's he doing?!

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.730
When did he get in there with the actors?

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.120
I shall assist.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.890
Blood-cherry blossoms are the only flowers that bloom for evil.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.680
He knows exactly what to say, too!

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.890
If he's in there with the actors...

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.960
how am I gonna hit him?!

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.060
Your target is extremely fast.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.020
Don't let his unconventional movements throw you off.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.980
There's unconventional, and then there's this!

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.360
Next!

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.470
I will kill him. My reputation rests on it.
2:20 PM: Five-Story Pagoda: Free Time, Group 3

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.530
You're late, Korosensei!

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.090
My apologies. I got caught up starring in a samurai drama.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.130
Say what?

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.080
We finished Kiyomizu Temple ages ago.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.370
Then let's trawl Nineizaka Street for souvenirs.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.920
Like you care about anything but sweets.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.130
Repairs in Progress Pardon Our Dust Good.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.130
Repairs in Progress Pardon Our Dust

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.510
I can draw a steady bead on him here.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.170
A straight shot from Yasaka's five-story pagoda!

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.840
Korosensei, try this blotting paper.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.610
I'm a bit embarrassed for you to see what it picks up.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.570
Come on, come on.
But if I must...

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.530
At the foot of Sanneizaka, a student will distract him with souvenirs,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.990
and in that moment...

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.370
Yes! Right through the temple!

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.160
That's not supposed to be bullet-blotting paper!

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.480
What did I tell you? See how much mucus it picked up?

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.460
You could stop a bullet with this stuff!

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:43.880
Hmm?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.190
It's from Nagisa-kun's group.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.470
Hello?

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.870
Where are you?

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.980
What... What the hell is he?

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.100
His speed and defense is impeccable.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.810
It's like he was built for the express purpose of being unkillable.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.070
Hello?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.260
Oh, Karasuma-san.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.390
I'm afraid we're done for today.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.480
The next group you were supposed to work with, Group 4,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.160
has run into a spot of trouble with some high schoolers.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.390
The target is currently rushing to their aid.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.470
All right. Understood.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.140
I was thinking of calling it quits, anyway.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.810
In the eight years I've spent as an assassin,

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.750
not once have I failed to see my target's blood through my scope.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.180
That's how I got my name: Red Eye.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.440
It's laughable.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.790
My eyes aren't seeing anything red, are they?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.200
Here you go.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.300
A chili spice mix I bought along Sanneizaka.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.630
Oh, it's you. Thanks.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.550
Wait, it's you!
My assassination target?!

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.260
I've taken care of the trouble my students were in,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.970
and since you spent the day sightseeing alongside us,

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.840
I thought I'd come pay my respects.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.400
So you saw all that coming and just played along?

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.480
With a monster like you at large,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.570
no wonder the government's trying so hard to cover up the matter.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.180
So, you gonna kill me?

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.120
Go on, then. Do it.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.170
I knew the risks when I chose this line of work.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.750
I have no regrets.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.910
Just eat it already!

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:48.050
Korosensei's Weak Point #11:

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.430
Korosensei's Weak Point #11:
His mouth can't handle the heat

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.170
Of course I'm not going to kill you.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.140
You made this school trip most enjoyable.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.450
I just wanted to thank you.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:05.440
My students must've done some especially in-depth research into Kyoto in order to find good places to kill me.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.940
The geography, the terrain,

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.230
its highlights, history, origins...

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:16.820
In short, they had more opportunities than usual to discover the city's charm.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.040
To understand people, places, and the atmosphere...

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.000
These lessons they have learned via assassination will enrich their lives.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.380
Here you go.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.240
And so, I look forward to my assassination.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.510
Your mind's just as crazy as your body, man.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.390
But you know...

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.100
Somehow...

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.440
You're one hell of a teacher.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.150
You're out?

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.610
Yeah, sorry. I'd like to do some sightseeing on my own.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.380
Turns out I'm still a novice when it comes to assassination.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.610
I'd like to go around and take in all kinds of colors, not just the one.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.540
Now, then...

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.490
What color will paint my scope tomorrow?

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.430
Dammit! How the hell are you dodging those?

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.680
This is... a little embarrassing.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.900
She's smiling gently while moving her hands like a pro!

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.570
Wow! I had no idea you were this good at games, Kanzaki-san!

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:39.820
I kept it quiet. In my family, frivolity's frowned upon.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.120
But maybe I've been too worried about what others think.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.160
Clothes, hobbies, status...

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.060
I ran from it, got swept up in it, and wound up lacking confidence.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.670
But Korosensei made me realize:

00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:00.100
you just need the person you are on the inside to face forward and do their best.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.890
Kanzaki-san has an unexpected side to her, too.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.270
I wonder what she and Kayano talked about while they were kidnapped.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.020
They seem to get along so naturally now.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.270
Ack! They got you!

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.110
That's too bad.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.820
There!

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.780
You okay?

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.240
Almost every sniper turned down the job after seeing its difficulty,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.370
and the only one who accepted ended up quitting prematurely.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.280
Take that!

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.500
And Takebayashi bites the dust! Who's next?
So much for our plans to snipe him here in Kyoto.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.580
C'mon, Karasuma-sensei! Let's play table tennis!

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.550
I can't impose on their school trip any further.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.780
From here on out, it's their free time.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.420
Sure.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.730
I'm pretty good, though.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.220
This traditional inn's a real dump, isn't it?

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.680
One big bedroom each for the boys and girls?

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.770
The students in the other classes get personal hotel rooms.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.860
It's fine. This way's more fun.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.720
Hey.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.030
What are you two up to?

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.900
Shh!

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.510
Isn't it obvious? We're peeping!

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.570
Peeping?!

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.240
Hey! That's our job!

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.040
I wouldn't say it's anyone's job, per se.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.700
Men's Bath Men's Bath Men's Bath
Can you still say that after seeing this?

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:11.750
Men's Bath

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.040
Clothes hung like that mean their wearer is in the bath.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.340
You catch my drift?

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.800
Y-Yeah.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.140
This is our chance to see what's inside Korosensei!

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.760
Does he have some kind of body, or is it tentacles all the way down?

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.350
Where's the harm? It could even help us assassinate him.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.560
This has to be the least sexy act of peeping ever.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:39.730
What is he, a girl?!

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.280
Ah, hello, students.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.780
Why the bubble bath?

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.200
You're not supposed to add things to the water here.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.490
This is my mucus.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.370
It raises a nice, brisk lather and deep-cleans stubborn dirt.

Artist's Impression That body of yours does it all.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.670
But you slipped up.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.670
We're between you and the exit.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.800
When you get out, you'll have to pass by us.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.140
We might not be able to kill you, but we will see you naked!

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.850
I teacherly object!

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.100
Jellied broth?!

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.560
Oh, dear. I'm starting to feel a tad cold.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.520
He got away.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.150
This whole peeping thing didn't really work out, Nakamura.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:26.360
We sure learned a lot about one another on this school trip.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.410
We didn't get any closer to determining Korosensei's true nature, though.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.220

Y'know, with all the crap that went down,

we didn't get many chances to actually talk.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.310
Yeah, you guys had it rough.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.770
The real question is who voted for who.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.670
I can't pick just one!

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.060

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.530
Huh?

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.990
I, uh... What about you, Maehara? Which girl?

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.000
Me? My lips are sealed.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.210
That pisses me off! Especially when I think about how popular guys like you are!

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.920
Oh, looks like you guys are having fun.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.790

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.330
Great timing!

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.250
Is there a girl you like?

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.710
Hmm... Okuda-san, maybe?

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.010
Wow, saying it straight, huh?

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.430
Interesting choice! But why?

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.770
I bet she could make some sketchy drugs, or some chloroform, or whatever.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.180
I could do all kinds of things with those.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.690
That's one matchup we can do without.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.020
These ratings are just between us guys, okay?

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.780
Well, sure.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.400
I mean, it's not like we want this stuff getting out.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.110
So whatever you do, do not let the girls or the teachers find—

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.070
Evening, students.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.030
Student Data - Boys (3)
Aha. I see.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.110
He took notes and split!

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.580
Kill him!

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:07.340
Nabbing this data is exactly what my ultra-high speed is for!

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:07.210
Korosensei's Weak Point #12:

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.010
Korosensei's Weak Point #12:

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.720
Loves gossip Huh? What boys we like?

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.850
Yeah! That's what girls talk about on these trips. It's fun!

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.600
Ooh, ooh! I've got one! Karasuma-sensei!

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.530
Yeah, yeah. We all like Karasuma-sensei.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.440
I mean someone in our class.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.520
Huh?

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.440
I guess Isogai and Maehara are pretty all right.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.360
Really? You think so?

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.080
Sure. Unfortunately, Maehara's a bit of a player,

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.750
but Isogai's class president, so doesn't that put him in the lead?

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.460
Karma-kun would be up there too on good looks alone.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.670
If only he were a little better behaved.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:48.380
Yeah... Hmm... He's really not that scary, though.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.970
Yeah, he's usually pretty quiet.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.380
What, is he a wild animal now?

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.630
What about you, Kanzaki-san?

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:57.260
Huh? I don't really... Oh, is that so?

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.770
C'mon, spill it!

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.410
I'm sure the boys are dying to know too! Fess up!

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.350
No, seriously!

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.940
Listen up, brats.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.030
I'm here to tell you it's almost lights out. Strictly speaking.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.780
"Strictly speaking"?

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.450
Well, it's not like you won't stay up talking anyway.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.620
Just keep it down, all right?

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.250
How come you get to drink? That's so unfair!

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.170
What did you expect? I'm a grown-up.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.920
I know! Tell us some of your grown-up stories, Bitch-sensei!

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.590
Huh?

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.300
They'd be way more useful than your usual classes!

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.880
What was that?!

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.760
All right, all right...

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.720
Bitch-sensei, you're only twenty?!

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.720
With all your experience, I was sure you were older.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.690
Yeah, and you've got that whole black widow thing going on.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.110
Right, the sex appeal of a black widow that only living large can—

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.860
Wait, who called me a black widow?!

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.440
You're a little late on the comeback there.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.650
Now, listen here! Women have a short shelf life.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.330
Unlike me, you were lucky enough to be born in a country free from danger.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.250
Be grateful, and polish your femininity with all your might.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.440
Wow, Bitch-sensei actually said something kind of sensible.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.830
She oughta stay in her lane.

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.460
Don't toy with me, you brats!

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.050
But, but, but...

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.970
We wanna know about the men you seduced!

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.890
Yeah, tell us!

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.510
Very well, then.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.060
This might be a little spicy for your delicate, young palates, so watch out.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.730
Now, when I was seventeen... Hey, you there!

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.570
You think you can just waltz into our girl talk, all casual-like?!

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:31.860
Aww.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.200
What's the problem? I'm as interested in your tales of romance as the next octopus.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.700
That's easy for you to say, Korosensei!

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.330
You never tell us anything about your private life!

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.380
Yeah! Fair's fair!

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.620
Don't you have any romantic stories of your own?

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.670
You're into boobs, right? You must've at least had a crush on someone!

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:55.760
He flew the coop!

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.140
Let's catch him, make him talk, and then kill him!

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.050
There he is!

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:00.100
Murder him!

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.140
Over here!

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.600
Rats! A pincer attack!

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.600
I guess it ended up as an assassination attempt after all.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.900
Yeah.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.320
Where'd you go?!

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.070
Phew. That sure was a close one.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.740
What was all the commotion?

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.120
The students almost got me to spill the beans about my love life.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.160
Your love life?

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.250
My past is positively packed with tales of romance.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.380
Why, I couldn't hope to count them on all my hands and feet.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.630
Was this back when you had two hands and two feet?

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.060
Well, I won't go there.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.150
You probably won't talk about it, anyway.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.900
You're a wise man, Karasuma-sensei.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.100
Even while traveling, it is most uncouth to ask after the number of one's appendages.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.780
That was one fun school trip,

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.620
what with getting to see different sides of everyone and all.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.790
Uh-huh.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.830
What's wrong?

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.670
I was just thinking...

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.380
It feels like our school trip is almost over, right?

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.430
But our way of life has only just begun,

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.880
and we don't know if the world will end next year or what.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.970
Yeah.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:29.640
But either way, this class will be over next March.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.440
Yeah, it will.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.610
Whether it's learning more about everyone, or killing Korosensei...

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.150
I want to make sure I don't leave anything undone.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.240
For now, I'd just like one more school trip, you know?

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.450
School Trip Guidebook
Kunugigaoka Junior High School, Class 3-E Yeah.
Kunugigaoka Junior High School, Class 3-E

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:55.090
And so the curtain fell on one exciting school trip.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.340
Tomorrow, we return to our lives at school...

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.840
in our assassination classroom.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.820

No luck assassinating him on that school trip either, eh?

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.190
Are you sure about this, Karasuma-kun?

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.240
It is all due to my own shortcomings. I shall redouble my efforts.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:53.080
May is almost over. The deadline draws ever closer.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.080
If worst comes to worst, we should just level the whole school with a missile—

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.290
No. The risk is too great.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.510
In any case, he could escape such a blast in the blink of an eye.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:07.380
Remember when we fired at him over the Pacific?

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.600
He put all the fragments back together and delivered them to us personally.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.600
It turned out great!

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.680
Then... is there really no way?

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.310
Not to worry.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:20.810
Several allied nations have pooled their technology for research purposes.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.530
We'll make use of the fruit of their labor.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.240
The Japanese Ministry of Defense has recently authorized...

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.660
two very special assassins to join his class.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.420
They both possess superhuman abilities granted to them by science.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.590
One of them will need some time to work out the kinks,

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.670
but the other has been fully set up while you were away.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.430
There's a real surprise waiting for you back at school,

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.470
Mr. Karasuma.

If you see in person the historic sites and Buddhist statues featured in textbooks,

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.160

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:06.820
Mind your manners as you enjoy the display.
