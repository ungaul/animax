00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.030
We've infiltrated the Fukuma Denjo Hotel to steal a viral remedy from an unidentified bad guy.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.320
We have one hour.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.280
If we don't make it in time, they'll all die!

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.120
You seem pretty average for a pro, huh?

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.460
Breaking glass, busting skulls?

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.080
I can do that much.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.630
But if your opening move is to call in reinforcements,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.300
I guess that means you're too scared to take on a junior-high kid alone.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.010
Very well-eth.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.340
Let's see what you can do-eth.

Too soft-eth. You'll have to find-eth a better weapon.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.590
Don't need one.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.850
Grip strength capable of crushing skulls...

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.100
Once he gets his hands on me, it's game over.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.520
On first glance, this seems like an unwinnable game,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.610
but just switch our positions around,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.280
and it's no different from the unwinnable game we always play.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.950
Wow... He's dodging or blocking every blow!

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.250
That's your defense technique, right, Karasuma-sensei?

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.050
Self-defense is low priority for assassins,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.470
so while I don't remember teaching it in class,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.340
he must have picked it up by watching me dodge their knives.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.980
Akabane Karma... Even in this E Class,

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.240
his talent for fighting is head and shoulders above the rest.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.840
I can dodge him... but if I move in to attack, he'll grab me.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.900
What's wrong-eth?

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.580
You'll never get past me if you don't attack-eth!

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.450
You think?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.290
I mean, I could be doing my best to distract you

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.420
while the rest of us slip past, a few at a time.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.880
But relax.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.670
No underhanded shenanigans here.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.760
Now... it's my turn.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.220
Barehanded, like you.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.890
We'll settle this fair and square, man to man.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.230
I like-eth that face of yours, young warrior.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.860
With you, I've got a chance—

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.150
a chance to have-eth the kind of fair fight I can't experience in the world of assassins.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.080
Now's my chance!

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.670
It's over-eth.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.880
That gas!

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.010
I'm not fond-eth of drawn-out fights.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.640
So I thought I'd give-eth Smog's paralyzing gas a try.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.260
That's dirty!

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.970
Ain't nothin' fair about sneakin' that into the fight!

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.440
I never said that I only fight-eth bare-handed.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.980
One mustn't get-eth too particular about one's hangups.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.440
That's another key to sticking around-eth in this business.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.400
A spray of gas at point-blank range-eth...

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.200
You'll never defend-eth against it if you don't see it com—

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.000
Wh-What have you... hm... Wow, what a coincidence!

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.420
Great minds think alike, huh?

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.680
How.... did you... get-eth... that...

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.600
And how... did you avoid-eth... breathing my gas...

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.230
Eth-eth-eth-eth-eth-eth-eth!

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.020
C'mon, Terasaka, make it snappy!

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.900
We'll need duct tape and sheer numbers to beat this monster!

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.860
Yeah, I'm on it.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.410
That promise of a barehanded one-on-one fight?

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.700
It was bullshit from the word go!

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.040
Careful taping him up.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.630
With his superhuman strength,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.750
you've got to be cautious even when he's paralyzed.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.050
Yes, sir.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.220
Eth-eth-eth-eth-eth-eth-eth-eth...

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.430
I nicked an unused cartridge from that poisoner guy.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.640
Pretty handy. Shame they're one use only.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.540
How-eth... did you see-eth my gas attack coming?

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.860
Is that why you didn't breathe-eth any in?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.610
All I showed-eth you were my bare hands... So how-eth?

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.190
Do I really need to say?

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.070
I was on guard against everything but bare hands.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.910
Hm... I'm sure you really did want a barehanded bout...

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.370
but you would have had to stop us by any means necessary,

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.880
and if I were you, I would've done the same.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.170
I had faith you'd fight like a true pro...

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.720
and that's why I was on guard.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.800
Oh, I get it!

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.970
Karma-kun's changed... for the better.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.140
He had never known true defeat,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.900
but those final exams taught him all too well:

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.360
Losers are people just like you who have their own lives, their own thoughts, and their own worries.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.200
Once you realize that, you inevitably find

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.570
that you can no longer make light of your opponent on the battlefield.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.660
You see that your foe has their own motivations. That they're trying just as hard as you.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.790
And you come to see their abilities. Their circumstances.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.380
Someone who can be respectfully wary of their opponent...

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.170
leaves no openings on the battlefield.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.680
You grew so much from that one defeat.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.680
You'll make a name for yourself someday.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.270
Seems you're a force to be reckoned-eth with, young warrior.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.230
I may have lost, but I enjoyed our time toget—

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.240
What are you talking about?

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.700
The fun's just beginning!

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.160
Eth?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160
What the hell-eth is that?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.450
Wasabi and mustard. I'm gonna put them up your nostrils.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.370
What-eth?!

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.670
I'd been on guard around you all this time,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.250
but now that you're tied up, what's the point?

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:07.840
Eth?

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.800
Once these are in, I'll plug your nose with a special clip,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.510
stuff your mouth with ghost peppers—a thousand times hotter than average chilis—

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:20.020
Be Prepared Be Prepared Be Prepared Be Prepared

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.640
Be Prepared and then I'll gag you. Done and done!

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.140
Be Prepared Be Prepared Be Prepared

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.100
Now, my friend-eth...

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.400
It's time to show-eth me your willpower as a pro.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.520
Korosensei...

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.110
Karma-kun hasn't really changed all that much, has he?

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.160
No, he hasn't. I'm a little worried about his future.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.120
What the hell did you bring with you, anyway?

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.200
Hey, let's get goin'. If we keep draggin' our feet, they'll find us.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.620
They'll find you, you big hulk.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.710
Aw, shut it!

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.880
Okay, everyone, the terrace is upstairs.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.680
The bar floor. Could be tricky.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.340
Yes.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:08.930

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.930
There's a stairway to the VIP floor inside a lounge here.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.260
The back entrance is locked,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.980
so we'll have to come in through the lounge to unlock it.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.940
Now we're flying by the seat of our pants.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.280
We really stand out, though.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.570
Let's have the guys hide here.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.070
We'll sneak into the lounge and unlock the back entrance.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.400
We girls won't look suspicious alone in a place like this.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.210
No. You girls would be in too much danger on your own.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.790
Oh! In that case...

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.500
Huh?

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.030
What beautiful stars!

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.890
Right?

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.250
All thanks to the CEO.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.230
You bet!

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.650
My folks' connections got me a room here.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.740
Got my share of playmates—all with an eye on the family riches.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.660
Lame. What a lame-ass summer vacation.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.880
C'mon, be a man! Now get in front and protect us, Nagisa-kun!

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.430
I can't! I can't be out in front!

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.550
Give it up!

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.510
Go on!

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.680
Why me?

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.550
We'd like a guy around, but in places like this, they check guys real carefully.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.860
Yeah, but even so—

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.400
It's all part of the plan!

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.610
Really?

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.190
Yes, really!

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.110
Not you too!

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.270
You're acting too normal. It's not fresh enough.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.200
But that's not what I'm looking for!

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.540
Where did you find these clothes, anyway?

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.080
Someone left them next to the outdoor pool.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.000
There's a nice one. I totally dig her awkwardness.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.170
Ugh! Let's get out of this filthy place ASAP!

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.590
At least you seem to be enjoying yourself, Fuwa-san.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.340
Hey!

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.390
Where'd you come from?

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.510
How about a drink? Anything you like—

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.430
it's on me!

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.270
Go ahead, Nagisa! Keep him company!

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.690
Huh? But, Kataoka-san...

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.330
We have to act normal, remember?

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.150
We'll come get you if anything happens.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.650
How did it come to this?

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.740
Oh, so you're Nagisa-chan! I'm Yuuji.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.370
Okay! Now's our chance!

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.460
Let's see, the staircase to go up...

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.750
It's got to be this way, right?

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.250
Hey, ladies.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.640
On your own?

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.840
How's about hangin' with us tonight?

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.550
Oh, hell. Will it never end?

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.510
Look, let me tell you something... Yada-san?

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.100
We'd love to hang out with cool guys like you,

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.320
but we're here with our daddies today.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.570
And my daddy's kinda scary.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:57.860
So let's not.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.820
A-A yakuza emblem!

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:07.530
And it's the infamous tiny-but-terrifyin' Shuuei Syndicate!

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.160
I asked real nice and he gave this to me.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.620
Maybe I'll pin it on my schoolbag!

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.310
Sorry about that!

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.620
Wimps. It obviously wasn't mine.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.830
That was amazing, Yada-san!

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.300
C'mon, drink up! I'm paying!

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.760
We're gonna kick it tonight!

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.470
O-Oh, I'm more of a soda gu—er, girl.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.720
I've got to try to act natural until the girls reach their goal.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:34.020
Um, Yuuji-kun? Are you here with your parents?

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.230
My parents?

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.860
Like they have the time!

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:43.030
This is just between us, but my old man, he's a famous TV personality.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.620
You've heard of him, believe me!

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.740
He's such a big deal he can get away with anything.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.710
He was bragging about having squeezed this woman announcer's ass for 24 hours straight.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.250
Does your dad have some kind of grudge against asses or something?

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.220
Dammit! You idiot, Yuuji!

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.180
Can't you hit on someone without leaning on the old man for once?

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.140
Uber-lame... That's... not a regular cigarette, is it?

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.140
It's more dangerous than that.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.790
Yeah. I just got into it.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.230
At my age, if you know about these, you're cool.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:23.570
Our teacher said he doesn't know if smoking those will make you cool,

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.570
but it definitely makes your life harder.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.040
Life's already hard for us men!

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.040
We gotta force ourselves to try to look cool!

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.500
And it's even worse for me 'cos I'm always getting compared to my old man!

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.090
You girls got it made.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.590
All you have to do is pick a cool guy.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.090
Um... yyyeah.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.550
I think the girls in my class have a little more on their minds.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.820
Wow, you borrowed that from Bitch-sensei?

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.020
She's something else. Yakuza, lawyer, racehorse owner...

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.220
She's got every kind of pin you could think of,

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.360
since she can use them for her work.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.920
You're always so interested in Bitch-sensei's work, Yada-san.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.330
Yeah... It's not like I want to seduce people, though.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:16.080
It's like what Korosensei said: you gotta wield a second blade.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.330
I'm betting her intimacy and negotiating skills

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.290
are probably your best bet out in the world.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:25.010
Whoa, Yada-san. You're going to be one kickass grownup!

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.700
Even with those big boobs, I can't help but admire you!

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.600
The big-boob-hating Kayanocchi opens her heart!

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.560
Look, ladies!

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.520
We made it... but there's a lookout.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.440
We might need a man around after all.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.690
Yeah... Kayano-san, go get Nagisa.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:44.360
Okay.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.610
Think we can lure out that lookout and sneak past?

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.070
I'd rather not force our way through.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.910
If we get the better of him, we'll be found out.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.740
Nagisa!

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.500
Kayano!

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.960
Oh, um... I gotta go.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.540
What? Already?

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.550
Bye now!

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.260
Dammit! I can't let her get away without acting my coolest!

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.520
Did you have to leave me alone like that?

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.850
Sorry! We hammered out a strategy.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.930
Great. I can't wait to get out of these clothes.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.640
Hey, wait up, ladies!

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.060
As a special treat, check out my signature dance moves!

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.980
Go away.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.860
I've been doing this ever since I was a kid.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.490
These moves always get me the girl!

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.110
Huh?

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.160
Hey, brat! Tough guy, eh?

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.440
N-No... I—

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.370
Get over here!

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.140
I didn't mean to—

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.000
This is a million-yen jacket. I demand compensation!

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.170
Your address, now!

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.210
Hinata-chan!

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.670
Add on pain and suffering, and that's three million total.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.390
Pay up and we'll only leave you half dead!

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.680
What?! M-My father will pay! Please don't beat me up!

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.270
Excuse me, Mr. Yakuza, sir?

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:00.930
Yeah?

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.120
Excuse me, sir?

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.720
One of the patrons just suddenly collapsed.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.410
You'd better get him out of harm's way and have him looked at.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.120
Y-Yes, ma'am. Sorry for the bother.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.210
What'd he do, overdose? Sheesh.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.630
Now!

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.540
Back to the dance floor with you!

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.840
And don't tell anyone about this, okay?

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.310
Even when girls pull off something cool so effortlessly,

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.430
you still have to chin up and act cool yourself.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.270
It is hard, being a guy.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.640
Nagisa-chan...

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.980
If we meet again, keep acting cool, okay?

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.550
Though cut out the drugs and dancing if you can help it.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.910
Here we are!

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.160
We really sent you into some dicey territory.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.410
You weren't in any danger, were you?

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.560
Nuh-uh!

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.830
Not remotely!

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.710
Wow, you sure changed fast, Nagisa.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:09.460
Yeah.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.460
Hmm? What's wrong?

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.300
It's just...

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.180
You girls did everything this time around.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.760
What was even the point of me being in this getup?

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.760
Comic relief, duh!

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.350
Don't you dare, Karma-kun!

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.120
No, I don't think that's it.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.470
I'm sure it wound up helping someone.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.860
If only you could have stayed like that.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.740
History's full of assassins who disguised themselves as women, after all.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.040
Don't you start too, Isogai-kun!

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.040
If you're gonna cut it off, Nagisa-kun, sooner is better.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.130
I am not! I happen to like it!

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.210
Can we talk about this later?

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.880
Or never.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.260
We're in our final stage of infiltration here.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.220
Ritsu?
Yes, sir.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.300
Up ahead is the VIP floor.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.510
These guests don't rely solely on hotel security

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.390
but provide their own hired lookouts.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.730
So of course there's some blocking the staircase.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.360
They look way tough, too.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.070
Are they more of the guys who've been threatening us?

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.190
Or are they hired muscle that has nothing to do with us?

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:20.010
Either way, we're gonna have to beat 'em to get by.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.120
That's exactly right, Terasaka-kun.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.830
And that weapon you have will do the job perfectly.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.290
Pff! What, you got X-ray vision now, too?

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.030
You'll have to take them both down at the same time, or they'll call for help.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.800
I got this, okay?

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.340
Hey, Kimura, see if you can lure 'em out this way some.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.390
Who, me?

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.550
But how?

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.350
How should I know?

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.430
Here, Kimura, try this...

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.170
What gives, kid?

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.690
Huh? Any brains around here?

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.860
These guys are total muscleheads!

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.070
You slabs of pigmeat oughta quit pretending to be human.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.030
Hey!
Get back here!

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.290
Yep, that pissed 'em off!

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.040
What's with this brat?

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.000
He's crazy fast!

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.830
Okay! Now!

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.380
Got it!

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.250
S-Stun-guns?

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.390
I bought 'em to see how electricity worked on that octopus.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.510
Never thought I'd be usin' 'em like this!

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.470
You bought those? Weren't they expensive?

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.640
Huh? Uh, well...

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.140
I came into a little money lately, so...

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.980
These two... They look...

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.900
Nice weapon, Terasaka-kun.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.440
But check their chests.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.410
Huh?

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.950
Judging from the bulges there,

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.870
you ought to be able to find something even better.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.370
R-Real guns!

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:50.160
And...

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.640
Chiba-kun? Hayami-san?

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.840
Those guns are for you.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.920
Karasuma-sensei hasn't recovered enough to fire with any accuracy.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.260
Right now, you two are the best gun-users we have.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.010
B-But this is all so sudden.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.970
However!

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.810
No Killing I will not permit you to kill anyone.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:17.260
With your skill, you should have plenty of ways to use those to defeat someone without a scratch.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.990
Giving us real guns?

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.070
When we couldn't even pull off our mission with airguns?

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.580
Let's be on our way, then.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.370
From the looks of things at this hotel,

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.580
there's no sign the enemy has set up camp in any great numbers.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.290
They're probably down to one or two hired killers—at most.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.300
Yeah! So let's go murdalize the rest!

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:45.440
Okay, team: we'll have to use the VIP-only emergency stairs to reach the next floor up.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.640
And to do that, we'll have to go through the concert hall on the 8th floor.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.690
This is starting to leave a bad taste in my mouth.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.610
I was charged with killing some super-creature,

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.240
so how'd I get stuck going to meet a bunch of kids?

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.780
Revolting.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.760
Sure enough, the only thing tasty around here...

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.990
is my gun.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:37.930

Nagisa-kun, humans have chromosomes called X and Y.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.340
X and Y make you a male, while two X's make you a female.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.120
A child gets an X from their mother and either an X or a Y from their father.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.280
In other words, the child's sex depends on what they get from their father.
