00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.520
Thanks. I really appreciate the help.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.110
Even with all your tentacles, you can't carry all the lab equipment at once!

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.030
But with your help, we can still do it in one trip.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.450
You're as dependable as I'd expect from class officers.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.530
You could've done it in multiple Mach-speed trips just as easily, though.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.960
No, no. A few helping hands makes it all the merrier.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.540
Tell me, Sensei.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.500
Yes?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.170
Do you feel at home in E Class now?

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.630
I can't believe you actually asked him!

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.180
Yes. I very much enjoy being your teacher.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.930
That's weird.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.060
Is it?

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.900
Of course it is!

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.480
Who would've thought a weird octopus thing could be a teacher?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.400
Guess it's just a matter of getting used to it, though.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.940
He actually teaches us. I'd say that makes him more or less acceptable.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.280
I guess so.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.910
Even if he is an assassination target.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.820
That's a vital detail!

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.830
Don't forget it, all right?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.050
He seriously prepared the lab while dodging three knives at once?

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.630
You okay, Maehara?

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.510
Y-Yeah.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.720
You know a sneak attack that simple just isn't gonna cut it.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.470

Umm...

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.620

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.380
W-Well, umm...

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.550
I'm not good at surprise attacks and stuff like everyone else.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.470
But I am good at chemistry,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.680
so I put my heart and soul into this!

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.480
Heart and soul?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.060
O-Okuda...

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.440
No one would be dumb enough to drink it just like that.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.610
Well, then!

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.030
I would be delighted to!

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.650
No way!

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.690
He drank it!

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.860

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.790
Is it working?!

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.870
Is this for real?!

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.500
He, uh, grew horns.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.460
Ah, yes. This tastes like sodium hydroxide.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.000
It's poisonous to humans, but not to me, I'm afraid.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.510
Oh... There are two others, correct?

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.720
Y-Yes!

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.850
Well, without further ado...

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.880
This time he grew wings!

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.340
His face is getting pretty tricked out!

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.560
Ah, thallium acetate.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.780
Now for the last one!

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.950
What's going to happen?!

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.660
What'll this one do?

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.090
His face turned blank.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.620
These changes are just too unpredictable!

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.260
Aqua regia, I see.
It doesn't get any blanker than that!

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.430
The only effect they have is on my face.
He's like a living emoticon!

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.940
Even if you come to hate me, please don't hate assassination.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.430
What brought that on?!

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.200
Also, Okuda-san.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.860
I can't allow my students to make poison unsupervised. It's not safe.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.860
I understand. Sorry.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.860
If you have some time later on...

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.570
why don't we work together on a poison that'll really kill me?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.620
O-Okay!

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.030
Making poison with the target?

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.710
I'll have to ask her what it ends up being.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.210
All right!

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.460
Here it comes!

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.290
Hurry!

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.710
All right!
Got it!

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.420
Heads up!

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.420
Score!

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.680
Say, Karasuma...

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.430
It's awful hot today.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.100
Don't you think so, Karasuma?

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.980
If you're feeling hot, give yourself some space.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.540
I'm not your target. Quit fooling around.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.650
What a stick in the mud.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.160
If you hope to remain here as a teacher, I suggest you pull yourself together.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.200
It's so humid and sticky here. It's disgusting.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.870
Why doesn't this campus have any air conditioning?

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.400
I've asked the school to improve these facilities, but they refuse.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.960
Huh?

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.460
Damn!

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.710
Nice! That was a clean hit!

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.470
That's just the type of place this is.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.220
Now, let's add it to the ethanol.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.350
Oh, and be careful not to inhale the fumes.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.970
Okay!

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.730
Your grades in science are superb, but...

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.770
But everything else goes right over my head.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.480
It's only natural that I ended up in E Class.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.990
Japanese class, especially.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:17.750
I never know the right way to phrase things or how to express my feelings as a person.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.280
But I'm okay with that.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.480
Because equations and formulas always have a right answer.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:35.680
They're free of fussy word games and complicated emotions.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.930
That's true.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.560
In that case... I have a homework assignment for you.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.020
Handle it with the utmost of care!

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.950
So he told you to bring that poison to class?

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.950
Yeah!

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.040
He said this one should theoretically work the best!

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.950
He even drew a comic describing how to store poison correctly.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.590
He's always ready to lend a hand.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.460
A poison that'll kill him?

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:06.670
Step 2.
Add rat snake fangs and bat wings to (1).
Heat the mixture until you see a color change, then pass it through a filter.
Upon use, make a four- to five-fold dilution in ethanol.
Add some sugar to finish it off if you prefer. (Do not taste it!)
Key Point Make sure to pre-wet your
filter paper with the solvent.
Proper Storage of Poisonous Substances
Keep it away from direct sunlight.
Don't mix with water.
Don't add sugar past midnight.
Follow the guidelines and enjoy your assassination!
I'm glad I stored my poison properly!
If only I'd stored it correctly back then!
No... Let's break up. You're too dangerous.
I also made 5 girlfriends
Since then, I got into a top university

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.970
What's he thinking?

Key Point Let's break up. You're too dangerous.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.680
I'm guessing it's his way of encouraging me.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.850
I think he wants me to hone my strengths, even if I'm not good with words!

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.230
Okay, everyone!

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.310
Oh, he's here! Go give it to him!
Please be seated!

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.480
Here it is, Sensei.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.480
Wonderful!

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.820
Well then, down the hatch!

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.400
Thank you, Okuda-san.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.230
Huh?

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:49.090
With your concoction, I can advance to a new state of being.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.020
What... do you mean?

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.470
Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew

00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.720
Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.220
He melted?!

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:09.150
I actually had you produce a tonic that would stimulate my cells and enhance my fluidity.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.700
As a liquid, I can now fit into the tightest of spaces.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.990
Um, why are you in there?

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.280
What's more, I'm still as speedy as ever!

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.450
Go ahead! Just try and kill me!

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.950
This is one messed-up teacher!

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.950
What was that poison, Okuda-san?!

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.790
Y-You tricked me, Korosensei!

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.050
Having the verbal aptitude to deceive others is a vital part of assassination, Okuda-san.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.510
Huh?

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.920
Verbal aptitude?

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.090
Even the most potent of poisons is wasted

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:43.810
if you offer it in such a naïve way that your target can take advantage of you.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:48.100
Nagisa-kun, how would you try to poison me?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.560
Huh? Hmm...

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.570
I'd probably mix it into a sweet drink you like...

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.310
For you!
Thanks!

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.070
...and then offer it to you as a special drink I made.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.170
Very good.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.240
To deceive someone, you must understand their feelings

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.830
and tailor your words accordingly.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.790
Language is the key to an effective poisoning.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.150
I'm sure that one day, your scientific talents will benefit many.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.260
You'll need to explain things clearly to as many people as possible.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.930
So by developing your language skills to kill me, you can poison two birds with one vial.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.390
I-I will!

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.270
We've got a lot more to think about than assassination, it seems.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:37.780
Even a student brandishing a deadly poison is powerless in the face of Korosensei.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.100
I guess taking our teacher's life is still a distant dream for us all.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.800
Hurry!

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.520
If we're late, who knows what they'll do to us this time!

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.760
Oh, yeah. We've already had to clean out the main campus' flowerbeds.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.480
Man, that was rough. Their flowerbeds are way too huge.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.980
I don't wanna hear that after you slacked off the whole time!

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.940
Did I?

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:20.740
Damn it! Why are we the only ones who have to put up with this?

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.240

Sir, yes, Sir! Yay!

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.510
Boulders!

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.890
O-Okajima!

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.270
Who poked that beehive?!

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.150
O-Okajima!

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.910
He's... sure been through a lot.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.650
I hope he'll be okay.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.530
Yeah.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.620
For crying out loud! Enough with the bees and everything!

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.540
Luckily, Okajima took a few for the team.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.350
Are you all right?

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.930
Karasuma-sensei!

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:57.750
There's no rush. If we keep this pace, we'll have time to spare.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.800
Hold on,

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.010
you brats!

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.380
Oh! Bitch-sensei!

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.260
No one told me anything about a class trip during lunch break!

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.500
Wow, you're a real mess, Bitch-sensei.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.520
Do you know how exhausting it is to run in heels?!

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.230
Karasuma-sensei.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.400
Where's Korosensei?

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.400
We can't risk the other students seeing him,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.650
so I had him wait at the old campus.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.860
I'm an outcast, all alone... Shunned Sensei...

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.980
It's not much farther to the main campus. Let's go.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.160
Okay... Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.250
Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal Goal

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.250
Goal

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.260
Th-That freakin' killed me.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.190
We made it.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.800
Yeah, somehow.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.350
Come on, guys! Let's hurry and line up!

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.760
Okay...

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.520
Yeah, yeah...

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.530
Nagisa-kun!

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.390
So glad you could make it!

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.610
Must've been tough comin' down the mountain, I'm sure!

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.620
There's an all-school assembly once a month.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.460
Even here, E Class gets "special" treatment.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.170
And all we can do is grin and bear it.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:28.010
In short, you are the cream of the crop— this nation's chosen elite!

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.920
I, your school dean, can vouch for that!

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.510
But if you're not careful...

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.890
you could wind up as worthless as you-know-who!

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.560
Now, now. We mustn't laugh at their expense.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.880
Hey, Nagisa. Where's Karma?
I suppose my comment was out of line.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.900
Playing hooky.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.530
What?!

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.570
Just him?!

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:53.780
He knows he'll get punished for skipping assembly, but he says he doesn't care.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.000
It's times like this I wish I were an honor student bad-boy.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.290
I hear ya.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.210
This method is always so effective, sir!

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.140
Thanks to it, our students' acceptance rate into top universities—

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.300
3-E aside—is extremely high!

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.080
This is preparation for the real world, so to speak.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.020
Now is our chance to instill in them the desire to avoid failure.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:27.780
It's unfortunate, but people develop the most when they have someone to look down upon.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.490
That makes sense!

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.170
I always act based on reason.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.600
In administration and assassination alike,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.580
adhering to logic is all that matters.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.370
Next, we'll have an address by the student council.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.650
Please have the speakers begin their preparations.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.130
Hello. I'm Karasuma, the E Class teacher.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.670
Who's that teacher?

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.920
He's so stylish and cool!

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.170
As I work on a separate campus, I thought I'd use this opportunity to say hello.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.170
Uh... Okay!

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.300
Hey!

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.090
Check it out!

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.680
Oh!

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.910
Oh, Karasuma-sensei!

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.100
We decorated our knife sheaths!

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.180
Cute, huh!

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.390
Cuteness is all well and good, but don't pull them out in public!

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:06.440
We absolutely cannot let the other classes find out about the assassination!

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.940
O-Okay... Who's that guy? An E Class teacher?

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.230
They seem to get along pretty well.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.430
I'm kinda jealous.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.740
All the guys and teachers in our class are butt-ugly.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.050
Wh-Who's that hot-ass white chick?!

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.890
Bitch-sensei was ready to drop just a minute ago, too.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.060
W-Wait for me!

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.060
Vanity's in her veins, all right.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.260
Is she an E Class teacher too?

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.320
That's kinda cool.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.530
What are you doing here?

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.160
Don't give me that. I'm their teacher too.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.030
So you do consider yourself a teacher?

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.200
Plus, I wanted to check out the other students.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.080
Hardly worth the trip.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.580
Oh, yeah.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.870
Nagisa.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.090
Now that we've ditched that octopus, I thought I'd ask you something.

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:17.240
You've been keeping track of all of his weaknesses, right?

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.180
Let me borrow your notebook.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.460
What? I already told you all of the ones that matter.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.110
Oh, come on. You're just trying to hide the juicy stuff!

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.480
No, I'm serious—

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.110
Come on! Give it to me, kid!

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.990
Don't make me smother you!

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.110
I can't breathe! Your boobs are too much, Bitch-sensei!

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.570
God damn, I wish that was me.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.870
That's one hot bitch.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.620
What the hell?

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.130
The End Class isn't supposed to have fun!
Ow! That hurts!

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.790
Attention, please.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.960
The student council events are explained on the handouts you've just been given.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.050
Huh? What?

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.550
Where are ours?

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.600
June Events School Survey Sports Tournament
Physical Fitness Test
Excuse me, sir! E Class didn't get any handouts!

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.600
Oh?

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.440
You didn't get any? How strange.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.860
I'm sorry! Seems like we forgot to make enough copies for you!

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.150
I guess you'll just have to memorize the whole thing before you leave!

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.510
But hey, you and your classmates could stand to sharpen your memorization skills, right?

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.990
What the hell? Could he be any more sadistic?

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.790
Isogai-kun.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.590
What are you... Oh, there we go!

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.670
Now, does everyone have a handwritten copy?

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.680
Student Council Newsletter Yes, sir!

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.080
Oh, we got our handouts! Please continue!

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.680
What? N-No way! How?!

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.930
Hey, now! Who killed our fun?!

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.190
Er, um, ahem... Let us continue!

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.440
We'll take a look at the upcoming student council schedule.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.400
The student council...

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.300
I explicitly told you not to show yourself to the rest of the school!

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.890
Your very existence is a state secret, you know!

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.090
Oh, come on. My disguise is flawless.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.700
No one will ever know.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.010
He must've gotten lonely.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.830
Can't blame him, I guess.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.440
Whoa, where did that teacher come from?

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.470
He seems kind of big. And... floppy.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.590
And that other teacher's attacking him all of a sudden.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.260
Is she trying to stab him?

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.100
Ow! That hurts!

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.680
Now she's being taken away.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.680
I don't get it.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.230
That's Bitch-sensei for you!

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.360
We're going on ahead, Nagisa!

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.950
Okay! I'll catch up after I buy something to drink!

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:45.990
Hey. Nagisa.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.710
Don't you think you guys are gettin' a bit too big for your britches?

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:51.370
Huh?

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.720
Laughin' during the assembly and stuff...

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.420
How about learning some respect?

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.360
You E-Class losers should just keep your heads down where they belong.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.930
What with your crappy lives weighin' you down and all.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.430
Hey. What's with that dirty look?

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.390
This damn school...

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.940
None of the students trying to assassinate me...

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.340
would ever let people like that get the better of them.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.860
You dumb in more ways than one? Say something!

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.950
Or d'you want me to kill you?!

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.450
Kill?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.450
Kill...

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.170
"Kill," huh?

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.280
Like you've ever tried to kill someone before.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.190
Wh-What was that look?

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.000
It was bloodlust.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.400
See? My students are much more... motivated.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.950
E Class...

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.990
The End Class is shoving aside anyone who gets in their way.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.160
But that's not how we do things. Not at my school.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.790
It seems I'll have to make a few changes.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.080
The assassination can wait.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.300
This is my top priority now.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:37.850
