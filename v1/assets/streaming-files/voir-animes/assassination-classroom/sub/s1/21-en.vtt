00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.360
I can only see a few of the students from this angle.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.410
Gotta love the face of a junior-high student in pain.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.950
Once I get that ten billion yen,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.830
I might just buy a bunch of 'em and force-feed 'em that virus every day.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.460
Fourteen—no, fifteen of them.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.900
Judging by their breathing, they're young, mostly in their mid-teens.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.780
Who'da thunk it?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.110
Everyone who's still up and about made it here.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.660
Just so you know, this hall is completely soundproof.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.980
I'll fill you all with lead before anyone comes to save you.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.540
You know that none of you have the guts to take a life.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.710
Now come on out like good little children and bow before the boss—

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.970
Missed! And I was aiming for the gun!

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.280
Live ammo? And from the sounds of it...

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.680
Did they take our goons' Model 60s?!

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.200
Junior-high kids trained for assassination...

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.600
Excellent.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.990
Looks like this might actually be a job I can sink my teeth into!

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.610

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.920
S-So bright!

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.250
Can't see the stage with that backlight!

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.340
Feelin' fine again today, with my tasty, tasty gun!

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.050
H-He fired through that tiny gap?

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.510
I never forget the position of any enemy once they've fired.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.560
I used to be in the military, you see.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.270
My time there gave me a knack for pinpointing my enemies' locations,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.520
and having to identify guns with my tongue gave me a real taste for weaponry.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.740
Now, then... There should be one more stolen gun out there.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.990
Hayami-san! Remain standing by!

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.200
You were wise not to fire just now, Chiba-kun!

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.540
The enemy still doesn't know where you are!

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.830
I'll keep an eye on him and tell you when,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.170
so hang tight until it's go time!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.670
Where's that coming from?

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.300
Hey! Quit starin' at me from the front row!

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.760
An expert gunman versus junior-high students?

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.140
I think it's fair for them to have a slight handicap.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.100
Okay, Kimura-kun, run five seats left!

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.320
Terasaka-kun and Yoshida-kun, move three seats to either side!

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.570
We've formed a blind spot!

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.740
Kayano-san, use this chance to move two rows forward!

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.070
Karma-kun and Fuwa-san, move eight seats right!

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.740
Isogai-kun! Five seats left!

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.450
H-He's shuffling them around?

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.620
Bastard's making it complicated!

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.660
And yet,

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.830
he's telling me their names and positions with every command.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.710
I'll have 'em memorized in no time.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.920
Student number 12!

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.550
Move right and continue preparations!

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.880
Numbers 4 and 6, film the target from between the seats!

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.510
Use Ritsu-san to tell Chiba-kun what's happening onstage!

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.760
Ponytail, move to the front-left!

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.140
Motorcycle Fan, you too! Two seats to the front-left!

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.230
The person who visited Takebayashi-kun's favorite maid café out of curiosity and was alarmed to find he liked it,

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.150
make a big racket to confuse the enemy!

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.360
Shaddup! How the hell did you know that?!

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.320
Now I have no idea where anyone is!

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.030
Okay, Chiba-kun, it's time.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.740
After I give this next command, fire at will.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.200
Argh! Where are you, dammit?!

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.080
Hayami-san, support him as the situation requires.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.630
You're looking to block off the enemy's movements.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.390
But before that, a word of advice for the two who don't let their feelings show:

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.390
When you failed to shoot me down earlier today,

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.350
you began to doubt your own skill.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.180
You don't whine or make excuses,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.520
and your classmates forced their confidence onto you,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.650
thinking, "Surely they can handle it."

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.440
No one would notice your anguish.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.780
You seem pretty relaxed for someone with such bad grades!

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.910
I should never have trusted you to study on your own!

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.980
He won't even make any excuses.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.250
I have no idea what he's thinking!

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.330
But it's all right.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.380
You don't have to bear all that pressure alone.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.470
If you two miss, we'll switch to plan B: shuffling people and guns around

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.720
so no one can tell who's pulling the trigger.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.930
We can use that strategy because everyone here has gone through training and tasted failure.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.190
You have allies at your side who have shared your experience.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.730
So with that peace of mind, go ahead and fire.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.240
Heh. Thanks for that.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.200
That little pep talk of yours gave me enough time to figure this out.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.910
Student number 12 is the only one who hasn't moved.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.280
And yet they're breathing heavily, like they're planning something.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.450
The second someone pops up in that area, I'll shoot to kill.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.340
All right, here we go!

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.760
It tastes divine!

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.640
Right now I'm one with my gun...

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.060
and I don't plan on missing!

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.480
Student number 12! Stand and fire!

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.020
Bingo!

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.690
A dummy?!

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.320
That's where you need to aim!

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.070
Okay.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.910
You missed. Now I know where the second one—

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.130
Th-They aimed for the brackets... on the stage lights?

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.300
Damn it all!

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.720
Phew. Finally hit the mark.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.640
All right, tape him up!

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.400
Building a dummy in complete silence takes a lot out of you!

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.270
That was a real white-knuckle moment.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.190
I'm amazed you let them handle such a dangerous fight.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:56.030
Every human being has a number of opportunities to break out of their shell and grow.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.030
But they can't make the most of those opportunities on their own.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.290
Nice work!

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.710
They need tough foes who call on their powers of concentration

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.380
and allies with whom to share their experiences.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.760
And so, I want to be a teacher who can provide these things.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:16.720
To give my students high walls and good friends without losing sight of their moments of growth.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.260
What an education.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.230
They've just had a shoot-out with their lives on the line,

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.940
and yet their expressions look more like junior-high students' now.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.740
Seems like I'm back in action.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.210
Though I'd say I'm at about half strength.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.080
That's still twice as strong as us.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.040
He should have just gone in alone.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.090
So that leads to the top floor.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.010
Yeah.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.830
We're out of time.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.470
Students!

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.280
I've come to realize something about our mastermind waiting above.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.310
He's using assassins all wrong.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.320
What?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.630
Lookout and guards... Those aren't jobs for assassins.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.780
If their potential had been used to the fullest, they'd have been fearsome indeed.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.280
Yeah, the gunman's shot wasn't even a single centimeter off the mark.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.210
And, Karma-kun: if that fellow had snuck up on you from behind on any other day,

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.020
he would have killed you instantly through sheer grip strength.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.380
I suppose so.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.590
So it's true.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.360
Our mastermind isn't an assassin after all.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.010
Time to assign roles to each of you.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.930
First off... Isogai-kun, Terasaka-kun, Yoshida-kun:

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.350
Nagisa?

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.060
I'd like you three to...

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.760
You're burning up, Terasaka-kun. Are you... infec—

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.210
Keep it down!

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.420
I always got stamina to spare.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.900
It'll go away by itself in no time!

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.950
That's crazy talk!

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:57.320
That damn Karasuma only got gassed 'cause I had to go and run ahead when I did.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.530
And that's not the first time my actions almost got everyone killed.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.980
I ain't about to drop out now and drag everyone down even more!

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.460
Terasaka-kun... Commence operation!

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.140
C'mon!

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.870
Ooh, Namba!

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.350
They say ninjas used this walking style.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:37.690
No wonder there've been so many more silent assassinations in our classroom lately.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:42.370
Even as their time runs out, they refuse to panic or lose hope.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.620
I'm so proud of these students of mine.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:49.690
All the more reason we mustn't give in to the enemy before us.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.130
I'm betting that's the viral remedy.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.840
And those wires...

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.710
They lead to a plastic explosive.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.220
We're right on time.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.890
Ideally, we'll be able to subdue him.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.680
If he sees us, I'll shoot his arm.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.350
He won't be able to push that detonator...

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.810
and that's when we all rush in and grab them!

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.610
Now!

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:20.820
Itchy.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.740
The very memory makes me itch.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.540
But maybe that's why my senses have grown so much keener—

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.380
because my wounds are always exposed to the air.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:42.480
Didn't I tell you? I've come prepared to kill a Mach-20 monster.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.890
I brought spare detonator remotes in case one was snatched away at high speed.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:51.080
I have more than enough to press any one of them if I should fall.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.520
We'd heard that voice before...

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.770
but this time, it was far more sinister.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:03.020
Of the people I couldn't reach, there were three assassins and one other.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:08.160
An insider who vanished with Ministry of Defense secret-service funds and the assassination budget.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.500
What do you think you're doing, Takaoka?

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.130

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.470
What naughty children.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.590
Slipping in through the back door to see your dear teacher?

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.260
That's not how your good old dad raised you.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.100
Ah, well. I'll have to give you some summertime tutoring.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.770
Takaoka... sensei...

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.400
Shall we take this to the roof?

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.140
I've got everything ready to welcome my beloved students.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.830
You'll follow me up there, right?

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:52.790
After all, your class is only alive thanks to my benevolence.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.680
Hiring assassins, threatening students with a virus...

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.720
Have you gone mad?

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.120
Now, now. I am exceedingly sane!

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.060
This plan of mine will save the world!

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.810
If only you'd sent those two littl'uns along to bring me the one with the bounty,

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.570
my assassination plan would've gone off without a hitch.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:30.580
See, my plan would've used, what was her name, Kayano? The girl.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:35.290
The bathtub in my room here is filled with anti-teacher BBs.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.960
I'd have her go in there while holding the target,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.350
and then I'd bury them alive in cement.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:46.260
For him to return to his usual form without touching those BBs,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.470
he would have to blow the lot to smithereens—including his student.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:55.360
But he cares far too much for his dear students to do anything so heartless!

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.020
So I figure he'd just do me a favor and melt away without a fight.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.820
He's... He's a demon!

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.990
It gave me a fright when I learned you all came here together,

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.450
but it doesn't much change what I have to do.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:17.530
My mood will determine how many of you leave here alive.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.630
Do you think you can get away with this?

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:30.720
Oh, I'd say it's far more humane than how you've treated me!

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.780
Takaoka lost to a junior-high kid and totally blew his mission!

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.400
Whoa! And after all that bragging about his teaching skills?

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.460
His bosses mustn't think much of him now!

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:50.800
Their humiliating glances, and that trick you pulled on me with a knife...

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:56.920
Whenever they cross my mind, my face gets so itchy I can't even sleep at night!

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.760
I'll pay back my failure with results.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.960
I'll take the humiliation I suffered and give it back in spades!

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.560
And you're first on my list, Shiota Nagisa!

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.220
I will never forgive you for spoiling my future!

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.080
So when he asked for the shortest students, he was after Nagisa.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.260
A completely unjustified grudge!

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:20.890
Oh? So you wanted Nagisa-kun here so you could settle the score?

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.650
Would it make you happy, beating someone so much smaller than you?

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.440
I could show you a much better time.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:33.410
You're nuts. You only lost to Nagisa according to your own damn rules!

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.660
Listen, whether you'd won or lost back then,

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.250
we'd still hate your guts!

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.240
I don't recall asking you little shits for your opinions!

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.130
Don't forget I could blow away half of you with one finger!

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.170
You. Shrimp.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.090
Come upstairs alone.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.810
To the heliport.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.970
Nagisa, you can't!

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.810
I don't want to...

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.560
but I will.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.900
Get a move on! Now!

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.690
He's so agitated that who knows what he'll do.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.130
I'll hear him out, talk him down,

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.110
and get him to hand over the remedy in one piece.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.370
Nagisa-kun...

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.490
Nagisa...

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:49.820
Takaoka!

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.780
Now, now, don't take this the wrong way.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:58.740
I just don't want you interrupting my precious time with Shiota Nagisa-kun.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.430
There. Now no one else can come up here.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.680
Do you understand what I'm trying to do?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.270
This is a rematch of our earlier fight.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.030
Wait, Takaoka-sensei.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.720
I didn't come here to fight.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.110
I'm sure.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.820
Those cheap tricks of yours won't work anymore.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.950
I can see myself doing you in, just like that.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.360
But if I do, it'll be over too quickly to make me feel better.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.460
So before we fight, there's something I need you to do.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.090
Apologize. On your hands and knees.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.760
Atone wholeheartedly for having pulled a dirty sneak attack

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.980
because you lack any real skill.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.100
I—

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.150
That doesn't look like hands and knees to me, you goddamned brat!

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.860
I wanna see your head on the ground, boy!

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:31.000
I have no real skill, so I pulled a dirty sneak attack. I'm sorry.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:40.300
Oh, and after that you talked real big to me. Told me to get out, as I recall.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.770
Is that any way for a brat like you to talk to an adult?

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.480
Is that any way for a student to talk to his teacher?!

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.560
I'm just a brat and a student,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.860
and it was wrong for me to talk back to an adult—a teacher.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.010
I'm very sorry.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.240
Now you're speaking from the heart.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.580
Your dear dad is so pleased!

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.120
I'll let you in on a little something in return.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.590
I asked Smog what happens to people who die from that virus.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.560
He showed me some pictures. What a laugh!

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.560
Their bodies, covered in boils!

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.190
Faces like bunches of grapes!

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.430
Wouldn't you like to see that, Nagisa-kun?

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.520
No!

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.010
Yes!

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.070
That's the face I wanted to see!

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.970
You ought to keep a summer journal, like you'd do for plants,

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:12.190
and write down every detail as your friends' faces bubble in agony!

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.360
I'll... kill you...

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.620
That's right.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.330
That's the way.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.920
Oh dear... I'll...

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.420
I'll kill you!
