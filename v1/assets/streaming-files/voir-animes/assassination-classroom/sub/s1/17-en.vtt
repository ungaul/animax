Whoa, just look at 'em all!

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.920
Summer vacation had begun...

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.610
and with it came our freedom!

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.830
Or so you'd think.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.600
Why are we here at school?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.800
Well... I don't want people to see me out catching bugs at my age.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.240
But I've always wanted to do this, and I never got a chance in the city.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.310
Plus, Karma happened to point me to a tree with some good bugs on it.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.010
Though I didn't expect you to come, Maehara.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.270
Never pegged you as an insect fan.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.150
Our next assassination's at that island resort, right?

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.160
Wouldn't you say we're missing a little something?

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.110
Like what?

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.570
Money!

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.990
You need buying power if you're gonna snag yourself a swimsuited babe!

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.250
That runt won't do the trick, but a giant stag beetle?

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.540
Those babies'll net you tens of thousands of yen!

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.280
Auction 'em off online for major cashola,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.550
and we'll make at least enough to cover a fancy dinner and a place to chill out!

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.160
I think he's forgotten what this trip's all about.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.970
Yeah. That wasn't your average fifteen-year-old's vacation plans.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.510
That won't work!

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.140
Giant stag beetles're old and busted.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.980
Kurahashi!

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.230
Morning! You're here to scrape up some spending money too, huh?

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.650
Hey, what do you mean, stag beetles are old and busted?

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.440
Well...

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.740
I guess they were super valuable right around when we were born,

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.100
but today's artificial breeding methods have saturated the market,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.910
bringing their prices way down.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.930
You mean the beetle bubble burst?!

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.150
I figured one beetle would make around enough to cover one babe...

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.010
No way. These days, babes are way more expensive.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.490
You sure know a lot about this, Kurahashi. Are you into bugs?

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.300
Yep! Along with every other living thing!

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.000
Hey, since we're all here... Let's all go bug-hunting!

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.060
We're bound to find tons if we all try!

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.020
The innocent and genuine Kurahashi-san

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.560
knows an insane amount about living creatures.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.280
Just the right helping hand for a bunch of crass-ish guys to have around.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.670
Mmm. Pretty nice haul.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.740
Whoa! Did you set this?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.200
It's a home-made trap of mine.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.460
I put it out last night.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.460
Let ferment for 1-2 days
There are about twenty more of them out there,

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.930
so that's about a thousand yen for each of us if we're lucky!

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.640
Not too shabby for a side job!

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.100
I hope we caught the one I was looking for!

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.370
What an inefficient trap.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.470
And you call yourselves the E Class?

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.890
Okajima!

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.980
Pulling in a measly thousand yen at a time? Yeah, right.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.690
My trap'll bring in a cool ten billion!

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.480
Ten billion... You don't mean—

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.040
Oh, but I do.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.420
If we're planning an assassination on this tropical isle,

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.910
that octopus is bound to let his guard down in the meantime.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.290
And that's what I'm after!

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.210
Stag Stag Stag Stag Stag

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.210
Stag All right! Here we go!

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.460
He went right for my porno trap!

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.610
Wow. When do you see the speedy Korosensei too absorbed in reading to make the slightest movement?

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.050
That one must be right up his alley.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.150
And what's with the stag beetle getup?

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.520
Is he trying to blend in? That's just sad.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.480
Every mountain has one: the smut stash.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.690
The kids who find their dreams there grow old enough to buy their own porn mags

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.860
and then leave behind dreams for someone else to find.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.450
Please dispose of recyclables responsibly as per your local council's arrangements.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.450
It's a place filled with neverending dreams.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.450
I'm glad you're here! Lend me a hand!

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.200
We'll use our porn power to give him a dream he'll never wake up from!

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.500
We seem to have reached maximum crassitude.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.850
I did some major research into his top turn-ons, y'know.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.710
Can't buy the stuff myself, but I found a few.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.120
Wouldn't he like anything with big boobs?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.840
In real life, sure.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.850
A hit But dirty magazines are dreams.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.600
Everyone looks for their ideal in those pages.
A miss.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.150
For photos and manga alike, the tiniest difference gets a whole 'nother response.
Photos a hit, setup doesn't sit well

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.980
That's amazing, Okajima-kun. So for the last month,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.030
you've been placing different kinds of porn and carefully observing his reactions?

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.990
What kind of grown-up would spend a whole month picking up abandoned porn mags?

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.200
That's just sad.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.030
It's just like your traps, Kurahashi.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.410
You need to work out ways to attract your prey for long periods of time, right?

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.290
Yeah.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.040
I've got a dirty mind.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.250
If you wanna hate me for it, go on ahead.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.500
But it's only because I'm a super-lech that I know:

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.340
Pornography can save the world.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.550
How did he make that sound so cool?!

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.100
I'll get him, all right!

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.930
Under all that porn is a net strung with anti-teacher BB pellets!

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.400
He's buried in that mag right now. We can nab him for sure!

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.400
Someone cut this rope and trigger the trap.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.860
I'll jump in there and finish him off!

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.950
Anything can be a sword if you polish it enough.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.410
Okajima-kun's porn-sword might just run Korosensei through.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.040
Bwoop!

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.500
Wh-What the... His eyes just went all "bwoop"!

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.790
I don't have any data on that face!

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.630
What kind of porn does that signify?!

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.720
Stag Stag Stag Stag Stag

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.800
There you are!

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:31.800
Stag Stag

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.060
A Miyama stag beetle.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.680
And look at that eye color!

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.200
Are they white, Korosensei?

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.600
Ah, Kurahashi-san!

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.770
Indeed they are!

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.480
Wow! Just what I've been looking for!

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.070
Yes, right here on this mountain!

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.860
Oh, man! And we were so close!

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:58.830
Miyama stag! Miyama stag! Yay!

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.610
I don't know what they're so happy about,

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.740
but a giant stag beetle and a junior-high girl jumping around on all that porn?

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.370
That's one hell of a sight.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.880
Mortifying! How super-duper mortifying!

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.990
I'm so ashamed. Such behavior is unbecoming of an educator.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.760
I knew there was a trap under all this porn,

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.810
but with each magazine more to my taste than the last,

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:19.930
I couldn't resist!

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.520
He saw right through it.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.960
So what's the big deal, Kurahashi?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.190
That's a Miyama stag beetle, right?

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.190
In games and stuff, they sell for way less than a giant stag.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.920
Miyamas've been selling for more lately.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.370
They're still hard to breed.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.830
One this size could fetch twenty thousand.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:38.700
Twenty thousand?!

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.450
Plus, take a good look at his eyes.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.170
They're usually black, but these are white.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.420
I taught you about albinism in biology class, right?

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.130
Oh, yeah... Like the super-rare creatures born pure white?

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.090
Yes, and albino stag beetles are only white in the eyes.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.830
A natural-born Miyama white-eye, as they're known, is extremely rare.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.890
Why, this even has academic value.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.600
You could sell this for hundreds of thousands of yen, easy.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.400
Hundreds?!

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.740
I told Korosensei I was hoping I could see one someday,

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.650
and he said he'd use his zoom eyes to find one for me!

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.450
Okay, you lowlifes: whoever wants this baby, raise your hand!

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.410
Me!

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.870
What to do, what to do?

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.870
I was the one who caught it!

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.250
In killing, in porn, in living things:

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.000
summer vacation is full of learning and discoveries.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.750
One more week until our assassination vacation to that tropical island.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:43.150
Old Campus Old Campus Old Campus

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.390
Old Campus

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.180
One more week until our assassination vacation to that tropical island.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.190
Old Campus

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.900
We'd gotten together to train for it and put our plans in order.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.780
Well, well! I see you little brats are working up a good sweat,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.360
summer vacation notwithstanding.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.640
You should train too, Bitch-sensei.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.570
Your gun and knife skills aren't that much better than ours.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.790
Grownups are sneaky.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.790
I'll just hitch a ride on your strategy and take the best parts for myself.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.890
You think you're a big shot, huh, Irina?

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.460
L-Lovro-sensei!

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.130
He's here as a special instructor for the summer.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.800
He'll give us tips on our strategy from a pro's perspective.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.810
Spend one day resting, and your fingers and arms forget about killing.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.270
If you don't want to flunk out, hurry and get changed!

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.730
Yes, sir!

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.430
Even Bitch-sensei can't say no to him.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.320
Yeah, well, he's one scary dude.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.230
Thank you for your assistance.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.820
To make matters worse,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.490
I lost contact with the assassins who'd shown the most promise.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.280
Were they scared off, knowing that even the pros had failed?

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.710
Perhaps.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.920
Now all we can do is leave it up to them.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.500
In any case, am I correct in understanding that he is absent today?

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.420
Yes. He'd had a trip to Everest planned,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.220
so he's there now, beating the heat.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.430
Good. A confidential strategy is essential for an assassination.
Karuizawa? If you're serious, you'll go to Mt. Everest! To the peak!

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.020
I see.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.100
First, we destroy the seven promised tentacles,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.480
then the entire class immediately jumps in to finish him off.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.940
So far, so good...

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.660
But what's this very first step: "psychological warfare"?

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.870
First we throw him off, blunting his moves.

Secret Secret

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.080
Korosensei was scavenging for dirty magazines earlier.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:34.920
Stag Stag Stag Stag Stag

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:29.420
Stag Stag Stag

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.420
Just don't tell your classmates, all right?

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:32.420
Stag Stag

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.920
So he paid each of us off with an ice pop.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.840
As if that'd be enough to keep our mouths shut in this day and age!

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.880
The entire class will be ganging up and picking on him!

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.180
First we'll corner him with that blackmail material... and more.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.350
A brutal assassination method indeed.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.150
But the key is that final, killing blow.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:57.190
Pinpoint timing and accurate aim will be crucial.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.650
Are you worried about this class' firepower?

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:05.070
Quite the opposite. Those two in particular are outstanding.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.120
Chiba Ryuunosuke.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.210
He excels at spatial calculations.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.420
As a long-distance sniper, he's second to none.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:20.170
Hayami Rinka has a nice balance of dexterous fingers and kinetic visual acuity.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.430
She's a soldier who's well equipped to take down a moving target.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.510
Neither is very assertive.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.140
They're the professional type, so their results do the talking.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.730
I would even take them for my own students.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.900
The others are at a respectable level as well.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.110
Good job identifying and nurturing their talents in such a short time.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.320
I see plenty of potential here.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.880
See how your aim has stabilized?

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.460
Some shoot better cross-legged than with one knee up.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.460
Yes, sir!

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.760
Now that's a pro!

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.410
You seem to be having trouble keeping pace with others.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.720
Don't force yourself. Instead, go for a firing style that suits you.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.090
I wanted to ask him something,

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.340
this man who knew everything about being an assassin...

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.260
Lovro-san?

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.270
This boy...

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:13.930
Yes?

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.480
What's the very best assassin like?

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.020
On closer inspection, he has what it takes.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.440
And what's more...

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.030
So you're interested in the world of assassins, eh?

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.910
Oh, uh, th-that's not why I...

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.410
Well, there's only one person on this planet

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.370
who can be called the very best assassin.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:43.770
As is often the case in this line of work, no one knows his real name.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.010
They know him by a single alias.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:47.970
Namely:

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.140
"The Reaper."

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.350
Elusive, incomparably cold-blooded, and with piles of bodies in his wake,

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.440
he is known as Death himself.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.150
If you keep having trouble killing your target...

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.030
the Reaper will show up sooner or later.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:11.080
If someone like that might be coming, we can't let this island chance pass us by!

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.540
Very well, young man.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.080
I shall teach you a deadly technique.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.580
Deadly?

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:24.210
Yes: a move guaranteed to kill, from this pro assassin to you.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.930
After that, our tropical-island assassination tour began in earnest.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.450
Not a boat... Anything but a boat!

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:53.240
Everything in my head is going to spill right out!

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.240
Korosensei's Weak Point #8:
Prone to motion sickness

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.580
Oh! Get up, Korosensei, get up! You can see it now!

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.290
Six hours from Tokyo!

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.540
The place where we'll kill Korosensei!

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.500
The island!

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.930
Welcome to the Fukuma Resort Hotel!

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.970
Please enjoy this tropical juice with our compliments.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.760
Man, this is the life!

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.690
Everything's just so bright and vibrant!

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.810
We can go directly to the beach from the hotel.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.110
Looks like they have plenty of leisure activities available, too.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.780
We'll save the you-know-what till after dinner.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.110
First, let's have some fun, Korosensei!

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.530
In groups, like we did on our school trip!

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.500
I'm all for it. Play hard, kill hard!

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.920
That's what makes this an assassination vacation!

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.130
Hey, why's that one glider going so fast?

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:52.380
There's no way he should be able to pull off a turn that sharp followed by a barrel roll!

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.390
No fair, Korosensei!

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.560
The power difference here is just way too great!

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.480
Maximum instantaneous velocity measured at 150 kilometers per hour.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.110
With a fighter jet, it all comes down to the engine.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.880
Who's that supposed to be?

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.200
Horikoshi Jirou.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.360
No, that's the guy who voiced him!

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.200
Too hard!

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.360
Besides, he didn't fly 'em, he just built 'em!

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.990
It's just all wrong!

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.130
Group 1 is doing a good job of throwing him off.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.580
They sure are—and with a little assassination in the mix.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.230
They're trying not to draw his attention to the other groups.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.790
Yeah.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.730
We're up next! Let's do what we have to do and get changed ASAP!

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:33.930
Got it!

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.510
We make it look like we're having fun, but we're dead serious.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.470
We give the place a good once-over

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.730
to see if we can kill him according to plan.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.060
What kind of pattern is that, Korosensei?

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.550
A sunburn. Only the frontmost point of the glider was shading me.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.910
Now, Group 4 is going dolphin-watching, yes?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.910
Yep! In a boat, though. Is that okay?

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.080
Sea-rtainly!

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.120
While one group hangs out with Korosensei,

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.460
the rest work on their preparations.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.580
Where's Korosensei?

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.340
Touring deep-sea caves with Group 3.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:14.300
No way he can see us here.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.760
Then we're free to pick out our sniper spots.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.010
Let's make it quick.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.020
Those two sure are cool customers.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.790
They already feel like total pros.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.730
Wh-What the hell?

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.450
The beach is utterly deserted!

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.910
The last guest just left.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.430
The E Class has rented out the hotel and its environs.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.410
You know that's overkill!

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.170
Why does this happen every time I step out in a swimsuit?!

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.920
This is one large-scale assassination plan—the biggest one yet.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.260
So far, it's gone off without a hitch.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.880
C'mon, Karasuma. I want to bewitch someone!

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.760
C'mooon!
The only thing left to worry about...

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.470
H-Hey, wait—

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.930
Look at you, taking charge!

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.600
We might be alone with each other, but I wasn't expect—

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.100
What was that for?!

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.900
There's something I need to ask you, Irina.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.570
You, the pro assassin, said it yourself:

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.950
it's not often that your work goes as expected.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.160
Yes, that's right. I saw the documents.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.790
Chances are a complex plan like this will go off the rails once or twice.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.530
Do I look like I'm just having fun here?

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.080
I'm gunning for my share of the spoils, of course.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.090
I'll get my opportunity when the brats' plan goes awry—

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.470
and I won't let it get away.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.770
I just hope the assassination goes smoothly.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.060
Phew! What fun that was!

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.440
No wonder I'm so tanned!

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.520
That's beyond tanned!

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.890
Even your teeth are tanned.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.860
So much for picking up on your expressions.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.200
All right, Korosensei, after dinner comes the assassination.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.620
Yes, yes. First, the shipboard restaurant!

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.660
Hasn't that octopus had enough fun for one day?

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.580
Meanwhile, we got to pretend to have fun while we got everythin' ready!

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.840
Well, if we kill him today, we can just enjoy ourselves tomorrow.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.720
I guess. Let's put in some effort and finish the job!

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.470
Here we are,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.480
at the shipboard restaurant we've rented out.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.520
Let's slowly savor our meal as we take in the night sea.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.880
I get it.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.900
First you'll get me good and seasick to weaken my capabilities, eh?

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.110
Of course. That's Assassination 101.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.320
You're so right.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.340
But will it really work that well?

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:48.140
Seasickness is no match for a teacher who's all pumped up anticipating an assassination—

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.500
You're too dark!

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.320
Am I really that dark?

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.290
Forget your expression, we can't even tell front from back!

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.840
It's too confusing. Do something about it, would you?

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.590
Have you forgotten, students?

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:04.390
I can molt—and in so doing, shed this dark skin!

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.970
There! Back to normal.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.060
That's your once-a-month molt!

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.350
Just another of its uses.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.400
I tend to save it for particularly sticky situations, but...

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:22.650
What an idiot, hobbling himself before an assassination!
That's right: just once a month.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.910
How have we not been able to kill this screw-up yet?
I guess at least you can see my expressions now.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:30.100
We'd spent all summer doing special training in preparation for this day.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.160
Everything was in place.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:37.000
This time... This time, our blades would reach him.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:48.250
All right, Korosensei. Dinner's over.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.020
Here's where we're meeting.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.190
A floating chapel, away from the hotel.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.170
Take a seat, Korosensei.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.740
There's nowhere for you to run here.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.440
It'll be a fun assassination.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.450
We'll start with a movie.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.850
Your intelligence, your inventiveness, and your earnest efforts...

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.590
Those are what I most look forward to.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.960
I expect a no-holds-barred assassination!

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.430

Foreign rhinoceros beetles and stag beetles have become widely sold in Japan

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.670
after a ban on their import was lifted in '99.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.600
They could wipe out native species if released into the wild.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.280
In fact, Kurahashi-san, atlas beetles were found in Hokkaido in 2003!
