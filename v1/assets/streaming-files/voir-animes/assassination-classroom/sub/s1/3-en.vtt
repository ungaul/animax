Korosensei Korosensei Korosensei

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.820
Ah, the sounds of exercise echoing across the field on a sunny afternoon.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.110
Korosensei Korosensei How peaceful.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.110
Korosensei Korosensei Korosensei

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.530
Or so it would be if the students didn't have weapons in their hands.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.950
Korosensei Korosensei Korosensei Korosensei Korosensei
Practice swinging your knives from all eight directions.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.040
Korosensei

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.840
I'll be in charge of physical education from now on.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.060
I'm feeling a bit left out.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.240
Didn't I tell you to make yourself scarce during this period?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.970
Go play in the sandbox or something.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.960
You're so mean, Karasuma-sensei.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.100
I'll have you know that my students happen to like my P.E. activities!

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.350
Yeah, right.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.070
Your physical abilities are too far out there.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.820
Don't you remember what happened last time?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.200
Now, let's try jumping from side to side.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.530
Korosensei Korosensei Korosensei Korosensei Korosensei

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.230
Korosensei Korosensei Korosensei

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.780
I'll show you how it's done, so watch and learn!

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.570
Korosensei

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.120
As if!

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.950
Once you get the hang of it, you can add in some cat's cradle.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.660
Damn, he's good!

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.540
He's in a class of his own.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.380
I'd rather have a human P.E. teacher, thanks.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800
Okay, let's get back to it.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.050
But is there any point to all this training, Karasuma-sensei?

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.560
And should we be doing it right under our target's nose?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.560
Assassination follows the same principle as studying:

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.520
drill the basics and they'll serve you well.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.810
The same?

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.480
Isogai-kun, Maehara-kun, step forward.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.200
Try to strike me with those knives.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.280
Are you sure?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.570
As a team?

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.970
They're harmless to humans, so don't worry.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.790
If you can touch me, even lightly, you may all go home for the day.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.960
Uh... well, er...

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.790
Okay, then.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.840
Come on.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.640
As you see, with a little training,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.850
even I can handle the knives of two amateurs.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.270
Wow!

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.320
If you can't even hit me,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.860
you haven't got a snowball's chance in Hell against our Mach-20 teacher.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.870
See? While we were sparring,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.330
he built Osaka Castle in the sandbox, changed clothes, and brewed up some tea!

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.960
That really grinds my gears.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.670
Once the whole class is capable of hitting me,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.880
your chance of success will increase dramatically.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.220
During P.E., I'll be teaching you stabbing, shooting,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.470
and the other basics of assassination.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.060
Whoa.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.270
That's all for today.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.520
Thank you!

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.530
Karasuma-sensei's kinda scary, but he sure is cool!

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.660
I know, right? You think he'll pat us on the head if we manage to hit him?

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.820
I wonder.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.950
You're trying to steal my students away from me, aren't you?

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.040
Don't be ridiculous.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.500
"If the school so desires, it may assign an additional teacher to the E class."

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.300
It's right there in your employment contract, I believe.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.720
My duty is to provide on-site monitoring of our assassins—

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.600
all in the name of killing you.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.230
I have a name, you know.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.940
The students came up with it.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.020
Please call me "Korosensei."

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.650
A quiz in sixth period, eh?

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.990
Shame we didn't get to go home after all.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.120
Hey, Nagisa-kun.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.330
It's been a while.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.460

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.640
Oh?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.900
So this is the infamous Korosensei?

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.980
Whoa, he really does look like an octopus.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.540
You're Akabane Karma-kun, right?

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.450
I'd heard your suspension was up today.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.160
But that's no excuse to be late on your first day back.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.120
It's hard to get back into the swing of things.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.040
And feel free to call me by my first name.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.900
It's nice to meet you, Sensei.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.090
Likewise. Let's make this a fun year.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.600
Wow. Looks like you're as fast as they say.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.230
And these knives are as effective as they say.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.810
I cut one up into tiny little pieces and stuck them to my hand.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.860
But I'm surprised you fell for such a simple move.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.740
You jumped back so far, too. What are you, a scaredy-cat?

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.950
No one's ever hurt Korosensei before.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.710
He's the first one!

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.670
I heard "Korosensei" comes from "korosenai," or "unkillable."

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.470
But what's this? Could you be a pushover after all?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.060
Nagisa, what kind of person is this Karma-kun?

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.220
Well...

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.140
We were in the same class during first and second year,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.940
but he was suspended due to his persistently violent behavior.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.190
Those violent tendencies are also what landed him in E Class.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.780
But here, he might just top the class.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.120
How do you mean?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.580
When it comes to deadly weapons and foul play, Karma-kun's got us all beat.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.680
Don't go anywhere, Korosensei.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.700
I'll show you what it's like to be killed.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.980
What's Korosensei been doing all this time?

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.610
Is he punching the wall or something?

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.780
Yeah. Karma's smack-talking must've made him mad.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.860
His tentacles are too soft to do any damage, though.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.580
Korosensei's Weak Point #4:

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.930
Punches like a wet sponge Ugh, that's it!

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.580
Enough with the squishing!

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.950
We're trying to take a quiz here!

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.660
P-Pardon me!

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.540
Hey, Karma, you sure about this?

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.040
That monster's pissed.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.210
And we're sure as hell not gettin' involved.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.170
Sure you wouldn't be better off holin' up at home?

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.510
You'd be pissed too, Terasaka, if you were nearly killed.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.390
It's a bit different to just having someone fail miserably and piss himself instead.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.100
I did not piss myself! You cruisin' for a bruisin', pal?

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.980
You there! No noise during a test!

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.980
Tell that to your tentacles!

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.360
You're lucky I haven't done you in for cheating!

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.320
Sorry, Korosensei. I've already finished,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.280
so I'll just sit here quietly and eat my gelato.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.240
Not during class, you won't!

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.660
Th-That's the gelato I brought back from Italy yesterday!

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.000
It's yours?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.300
Oh, sorry! It was just chilling in the staff room.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.590
"Sorry" won't cut it!

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.550
I took pains to fly through the freezing stratosphere to keep it from melting, too!

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.600
That so? Well, whaddya gonna do about it?

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.510
Hit me?

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.980
I will not! I'll just have what's left!

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.440
Come now, hand it o—

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.690
Anti-teacher pellets!

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.740
Gotcha again!

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.780
I'll just keep using the same old tricks.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.030
I don't even care if it interferes with class.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.960
If you don't like it, feel free to kill me or anyone else here.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.000
But the instant you do...

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.340
no one'll see you as a teacher anymore.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.090
You'll just be a murderous monster.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.890
Your identity as a teacher will be killed. By me.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.850
Here's my quiz. Probably got 'em all right.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.640
See ya, Sensei.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.820
Let's play some more tomorrow.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.400
Karma-kun is extremely quick-witted.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.530
Just now, for example,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.080
he saw there was a line Korosensei couldn't cross without losing his status as teacher

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.790
and used various tactics to bring that teacher to the brink.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.000
He has the smarts to see the heart of the matter

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.920
and the skill to handle just about anything,

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.590
but he uses them to butt heads with people.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.350
For crying out loud.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.680
Now he's forced me to go buy more gelato.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.860
He's smart and tough, but as he says, if I want to remain a teacher,

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.660
I'm not allowed to kill or hurt him.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.320
So, how do I deal with him?

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.540
Kunugigaoka Station Kunugigaoka Station
Kunugigaoka Station See ya, Nagisa!

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
Kunugigaoka Station Yep! See you tomorrow!

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.080
Hey, look! It's Nagisa!

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.670
He must be right at home down in E Class.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:00.300
What a lamer. He'll never make it out of there unless he shapes up.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.560
Plus, now that Akabane's back from suspension, he's in E Class too!

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.140
That's the pits! I would seriously rather die than wind up there.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.230
Really? You'd rather die?

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.190
How about right now, then?

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.740
Akabane!

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.280
Like I'd actually do it.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.870
Who'd want another suspension after discovering such a wonderful plaything?

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:29.830
Karma-kun...

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.040
So listen, Nagisa-kun, there's something I wanted to ask you.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.340
I understand you know a few things about Korosensei.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.970
Uh, well, kind of.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.260
Does he get mad if you call him an octopus?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.100
An octopus?

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.020
Octo-wrong!

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.310
This is an easy mistake to make. Be careful.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.560
I think it's the opposite.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.480
I mean, he draws himself as an octopus, Octo-wrong!
Octo-wrong!

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.690
and he picks the octopus character in games.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.650
And when he was digging around in the sandbox...

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.110
Octopus trap.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.550
So if he's making jokes like that,

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:04.160
I'd say the octopus thing is kind of like his trademark.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.950
That so?

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.540
Hmm. A silly idea just crossed my mind.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.860
What are you up to now, Karma-kun?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.420
I'm just happy.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.710
I was wondering what I'd do if he were just some monster,

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.930
but turns out he's an actual teacher.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.310
So I finally get to kill an actual teacher.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.300
I mean, after the last one went and died on me.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.740
I didn't see this coming.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.700
I'm all out of gelato money!

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.330
And no hope of getting more before payday!

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.130
I'll just have to make my own.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.630
Good morning!

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.970
What's the matter, cla—

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.640
Whoops! My bad!

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.390
I killed that creature thinking it was you.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.230
Bring it here. I'll dispose of it.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.360
All right.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.320
Bring it on, Korosensei.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.650
I don't need to kill your body yet.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.370
Instead, I'll start by slowly destroying your soul.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.540
Now, now, Karma-kun. Allow me to show you...

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:43.170
the power of these drill tentacles and this missile I filched from the Self Defense-Force!

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.930
I'm not about to let my assassin get away scot-free.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.100
I could tell by your pallor that you hadn't eaten breakfast, you see.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.640
So I whipped up a batch of takoyaki at Mach speed.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.860
With these, you'll be well on your way to being nice and healthy.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.860
Open wide!

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.820
Karma-kun...

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.250
My job is to tend things. To take care of them.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.280
Things like assassins' rusty blades.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.310
So keep trying your hardest to kill me today.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.620
Every time you do, I'll take care of you.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.840
By the end of the day, your body and mind will be polished to sparkling.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.720

If this indivisibility is getting you down,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.060
then have I got the method for you!

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.310
I'll write it on the blackboard.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.400
Everyone try solving it together.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.940
Oh, Karma-kun? I'm afraid you're a touch too slow on the draw.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.280
I thought I'd use the extra time I had to give you a little nail art.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.880
I dunno. It has this kind of sharp tang to it.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.240
Let me try.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.840
Well, why don't you start over?

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.920
Toss that batch out, and...

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.550
You forgot your apron, Karma-kun.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.100
Don't worry about the soup.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.310
I collected it all in midair with an eyedropper.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.810
I added a little sugar while I was at it, too.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.770
It's much milder now!

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.070
Aw, how cute.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:28.820
It's no use.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.610

Korosensei has tons of weaknesses.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.330
"Why didn't it try to cross there?"
He slips up from time to time,

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.620
and his reaction speed drops to human levels when he's flustered.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.620
But no matter how good Karma-kun is at surprise attacks...
"Even as I was thinking this...

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:48.300
...the red frog, having failed again, was making its way back."

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.550
"I was starting to get bored with it."

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.720
"Picking up some stones from the road,
...with Korosensei on especially high alert,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.890
I began throwing them at the sandbar."
this assassination was like an impossibly tough video game.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.980
"I was not trying to hit the red frog..."

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.570
Karma-kun.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.450
Don't sweat it. We'll all do it together.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.530
Once Korosensei has his eye on you,

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.360
you can't kill him by yourself, no matter the method.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.290
He's not like other teachers.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.460
Teachers, eh?

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.000
Akabane, you're right!

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.710
Though you are somewhat combative, and you have your share of behavioral issues...

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:35.050
as long as you're in the right, I'll be on your side!

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.010
Yeah, no.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.220
I want to do it.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.390
Nothing would tick me off more than him dying in some random way.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.730
Karma-kun?

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.360
I've certainly taken good care of you today, haven't I?

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.950
You can still try to kill me, you know.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.820
I'll polish you up even shinier.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.250
Just to make sure...

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.290
You are a teacher, right?

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:06.920
Right.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.250
And you would, say,

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.670
risk your life to protect one of your students?

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.260
Of course. I'm a teacher, after all.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.890
Okay, good.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.970
Then I can kill you.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.430
For sure.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.110
So, what'll it be?

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.820
If you come to help, I'll shoot you before you can save me.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.410
If you just let me die, your life as a teacher is over.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.240
Oh, man! It's all flashing before my eyes!

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.870
Are you all right, Senpai?

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.380
3-E? You mean that 3-E?

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.250
How awful it must be to have your fate decided in such a way.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.920
Huh? I'm in the right here.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.340
What's wrong with saving a bullied student?

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.800
No, Akabane.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.060
No matter how you look at it, you're in the wrong!

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.140
Have you lost your mind?

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.770
Where do you get off, injuring the best student in Year 3?

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.690
Huh?

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.210
No, wait, Sensei...

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.740
You sided with the E Class and hurt someone who still had a bright future.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.520
If this affects his exams, it'll be on my head!

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.750
So much for being on my side.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.460
Crap. He's dying Crap. He's dying Crap. He's dying.
Crap. He's dying Crap. He's dying Crap. He's dying

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.670
Your grades are the only thing that's right about you.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.220
They're the reason I've always looked the other way.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.890
But once you start hurting my career, that's a different story.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:47.100
In my eyes, this teacher's dying.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.810
I put in for your transfer.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.920
Congratulations, Akabane.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.530
You'll be starting your third year in the E Class.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.160
He let me down.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.990
Now he's dead to me.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.210
Korosensei! I'll kill you with my own two hands!

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.710
Now, which death do you choose?

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.090
Karma-kun?

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:23.140
Splendid job on the premeditated assassination starring yourself.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.850
If I'd saved you at Mach speed, your body wouldn't have been able to take it,

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.980
and if I'd moved slowly, I'd have been hit.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.150
So I thought I'd try a stickier approach.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.190
Damn! What can't these tentacles do?!

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.240
You can't shoot me now!

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.570
Oh, and for the record:

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.370
letting you die is not an option for me.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.790
Feel free to take a leap of faith any time you like.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.840
It's no use.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.010
He won't die, no matter what I do.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.350
Not the teacher part of him, anyway.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.390
That was a lot crazier than you made it seem, Karma-kun.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.810
Eh, no biggie.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.980
As far as I could see,

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.480
that would've been my best chance at killing him.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.110
Oh? Out of ideas already?

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.950
But I have so many ways left to pamper you in retaliation.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.830
You're kind of a pushover yourself, aren't you?!

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.160
I'm still feeling murderous,

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.870
but this time it's different somehow.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.040
Oh, I'll kill you. Maybe even tomorrow.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.250
A healthy, refreshing bloodlust.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.260
Looks like you don't need any more of my special care.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.340
Let's head on back, Nagisa-kun.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.260
We can eat on the way.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.560
Hey! That's my purse!

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.270
And who left it in the staff room unattended?

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.730
Give it back!

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:57.520
If you say so.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.240
But... This is empty!

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.070
There wasn't much in there to begin with. Call it a donation.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.250
You hypocritical delinquent!

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.580
Assassins go in for the kill

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.960
and wind up sparkling clean in their target's tentacles.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.050
That's our assassination classroom.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.760
I wonder how we'll try to kill him tomorrow?

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.010
Do you hear me?!

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.120
As the narrator watched the red frog tenaciously try to reach the far shore,

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.110
how did he change his mind about what he initially viewed as meaningless effort for an impossible task?

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.820
Do you get it, Karma-kun?
