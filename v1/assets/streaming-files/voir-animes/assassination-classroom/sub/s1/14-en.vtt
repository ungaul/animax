WEBVTT

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.480
Phew! Helter swelter!

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.690
That's what they say in Osaka when a heat wave hits.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.320
Jeez, it's hot.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.400
Why's he got us out here on the mountain at the back?

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.740
If he's looking for a pool, there's one at the main campus.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.910
But that's not in this direction, is it?

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.950
No.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.660
Hey, Nagisa-kun,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.470
I hear you really knocked 'em dead the other day.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.670
I sure wish I could've seen that assassination of yours.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.800
It might have worked against a human,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.670
but in our classroom, that doesn't mean a thing.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.640
Day in and day out, we try everything we can think of,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.350
but we still haven't found a surefire way to assassinate our teacher.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.810
All right, we're here!

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.220
Behold!

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.110
A pool I made specially for the E Class!

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.780
Woohoo!

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.670
Then our teacher does stuff like this, which makes him pretty hard to kill!

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.960
It's fun, but a little depressing.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960
I'm a terrible swimmer,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.020
and this suit leaves nothing to the imagination.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.600
Don't worry, Kayano.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.060
I'm sure there's someone out there who appreciates you for what you are.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.020
You know, Okajima-kun, the nice-guy routine and pervy camera don't really go hand-in-hand.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.240
Nagisa... You...

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.570
You're a boy!
You just noticed?!

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.950
Can you blame us?

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.830
Kimura-kun! No running at the poolside!

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.580
You could trip and hurt yourself!

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.120
Oh, s-sorry.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.500
Hara-san, Nakamura-san!

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.670
Watch the breath-holding!

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.170
If you stay under too long, how will we know you haven't drowned?

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.630
Okajima-kun, I'm confiscating that camera!

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.720
Hazama-san, don't just read all day! Swim!

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.930
Wh-What a fusspot.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.480
I've heard of these.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.570
You know, people who act like royalty in their own domain.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.900
Yeah... It sorta puts a damper on all our gratitude.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.280
My elaborate plan makes the most of the natural surroundings, from the scenery to the design.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.200
It must be enjoyed in an orderly fashion!

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.000
Korosensei's Weak Point #22:
Super-strict about pool rules
Aw, don't be such a stick-in-the-mud, Korosensei!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.210
Have a splash!

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.800
What was that scream?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.340
Karma-kun! Stop that!

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.260
I'll fall in!

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.720
I'm going to fall! Do you hear me?!

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.680
I'll fall in! Please!

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.390
Korosensei... Don't tell me...

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.430
Oh, I just don't feel like swimming. That's all.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.580
It's not like my tentacles get too swollen for me to move or anything.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.760
He...

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.690
Korosensei's Weak Point #23:
Can't swim He can't swim!

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.570
This might be his most promising weak point yet!

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.820
But what's with that kickboard of yours?

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.680
I was sure you were gonna swim.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.740
This is not a kickboard!

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.990
It is a wafer!

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.200
That's a snack?!

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.540

Pre-Exam Slithery

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.660

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.740
Well, uh...

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.660
Even after we three swore we wouldn't give him the time of day?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.960
But there's a big difference between slithery and non-slithery—

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.170
Enough with the "slithery"!

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.630
You just played both sides till you got the grades you wanted. Damn traitor!

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.840
I don't like how everyone's fallin' for that octopus hook, line, and sinker.

Oh, uh, hey, Terasaka!

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.280
The two of us were talkin' motorcycles the other day,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.410
since no one else in school is into 'em.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.790
Not only am I a grown-up, I am also a man among men.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.370
I've been known to dabble in this kind of hobby.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.380
Plus, this baby can hit three hundred kilometers an hour.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.340
What I wouldn't give to ride the real thing one day!

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.640
You kiddin'? It'd be faster just to pick it up and fly!

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.560
The hell, Terasaka? What was that for?!

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.060
You apologize right now!

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.230
Korosensei's not just a grown-up, he's a man among men! And you made him cry!

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.190
Yeah, what she said!

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.030
You guys are just buzzin' like a bunch of bugs...

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.530

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.870

A bug bomb?

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.410
Terasaka-kun! Pranks are pranks, but this is going too—

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.780
Don't touch me, monster.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.830
You're beyond creepy—and so are all of you,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.500
getting' pulled into bein' all buddy-buddy with a monster!

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.170
What's got you so bothered, hmm?

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.130
If you don't like it, just kill him.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.890
You're allowed to do that here, after all.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.230
You tryin' to start somethin'?

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.970
Fine by me! From day one, you've been—

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.730
Now, now, Terasaka.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.150
If you want to fight, actions speak louder than words.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.770
Lemme go!

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.230
Buncha losers.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.570
What's with him?

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.160
Does he have to stir things up?

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.480
A world in crisis, self-improvement in the name of assassination,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.630
recovering from being left in the dust...

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.430
Honestly, I don't give a damn about any of it.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.720
I just wanna take it easy and live each day as it comes.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.300
And that's why... Well done.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.260
Here's your 100,000-yen reward.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.350
We got a lot of prep work done, thanks to you.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.690
Now, these guys I don't mind.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.770
That octopus has a good nose on him.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.490
That's why we needed someone on the inside, like you,

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.660
to help us set the stage for Itona to really show his stuff.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.410
Terasaka Ryouma, I understand all too well how you feel.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.670
Just relax. Follow my plan to the letter,

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.960
and he'll be dead before you know it.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.010
We'll put the E Class back to the way it was before he came.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.720
You... You're weaker than that red-headed fellow,

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.970
even though you've got more raw energy and a better physique.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.640
Do you know why I can tell?

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.770
There's no vision in your eyes.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.020
No will or way or want to win.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.900
The slow-witted cow who dimly chews the grass before it

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.950
is no match for the wolf with a cow-killing vision.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.580
Why, you little... Now, now.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.030
Tomorrow we act.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.160
We're counting on you.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.220
What's with all the crying over nothing?

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.300
No, no... These are my nostrils.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.090
m 1183.5 483 l 1548 627 1629 384 1263 261
Nostrils I'm not crying. My nose is running.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.510
These are my eyes.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.810
m 192 259.5 l 585 267 579 501 225 519
Eyes What's the difference?!

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.520
I've been feeling a little off since yesterday.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.440
Oh, Terasaka-kun!

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.650
I was worried you wouldn't come in today!

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.650
The spray can you let loose in the classroom yesterday

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.660
was like a cedar-pollen allergen that works only on him.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.170
It dulls the senses of tentacled lifeforms.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.500
Now that you've done that, reel him in.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.370
Hey, octopus.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.210
It's time we killed you for real.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.210
Come to the pool after class.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.670
After all, I hear water's your weakness.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.930
You all come help!

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.550
I'll knock him smack into the water for you!

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.520
You haven't helped with anyone else's assassination, Terasaka.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.690
And now you're ordering us around when it suits you?

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.730
You really think anyone's gonna jump at the chance to help you?

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.390
Like I give a damn either way.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.950
Hell, I'd be happy to have the ten-billion-yen prize all to myself.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.210
What's his deal?

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.450
I can't keep up!

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.200
Well, I'm not going.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.450
Same.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.500
Oh, let's all go!

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.420
Whoa, his snot's all hardened! We can't escape!

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.960
Terasaka-kun's all ready to assassinate me now!

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.010
This is the perfect chance for everyone to kill and make up!

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.880
First of all: you are gross!

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.970
Terasaka-kun!

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.100
Are you really going to kill him?

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.350
Well, geez, Nagisa.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.930
'Course I am.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:30.020
Then maybe you should tell everyone your plan of action.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.310
Aw, shut it!

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.650
You weaklings, always cowerin' together!

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.690
It ain't like you got a vision for really killing him!

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.800
But I'm not like the rest of you.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.410
I got a vision for killing him, all right. Easy as pie!

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.370
Terasaka-kun seemed confident enough in his plan,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.630
but not in himself.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.300
Even his words sounded like someone else's.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.510
The disjointedness of it all was unsettling.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.800
Yeah, there we go!

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.930
Everyone spread out in the pool, just like that!

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.270
Who does he think he is?

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.350
I have my doubts about this.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.100
Do you even have what it takes to make another person swim?

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.190
Hey, Takebayashi, shut up and get in!

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.690
Terasaka's turned downright tyrannical.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.160
Just like he was back in first and second year.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.660
Ah, I see.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.620
You'll knock me into the water and have everyone stab me, yes?

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.410
Then tell me: how do you plan to do so?

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.460
That pistol won't make me move a single step.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.980
This is not a gun but a transmitter that will send us a signal.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.600
Once everyone is standing by in the pool, pull the trigger to alert us.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.060
You ready for this, monster?

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.310
Of course I am. My nose has even stopped running.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.810
I've always hated you. Wanted more than anything for you to disappear.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.780
Yes, I know.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.280
After this assassination, we'll have a nice, long talk.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.530
You think you can get cocky with me?

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.740
C'mon, Itona!

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.790
My students!

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.710
We're being swept away!

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.540
You'll have to jump in and save them, Korosensei.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:22.010
No way... You never told me about this!

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.600
It's steep and rocky up ahead.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.660
if they fall, they're done for!

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.770
In the time it takes him to be nice and save them,

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.690
his tentacles are absorbing more and more water.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.780
Mucus can protect them from a little water.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.280
That's right, Itona.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.870
He can use mucus to solidify the water around him and tweak the permeation pressure.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.210
But he's all out of mucus.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.340
What the hell?

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.210
I... I didn't do anything!

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.590
It ain't like what he said.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.930
I was supposed to get Itona over here and push him in!

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.220
Oh, I get it.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.350
It wasn't your plan.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.390
You were just being strung along.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.850
Look, I'm tellin' ya, it's not my fault!

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.020
Blame the guy who put me up to it!

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.060
He's the reason everyone got taken for a ride!

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.870
You're the one who got taken for a ride.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.660
If you've got time to go pointing fingers,

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.660
try using it to figure out what you want to do here.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.090
Last one!

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.050
Long time no see, Korosensei.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.760
What you've sucked up there is no ordinary water.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.970
It contains a substance that dulls tentacle movement.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.230
With Terasaka-kun's help, everything went swimmingly.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.560
Itona-kun...

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.940
Come, brother.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.150
A rematch to see who's stronger.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.070
I thought I was strong.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.580
I set my sights on the weak-looking ones and put them under my thumb.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.460
That way I was sure to win.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.790
But at this school, that didn't fly.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.090
Hey, let's skip this next class and hit the convenience store!

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.470
No... I've got to prep for English next.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.850
So skip once. What's the difference?

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.310
Whoa, a monkey threatening a human!

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.930
Huh?!

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:41.360
But at this school, that didn't fly.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.690
Look, Terasaka-kun... No one does that here.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.940
Old Campus Old Campus Old Campus

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:47.280
Old Campus Old Campus
Even the big, bad leader of the pack Old Campus

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.030
Old Campus Old Campus

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.660
is a miserable weakling once he hits the E Class.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.660
Your grades put you dead last, right?

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:01.380
I can't wait for the day when I get to hurl a few stones at you in E Class!

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:08.040
That's when I realized the cheap weapon I'd been using had absolutely no effect here.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.840
In fact, it might never work again.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.310
These guys working hard toward their vision of the future

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.600
would undoubtedly grow up to boss around directionless mooks like me.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:27.400
I landed in the outcast E Class and figured I could skate by alongside my fellow goal-free students,

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.570
but I was wrong once again.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.780
That monster showed up out of nowhere

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.030
and gave the class one huge-ass goal.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:41.620
Left behind again, I wound up manipulated and used by some calculating schmuck with a plan.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.000
Dammit!

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.460
He's fast, and he hits hard!

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.250
Much harder than before!

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:52.110
We reduced the number of tentacles, focusing power and speed in those remaining.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.850
They're easy enough for a child to control.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.510
Is this for real?

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.890
Did it really take that little water to neutralize him?

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.520
It ain't just the water.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.600
Terasaka!

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.570
He can't go all-out 'cause he just got finished savin' you all.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.400
See? Look above him there.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.030
Whoa!

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.240
Token chubster Hara-san could fall at any second!

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.370
And to protect her and the others, Korosensei...

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.080
She's pretty heavy and fat, so this doesn't look good.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.000
We've got to help her!

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.210
But how?!

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.830
Wait a second... Don't tell me they roped you into doing all this!

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.790
That's right.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.970
Shortsighted guys like me with no vision and no goals

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.180
are doomed to be played by smart guys like them.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.810
But you know... At least lemme pick who gets to pull my strings.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.230
I've had it up to here with those jokers,

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.480
and I sure don't like the idea of 'em walkin' off with the prize.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.200
So, Karma... Why don't you try controllin' me?

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.570
Gimme a strategy, fresh outta that shrewd noggin of yours!

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.620
I'll pull it off perfectly and save all of them!

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.080
Fine by me, but can you even handle one of my plans?

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.620
It might be the death of you.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.620
Oh, I'll do it, all right.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.500
I'm the perpetrator who gets results.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.210
All right. Time for the killing blow, Itona.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.220
Hey!

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.590
Terasaka-kun?

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.050
You tricked me good!

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.350
Don't get so upset.

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:22.750
All you did was get your classmates in trouble.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.770
Perfect for a fellow who didn't fit into the E Class like you.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.480
Shut up! I ain't gonna forgive you for what you did!

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.030
Itona! You and me, one on one!

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.440
Stop that, Terasaka-kun!

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.940
He's not someone you can win against!

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.950
Stay outta this, octopuff!

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.740
What a hero.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.240
Shut him up, Itona.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.580
Karma-kun!
It's all right.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.540
Shiro's not out to kill us students.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.550
And it's precisely because we're alive that Korosensei's attention is divided.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.880
Even Hara-san might look like she's in trouble,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.010
but Itona's attacks won't be aimed at her.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.470
It's like I told Terasaka:

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:03.180
he'll hit you with a tentacle hard enough to knock you out,

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:09.600
but that's as fast and as powerful as it'll get, so hold on for dear life.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.570
You held up well!

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.070
All right, Itona, give him another.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.200
Terasaka's still wearing his shirt from yesterday.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.410
Which means it got a direct hit at point-blank range

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.660
from whatever was in that weird spray.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.270
That's sure to have an effect on Itona.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.130
So, with that opening in his defenses...

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.550
our octopus has a chance to rescue Hara-san.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.510
Yoshida! Muramatsu!

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.470
Gimme a real big one!

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:42.520
Seriously?

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.430
Sheesh.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.520
His weak points are the same as Korosensei's, right?

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.150
So all we have to do is give him a taste of his own medicine.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.080
You've absorbed a lot, I see.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.490
Your advantage is dwindling.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.830
So what now?

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.510
We don't want you to claim the prize money, for one.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.010
Plus, your plans almost got us all killed,

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.670
and Terasaka got all beat up in the process.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:19.930
If you want to keep going,

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.390
we're gonna have a hardcore splash party.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.020
Well, you got us.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.560
We withdraw.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.560
If we were to slaughter all these children,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.480
who knows how his antimatter organs would run amok.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.530
Let's go, Itona.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.080
Well? Didn't you have fun with everyone?

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.450
Why not join us for real this time?

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:46.910
Itona.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.040
We managed to drive 'em off.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.190
Good thing we saved your life, eh, Korosensei?

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.550
Oh, I certainly appreciate it.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.590
I still had some tricks up my sleeve, though.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.640
That reminds me, Terasaka-kun...

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.110
You said some harsh things about me back there, as I recall.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.230
So I'm heavy, am I? Fat?

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.890
I-I was just objectively analyzin' the situation at hand!

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.140
Keep your excuses!

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.150
I'll show you what an assassin-trained "fatty" can do!

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.240
You really are tactless, Terasaka.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.280
No wonder you let people take advantage of you.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.580
Shut it, Karma!

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.990
You don't get to sit up there talkin' down at me!

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.460
What?

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.000
Is this how you treat your boss?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.370
My boss? Ha!

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.460
What kind of boss would make someone take a tentacle on the chin?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.550
For a world-class slacker, you sure scored a sweet part in all this!

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.510
I was just thinking the same thing.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.600
Why not take this chance to sling a little mud?

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:49.560
Hey! Stop it!

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.720
Terasaka-kun's not cut out for putting together plans from on high.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.810
His strengths come through where he's out in the field.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:02.780
He makes himself and others shine with his physical might and the ability to get things done.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.360
I look forward to seeing him grow into an action-squad assassin.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.540
Terasaka-kun's pretty violent, but he's adjusted well to our class.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.240
We didn't show it, but Karma and I— all of us, really—were pretty happy about that.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.630
So happy that we all overlooked it.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.170
Bigger than water: Korosensei's greatest weak point of all.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.520

Kataoka-san, let's go over the basics of the front crawl.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.650
For the flutter kick, start the movement from your hip joint, and kick with your knee extended.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.900
As for the arm, start the sweep with your palm facing slightly outward.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.390
After pushing the water down all the way, rotate your shoulder to return your arm to the front.
