00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.640
Let's begin homeroom.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.650
Class monitor, on your command.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.410
S-Stand!

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.040
Attention!

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.710
Bow!

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.590
Good morning.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.170
I'll be taking attendance, so please, fire all you like.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.430
Isogai-kun?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.390
Present.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.390
My apologies. I'll need you to speak up, what with all this gunfire.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.310
Present!

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.350
Okajima-kun?

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.270
Present!

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.310
Okuda-san?

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.020
Present!

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.310
Kataoka-san?

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.940
Present!
Kayano-san?

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.480
Present!
Kanzaki-san?

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.320
Present!

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.150
All right.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.990
Everyone on time, I see.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.370
Excellent!

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.370
That makes me very happy.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.870
He's way too fast.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.450
So even the whole class at once can't bring him down?

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.620
We...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.480
are killers.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.250
And our target...

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.030
is our teacher.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.580
Too bad.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.500
Not one of your bullets hit me today, either.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.630
Tactics that rely on sheer numbers neglect individual focus.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.290
Be it line of sight, barrel position, or finger movement,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.000
each of you was far too easy to read.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.850
You need to be more inventive!

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.350
Otherwise,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.810
you'll never be able to kill me. I can speed up to Mach 20, you know?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.030
But, like, see...

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.610
There's no way you seriously dodged all of those!

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.780
I mean, these are just BB pellets.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.370
You coulda just taken them on the chin.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.540
Yeah! That's right!

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.760
Very well.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.660
Gather up the BBs and hand them over.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.050
I told you: these may be harmless to you...

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.050
but they're special anti-me BB pellets developed by the government.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.760
If one hits me, it'll slice right through my cells like tofu.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.680
They'll regenerate a few seconds later, of course.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.230
I'm more concerned about you putting a classmate's eyes out.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.440
No shooting in the classroom unless you're trying to kill me.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.410
And I do hope you can kill me— before graduation, that is.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.540
Now then, let's put away the arms and ammunition and begin class.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.330

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.020
Episode Assass ination Time

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.690
Now, here's the question:

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.770
Isogai-kun!

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.180
Y-Yes, sir?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.320
Which of these four tentacles is not like the others?

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.640
Um... the blue one?

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.820
Correct!

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.290
The only relative pronoun is "who," in the blue sentence.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.290
A relative pronoun modifies the noun right before it, so the clause
Hey, Nagisa.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.460
"who is standing over there" describes the "boy" here.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.880
The crescent moon's out in broad daylight.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.630
How did we end up in this mess?

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.560
As we began our third year of junior high, we were greeted by two extraordinary incidents.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.950
The first was the sudden explosion that left the moon permanently crescent-shaped.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.170
Most of Moon Missing?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.170
We interrupt this program to bring you breaking news.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.680
We've just gotten word that about seventy percent of the moon

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:05.420
70% of Moon Vaporized 70% of Moon Vaporized
NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Reporting:

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.420
has been vaporized into nothing. I repeat...

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.640
Will we have only a crescent moon to look at for the rest of our lives?

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.760
And the second was his arrival.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.350
How do you do?

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.560
I'm the one who tore that chunk out of your moon.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.440
I plan to do the same to the Earth next year.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.360
But until then, I'll be your teacher.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.990
Nice to meet you.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.320
There are at least six things wrong with this picture!

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.490
The feeling was unanimous.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.440
I'm Karasuma, from the Ministry of Defense.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.830
First, please understand that what I'm about to say is classified information.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.210
Allow me to be blunt:

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.180
I want you to kill this creature.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.640
Um... What's the deal?

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.300
Is he an alien invader or something?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.140
How rude!

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.350
I'll have you know I was born and raised on Earth!

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.060
He was?

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.730
I'm afraid I can't discuss the details, but he's telling the truth.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.280
And as he said, he won't stop at the moon. Next year...

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.160
he will destroy the Earth as well.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.500
Only the world's leaders know about this.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.210
If news of this guy got out there, we'd be looking at a global panic.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.170
That's why we have to kill him in secret before that happens.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.630
In other words:

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.220
an assassination.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.340
But here's the catch.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.800
His speed is unmatched!

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.260
You try to kill him,

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.260
and he ends up grooming your eyebrows instead—immaculately!

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.770
He's a superbeing with enough power to reduce the full moon to a crescent.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.280
His speed tops out at Mach 20!

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.400
In short, if he actually wanted to get away from us,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.910
we wouldn't be able to do a thing to stop him.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.370
But where's the fun in that?

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.160
So I made your government an offer.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.420
They will refrain from attempts on my life.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.880
And in return, I'll teach Class 3-E at Kunigigaoka Junior High School.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.260
What? Why?

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.220
We don't know what he's after.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.510
But we had no choice but to agree,

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:18.430
on the condition that he doesn't harm any of you students.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:25.560

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.350
We have two reasons for this.

Old Campus Old Campus Old Campus

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.850
First and foremost, if he's coming to a classroom every day to teach,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.100
we can keep an eye on him.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:30.780
And second, it gives some thirty people the opportunity to kill him from extremely close range.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:25.650
Old Campus Old Campus

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.910
Nakamura-san.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.830
Didn't I tell you not to let assassination interfere with your studies?

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.090
Sorry.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.370
Stand at the back for the rest of this lesson and think about what you've done!

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.890
"How could you make this creature our teacher?"

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.610
"And why are you making us assassinate him?"

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.670
These cries faded as one final condition was announced.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.340
Your success will be rewarded with ten billion yen.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.510
It's only fair.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.190
If you can assassinate him, you will literally save the Earth.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.070
Fortunately, he doesn't think much of you.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.980
See?

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.900
Those green stripes mean he's looking down on you!

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.990
What is he, a chameleon?!

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.240
Of course I am!

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.910
If the government can't kill me, how could you?

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.240
Even when they sent their very newest fighter jet after me,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.000
all it got was a good waxing right there in midair!

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.420
What's with all the grooming?

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.840
So while this guy looks down on you, your job is to find an opening in his defenses and strike it.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.890
We'll provide you with weapons and ammo that won't hurt humans but will work on him.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.480
You must keep this absolutely secret from your family and friends.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.600
There's no time to lose.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.320
If the Earth is destroyed, we'll have nowhere left to run.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.540
And that's about it.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.710
Well then, I hope you'll make the most of your one remaining year!

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.990
We only have one year.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.670
If we can't assassinate him by then,

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.920
the Earth will be history.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.260
Ah, lunchtime!

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.640
I'll just pop over to China for some mapo tofu.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.060
If anyone would like to try assassinating me, just call me on my cell.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.960
Uh, let's see... if he's traveling at Mach 20...

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.680
...it'll take maybe ten minutes to get to Sichuan, the home of mapo tofu.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.070
Guess no missile could shoot that down.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.580
Heck, that octopus even grades tests while he breaks the sound barrier!

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.790
Seriously?!

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.370
He even did a little drawing on mine.

Perfect answer!!
Double octopus!

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.210
Isn't he actually a pretty good teacher, though?

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.250
He is!

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.590
I aced my math test thanks to his after-school tutoring!

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:02.260
Yeah, but... we are the E Class.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.510
Tryin' our best won't do much.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.350
Yeah...

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.660
He might be an octopoid superbeing —not to mention our target—

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.350
but...

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.190
for whatever reason, he's teaching us just like any other teacher would.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.910
Likewise, we're perfectly normal students outside of the whole killer thing,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.490
but E Class is a little different from the rest.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.250
Hey, Nagisa.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.580
Come with us.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.420
It's time to put our assassination plan into action.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.800
That octopus's face changes color according to his mood, right?

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.640
Did you note down all the variations like I asked?

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.270
More or less.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.980
It's striped green when he's feeling confident, as we all know.

When we give an incorrect answer, it's dark purple.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.490
A correct answer makes it go bright scarlet.

But what's really interesting is after lunch, when—

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.200
I don't need to know all that.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.150
I have a plan.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.080
And at the moment he least expects it,

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.160
you are going to carry it out.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.960
M-Me? But... Don't be such a goody-goody.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.850
We're the E Class—

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.630
the rejects that failed to keep up at this famous prep school.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.640

We're gonna climb our way out of this shithole...

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.870
any way we can.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.660
Just don't screw up, Nagisa-kun.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.750

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.890

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.320
Not at all!

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.830
You know you're truly powerful when everyone has it in for you.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.290
Now, I do believe it's time for fifth period.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.710
Yes, sir.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.010
He doesn't understand.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.180
If you're everyone's assassination target,

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.470
that means they all acknowledge your power.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.230
A creature like that wouldn't understand what it's like

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.750
for no one to expect or fear anything from you,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.570
or even acknowledge your existence...

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.240
Thanks to you, my evaluation's in the gutter!

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.620
The only silver lining is I'll never have to see you again.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.920
I might just be able to kill him.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:26.520

All right, then,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.150
compose a short poem to go along with our theme.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.230
The final line should be "was tentacles all along."

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.320
Huh?

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.950
"Was tentacles all along"?

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:49.990
Indeed!

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.700
When you're finished, bring them to me.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.290
I'll be looking for proper grammar

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.040
and whether you've aptly conveyed the tentacle's beauty.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.750
An example:

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:07.760
Interpretation: A life lived vividly, powerfully, wasn't a blossom shower scattering cherry petals in the garden— it was tentacles.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.380
"Not the storm of garden's snow Or flowers moving on"

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.510
"But sprouting there instead Was tentacles all along."

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.470
We have to write it was tentacles? Really?

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.160
Once you're done, you're free to go home!

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.140
How are we gonna write about that?

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.360
Now, now...

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.350
Aren't any marvelously slithery phrases coming to mind?

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.950
Slither slither slither slither!

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.020
Enough with the slithering!

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.020
I have a question!

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.780
Yes, Kayano-san?

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.860
It feels weird to only ask this now, but... what's your name?

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.530
How else are we supposed to refer to you specifically?

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.950
My... name?

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.660
Now that you mention it... He never did tell us.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.440
Hmm... I don't really have the kind of name you tell people.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.800
Go ahead and give me one.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.960
You sure about that?

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.830
But right now, focus on your schoolwork.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:51.930
Yes, sir.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.270
Meanwhile, I'll just take a little break.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.060
Finished already, Nagisa-kun?

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.240
After lunch, right around the time we get sleepy,

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.540
his face sometimes goes light pink.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.500
He was a little slow responding to Kayano's question, too.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.380
That might be when he's at his most vulnerable.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.170
We prep-school failures are always thinking,

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.140
"We gotta get back at 'em somehow."

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.350
"We'll show our parents, friends, and teachers that we can do it if we try."

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.730
We can do it if we try.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.360
Didn't I tell you to be more inventive?

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.320
We have to prove ourselves...

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.540
by any means necessary.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.850
Hell yeah!

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.040
We did it!

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.960
Nagisa!
Ten billion yen! Cha-ching!

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.340
Serves you right!

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.150
Terasaka!
What have you done?!

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.340
Bet he never expected a suicide bomber!

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.010
Hey!

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.980
What'd you give Nagisa?!

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.720
Huh? A toy grenade.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.680
But I beefed it up with gunpowder

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.350
so it'd shoot three hundred anti-teacher bullets at crazy-high speed!

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.980
Nothin' strong enough to kill human beings, all right?

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.940
My ten billion yen'll cover his medical bills no prob—

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.410
He's not hurt? Not even a single burn?

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.840
And what's with this membrane?

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.000
It's attached to that octopus's corpse?
As it happens,

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.460
I shed my skin about once a month.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.420
I protected Nagisa-kun there by covering him with my old skin.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.670
It's my once-monthly ace-in-the-hole.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:02.250
Terasaka, Yoshida, Muramatsu.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.850
You don't have to look at the color of his face to know.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.580
Pitch black! He is furious!

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.610
You three... are responsible for this, aren't you?

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:20.870
N-No!

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.450
It was all Nagisa's idea!

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:29.880
He's gone!

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.960
The nameplates from our houses?!

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:41.480
My agreement with your government prohibits me from harming you.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:47.730
But if you try another assassination like that one...

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:52.650
I might just harm someone else.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.880
Your family, your friends...

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.490
Maybe I'll kill everyone on the planet except you.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.160
It only took five seconds for everyone to understand.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.000
Nowhere on this planet was safe.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.700
Our only escape from this situation...

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.170
was to kill him!

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.130
What the hell's your deal, anyway?

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.080
You're a real pain in the ass!

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.260
Showing up all "I'm gonna blow up the Earth" and "Assassinate me"!

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.140
What's wrong with using an annoying method to kill an annoying guy?!

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.100
Annoying? Hardly.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.850
Your idea itself was a very good one.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.860
Especially you, Nagisa-kun.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.800
The way you carried yourself so naturally on your approach gets full marks from me.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.780
You did an excellent job making it past my defenses.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.240
However!

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.740
None of you looked out for Nagisa-kun—

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.950
not even Nagisa-kun himself.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.460
Students like that aren't fit to assassinate anyone.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.300
We need an assassination worth smiling about—one to be proud of!

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.920
You're all capable assassins who have that power within you.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.890
Just a few words of advice from your teacher-cum-target.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.420
One moment we were being chewed out at Mach 20, and the next we were being praised with waving tentacles.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.500
It wasn't your average education,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.610
but it made me pretty happy.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:22.120
All because this unusual teacher was actually willing to look us in the eye.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.080
If you...

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.210
If you're willing to give up your time,

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.380
go teach those children.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.840
What splendid tentacles.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.860
With hands like these,

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.600
I'm sure you'll be a splendid teacher.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.350
Let me pose you a question, Nagisa-kun.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.310
I have not the slightest intention of being killed.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.470
I will enjoy my time with you all until next March,

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.530
and then I will blow up the Earth.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.990
If you don't like that idea, what do you plan to do about it?

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.700
We've never assassinated anyone before,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.910
and there's plenty of other stuff we should be doing.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.370
But, you know...

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.830
I think this teacher

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.710
might even accept us trying to kill him.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.300
Before you destroy Earth... I'll kill you.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.140
Then what are you waiting for?

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.780
Once you've killed me, you're free to go home!

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.790
Just like that, huh?

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.140
You know we can't kill you!

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.370
We are killers.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.690
The sun shines The sun shines taiyou ga sasu

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.980
taiyou ga sasu And our target...

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.690
is our teacher.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.680
Wipe, wipe, wipe it clean!

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:46.650
On the back of my closed eyelids
tozashita mabuta no uragawa ni

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.680
If we tried to shoot him now...

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.030
we'd just get polished like those nameplates.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.490
We're never getting out of here!

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.090
I see red afterimages I see red afterimages

With a notebook and a pen in my leather bag

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.440
"Korosenai" for "unkillable," and "sensei" for "teacher"...

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.290
Oh! What about "Korosensei"?

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.580
Korosensei?

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.750
I go for a walk I go for a walk saa arukidasou

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.090
So here we are with Korosensei...

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:07.250
I keep drawing, but I can't get it to look pretty
kaitemo kaitemo kirei ni naranai

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.050

The bell signals the start of another school day.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:12.610
My choice of colors is not to blame

Haiku and tanka are the major fixed verse forms representative of Japanese culture.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.480
A haiku consists of 17 syllables in a 5-7-5 pattern,

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.570
and a tanka consists of 31 syllables in a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.820
Nagisa-kun, haiku is the one that requires a seasonal reference!

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.580
Next time on Assassination Classroom: Baseball Time.
