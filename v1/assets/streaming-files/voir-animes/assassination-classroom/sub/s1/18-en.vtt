00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.270
Now, then...

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.730
What on Earth are you going to do, hmm?

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.320
First, you'll get to enjoy a video Mimura put together,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.240
and then the seven top testers will destroy your tentacles.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.830
That'll be the signal for us all to jump in and begin the assassination.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.370
Does that sound all right, Korosensei?

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.420
More than all right.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.840
Thanks for setting this up, Mimura.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.630
It was hard work! I was editing all through dinner.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.430
This chapel is surrounded by ocean,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.350
and there's a chance the walls and windows are treated with an anti-teacher substance.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.310
Escape would be too risky.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
I suppose I'll just have to dodge everything in here.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.860
Korosensei?

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.860
I have to pat you down first.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.600
We may be surrounded by water, but if you smuggled in that swimsuit,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.120
you'd still be able to get away.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.040
You're being so careful!

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.410
But I wouldn't pull such a cheap trick.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.880
This teacher can easily dodge my attacks, even at point-blank range.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.590
But...

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.800
If we all work together, this might be our chance!

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.590

Come right at me!

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.330
Here we go, Korosensei.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.660
AC...

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.130
Somewhere in Tokyo: Kunugigaoka Junior High, Class 3-E.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.260
As it happens, their teacher is also their assassination target.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.760
People are going in and out of this chapel in the dark behind me.
Tonight, the E Class recon team will close in

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.770
That would conceal the number of people and their positions.
on the ecology of this mystery man.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.310
But you underestimate me.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.680
I can tell two students' scents are missing.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.180
From that direction, I can smell the E Class's top snipers, Hayami-san and Chiba-kun.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.530
This video really is well done.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.850
You edited and narrated this, Mimura-kun?

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.150
Nice camera blocking, good music... Really sharp.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.040
It pulls me right—

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.550
Joining us today are those who shared top-secret intel with the recon team.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.300
Today's Target: Korosensei

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.840
We'll hear what they have to say... after this.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.680
His bribery... failed.
Tokyo resident Korosensei (age unknown)

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.270
It failed?!

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.770
His current preference is mature office women.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.280
Here are all the dirty magazines this octopus has gathered.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.190
No! Come on, Okajima-kun!

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.860
I told you guys not to tell anyone!

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.530
A giant shadow looms over the line for the women-only cake buffet.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.310
Who could it be?

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.830
It's him.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.040
I'm Koroko!

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.710
Excuse me, but this is for women only...
His disguise can't last long.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.370
What do you think you're doing?!

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.920
It's a miracle they found out he wasn't a woman without discovering he wasn't even human.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.260
Porn, cross-dressing, and not a hint of shame?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.470
What a dirty pervert.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.180
Take one!

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.510
When he's short before payday, Thanks!

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.350
this man lines up his images to get free tissues.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.430
Thanks!

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.350
Thanks!

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.180
And what does he do with them?
Thanks!

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.020
Fries them up and eats them.
Here we have fried pocket tissues!

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.690
I recently noticed they have quite a sweet taste to them,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.070
Has he no dignity as an educator—nay, as a living being?

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.070
and a pleasant spongy texture.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.280
And that's not all.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.950
We have a full hour of embarrassing footage of this instructor.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.160
Another hour of this?!

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.660
m 573 418.5 l 1312.5 418.5 1312.5 700.5 573 700.5
One Hour Later

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.710
I'm dead. I'm already dead.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.380
With all that out in the open... I can't go on living.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.800
The End The End The End The End

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.630
Now, did you happen to notice anything while you sat through our top-secret video,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.840
The End The End Korosensei?

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.850
The End

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.220
Water!

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.230
But I didn't sense anyone pouring it in!

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.100
It couldn't be... High tide!

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.530
Someone musta shortened the support pilings on this here chapel.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.610
Seasick, shamed, and now waterlogged...

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.240
You've slowed down quite a bit.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.210
Now for the main event...

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.460
A promise is a promise. No dodgin', now.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.720
A valiant effort. But I know where the snipers are.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.930
If I just keep an eye out in that direction...

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.010
Commence operation!

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.430
Begin!

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.640
Five seconds elapsed.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.910
Did it come apart?!

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.960
Yes!

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.130
Thirty-five seconds elapsed.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.010
Flyboards?

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.260
A hydraulic cage?!

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.930
Korosensei doesn't do well with sudden changes to his environment.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.140
From the chapel to a cage of water!

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.270
It'll confuse his weakened tentacles

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.350
and lower his reaction speed even further!

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.100
Fifty-three seconds elapsed.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.480
Commencing volley.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.440
Taking aim.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.530
Target area: one square meter around Korosensei.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.660
Korosensei is highly sensitive to attacks that make contact.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.040
But we're actually not going to aim at him!

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.290
We'll block his escape path with a hail of bullets!

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.330
And that's not all!

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.210
The final blow... goes to those two!

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.670
The ones onshore are two dummies infused with their scents!

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.630
By alerting him to the shore while in the chapel

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.090
and changing the setting to a water cage,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.680
we've created a whole new sniping target!

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.350
Game over!

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.730
You've done well... to come this far!

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.930
Nagisa!

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.640
This is clearly unlike any of our previous attempts—

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.600
it feels like it worked!

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.060
Stay alert!

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.190
He can regenerate!

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.860
Isogai-kun, Kataoka-san, you're in charge of watching the water!

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.030
Yes, sir!

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.450
But he had nowhere to run!

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.910
Look!

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.870
Hey... Uh-huh...

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.090
What the hell is that?

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.390
My trump card of all trump cards: my absolute defense form!

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.600
Absolute defense form?!

The energy remaining after shrinking my body down hardens in a shell around it.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.370
In this form, I'm absolutely invincible!

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.620
No way...

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.500
So if you always stay in that form, we can never kill you!

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.290

On the other hand, for the one day or so until this crystal decays,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.350
I can't move an inch.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.190
This brings with it certain risks.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.480
What happened to the thing I left here?!

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.650
I put it out with the trash.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.940
Oh, nooo!

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.320
What I'm most afraid of is being placed into a high-speed rocket during that time

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.580
and left to float through the far reaches of outer space.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.040
But I've thoroughly studied that eventuality.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.920
Nowhere in the world is there a rocket capable of making that flight within 24 hours.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.880
He got us.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.130
Another trick up his sleeve—after all that.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.570
And he even took its weak points into account!

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.800
That was an utter failure.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.060
Invincible, my ass.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.810
Somethin' like this has gotta be breakable somehow!

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.690
It's no use. Even a nuclear bomb wouldn't leave a scratch.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.770
Oh, I get it.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.480
No weaknesses means we're out of options.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.700
No! Stop! I can't cover my face without any hands!

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.620
Sorry, sorry! Then I'll just...

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.500
stick this sea slug on you!

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:54.460
Someone go find me a filthy old guy so I can jam this thing down his underpants!

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.130
No! Help!

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.340
When you think about it, we can do whatever we want with him.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.260
Yep. And this kind of thing is Karma-kun's specialty.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.010
We'll disperse for now, students.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.730
The top brass and I will discuss how to deal with this one.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.940
Going to throw me in a pool full of anti-teacher material?

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.320
It won't work.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.370
I can simply make a portion of my energy explode,

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.070
creating a blast like before that'd send things flying.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.700
But you should be proud.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.660
Even the world's combined military couldn't get this far with me.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.000
It all comes down to the magnificence of your plan.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.760
Korosensei praised our assassination like he always does,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.760
but it was our biggest disappointment yet.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.930
Still in shock from our all-in, full-throttle attack missing the mark,

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.650
coupled with an unusual sense of fatigue,

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.980
we made our way back to the hotel.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.090
Ritsu?

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:20.970
Yes?

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.680
You recorded that, right?

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:28.060
Yes! I captured as much of the assassination as possible with my high-speed camera.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.310
I knew the second I fired that I'd missed.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.560
That my bullet couldn't kill him.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.770
I can't say for sure.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.700
The exact time it took him to change into that form is unclear.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.950
However, if your shot had been 0.5 seconds faster,

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.370
or if Hayami-san's had been thirty centimeters closer,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.450
you would have had a fifty percent chance of killing him before he noticed.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.840
I was so confident. I mean, we rehearsed

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.550
and even practiced firing from a less stable spot—and I didn't miss.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:12.600
But when the time came, my fingers stiffened and my vision narrowed.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.520
Same here.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.060
The pressure of absolutely not being allowed to miss...

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.980
That crucial now-or-never moment...

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.030
To think it'd be this different from practice.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.660
I'm just so exhausted!

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.000
Let's head back to our room and rest.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.210
I don't feel like doing anything.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.500
What, one lousy miss and you lose all your energy?

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.210
We did what we were supposed to do, so tomorrow we can just enjoy ourselves!

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.300
Ooh, yeah! Tomorrow I get to take in some swimsuited beauties for sure!

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.260
No matter how tired I may be, I'll always have the energy for a hearty nosebleed!

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.390
Man, I'm just not feeling it.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.360
Something isn't right. Everyone's too exhausted!

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.520
Can I lean on you for a second, Nagisa-kun?

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.200
Nakamura-san!

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.140
I want to go back to the room and change,

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.170
but I can't seem to move my body at all.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.630
You're burning up!

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.010
Just imagining those babes is giving me a nosebleed!

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.430
Okajima-kun!

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.430

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.110
Hey! Where's the hospital on this island?

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.570
Well... I'm afraid the island is too small to have one.

Your precious students seem to be in a real bad way.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:03.840
Who is this?!

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.500
Hey, Ritsu!

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.970
Who I am doesn't matter.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.680
Those brats aren't the only ones going after that marked man.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.350
You mean you did this?

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.890
How observant.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.600

but the cells in their bodies will break down within a week,

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.820

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.410
There's only one remedy, also an original concoction,

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.960
but unfortunately, I'm the only one who has it.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.340
I can't be bothered bringing it to you, so you'd better come get it directly.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.880
There's a hotel atop this island's mountain.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.840
Bring me the one with the price on his head.

Come up to the top floor within one hour.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.100
However, Sensei, you seem pretty tough yourself. Dangerous, even.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:09.280
So send your two shortest students still standing—one boy, one girl.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.160
I've told the front desk to expect you.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.240
Follow the rules, and we'll swap the target for the remedy and that'll be that.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:25.250
But contact any outsider, or be even a little late, and the remedy...

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.210
will be history.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.260
I've got to thank you for immobilizing him like that.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.510

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.780
Karasuma-san?

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.410
As we expected, it's no use.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.880
Even when we play the government card,

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.450
the hotel just responds with claims of privacy protection.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.450
It figures.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:03.660
Does it?

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.920
That mountaintop hotel is a noted site for illegal negotiation.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.460
A remote island in the southern sea?

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.380
Couldn't ask for a better location.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.090
They have connections with some government higher-ups.

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.100
Even the police have their hands tied.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.640
Clearly they're not going to cooperate with us.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.440
What are we gonna do? At this rate, it'll be a massacre!

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.310
We didn't come here to be killed!

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:34.610
Calm down, Yoshida-kun. We won't die that easily.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.990
Just come up with a way to deal with this.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.030
Yeah... Sorry, Hara.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.080
It's too dicey to do what he says.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.750
Send your two runtiest students?

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.750
These two squirts?!

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.960
We'd just be handin' him hostages!

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.920
First off, I'm pissed at anyone who would even do this kinda thing.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.550
No one lays a finger on my flunkies!

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.510
That simple-minded guy... Heh heh...

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.140
I say we ignore his demands!

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.280
Let's get everyone to a hospital in the city!

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.980
I'm against that.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.570
If it really is an unknown artificial virus,

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.990
even the biggest hospitals won't have the antivirals to stop it.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.410
The time wasted in bringing in the sick could hurt them more.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.580
Say what?!

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.540
We'll work on treating the symptoms for now.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.000
You'd better hurry to the trade-off spot.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.460
Takebayashi...

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.170
There's nothing else we can do.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.220
If Korosensei could move, we might've had a chance.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.300
If only our assassination attempt hadn't gone quite so well for nothing.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.180
So he's the one they're after.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.310
I'm not sure that guy will just let the students go after they deliver him.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.810
What should we do? We only have one hour.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.650
There's still a way.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.570
Korosensei?

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.530
All set!

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.290
It looks like Ritsu-san's completed the prep work I asked her to do.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.210
I need the healthy students to come here.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.330
Wear something you don't mind getting dirty.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.560
It's so high...

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.730
I infiltrated the hotel's computers

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:40.900
and got schematics of the interior, complete with guard locations.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.740
A large number of guards are stationed at and around the main entrance.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.120
It's not possible to enter the hotel without going past the front desk.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.540
With one exception: there is an entryway on this side, atop the ledge.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.590
The terrain is impassable,

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.090
and there are no guards posted there.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.050
If you don't want the enemy to get his way...

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.110
there's only one thing to do!

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.520
Not counting the ten patients and the two left behind to care for them,

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.850
all capable students must sneak in from here,

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.610
get the jump on the guys at the top,

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.400
and steal that remedy!

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.260
Red makes her look shy or drunk, Red.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.950
and blue makes her look uneasy or unwell:

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.680
Blue.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.930
an extremely effective tactic when going undercover.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.560
When she tried to show this off to her students,

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.560
they accused her of being a cheap Korosensei ripoff.
Look at this!

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.730
I can change the color of my face!
She got angry, and her face went all red by itself.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.440
I didn't rip off anyone!

but they don't have cells, which form the basic unit of life.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.470
