Your second transfer student will arrive on 6/15.

There will be no need for an advance briefing;
simply comply with his attendant's wishes.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.240

All right, class, time for homeroom.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.930
Please take your seats.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.770
He seems... larger than life today.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.190
Korosensei, can you explain why your head is approximately thirty-three percent bigger?

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.850
Ah.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.190
It's soaked up lots of moisture thanks to the high humidity.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.440
Korosensei's Weak Point #14:
Prone to dampness What are you, uncooked rice?!

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.000
Now, then.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.450
I believe Karasuma-sensei told you another transfer student is coming.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.080
Yeah. Probably another assassin.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.620
I got into a spot of bother taking Ritsu-san too lightly last time.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.750
I won't make that mistake again.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.260
In any case, it'll be nice for you to have a new classmate.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.300
Hey, Ritsu, have you heard anything?

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.600
You know, as a fellow transfer assassin?

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.470
Yes, a little.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.680
Originally, he and I were to be introduced together.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.180
I would handle long-range attacks,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.310
and he, close-range combat.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.150
Together, we'd drive Korosensei into a corner.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.490
However, those orders were canceled for two reasons.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.530
Really? What were they?

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.620
Firstly, his adjustments took longer than expected.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.080
And secondly... I lack the capability to provide him support.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.300
As an assassin, I am overwhelmingly inferior to him.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.800
This coming from Ritsu, who blew off Korosensei's finger.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.390
What kind of monster is this guy?

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.280
What's with the outfit?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.910
Is that the new student?

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.170
Sorry. Didn't mean to frighten you.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.420
I'm not the new student. I'm his guardian.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.880
You can call me "Shiro," meaning "white."

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.050
Some guy all in white comes in doing tricks? That'd spook anyone!

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.140
Maybe not Korosensei, but—

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.390
Korosensei, you scaredy-cat!

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.860
He's spooked enough to use his liquefy trick!

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.060
Korosensei's Weak Point #15:
Gullible about rumors
Well, Ritsu-san was telling all those scary stories!

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.610
N-Nice to meet you, Shiro-san.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.530
And where is our new student?

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.990
It's a pleasure, Korosensei.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.500
He's a rather unique child, in personality and otherwise.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.460
I'll introduce him myself.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.340
He's awfully evasive.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.430
Yes?

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.180
Oh, just... You've got good kids here.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.520
I'm sure he'll fit right in.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.980
Now to introduce him:

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.890
Hey, Itona!

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.810
Come on in.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.910
I won.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.870
I proved that I'm stronger than that classroom wall.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.330
Use the damn door!

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.960
That's all that matters. That's all.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.340
We've got ourselves another handful!

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.840
Even Korosensei doesn't know how to react.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.300
He's not smiling... not serious...

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.430
What's with that half-assed expression?!

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.390
This is Horibe Itona. Please call him Itona.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.640
A white-clad guardian and a transfer student who's impossible to read.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.730
We're in for some extra-stormy weather.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.320
Say, Itona-kun, something's been bugging me.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.280
You came in from outside, right? Empty-handed?

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.530
It's raining buckets out there, and yet there's not a drop of it on you.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.590
You're probably the strongest one in this class.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.090
But don't fret.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.550
I have no interest in killing those weaker than me.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.550
The only ones I do want to kill...

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.270
are those who could be stronger than me.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.730
And in this classroom, Korosensei... Jelly of my jelly?

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.730
That's you.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.440
When you say "strong" and "weak," do you refer to fighting ability, Itona-kun?

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.110
In terms of strength, you and I are worlds apart.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.530
We're closer than you think.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.280
After all...

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.240
We're brothers by blood.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.670
B—

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.380
Brothers?!

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.210
The loser dies, Brother.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.860
Siblings have no need for cheap tricks.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.930
I will kill you and prove my strength.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.650
We face off after school. Here, in this classroom.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.900
Now hang on, Sensei! What's this "brother" stuff?!

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.320
Humans and octopuses are nothing alike!
No! No no no!

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.950
I haven't the foggiest! I was born and raised an only child!

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.330
When I asked my folks for a little brother,

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.160
So, to maintain our standard of living...
things got really awkward!

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.290
Wait, you have parents?!

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.790
Staff Room

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.460
Are they really siblings?

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.130
Or is this merely a tactic to shake him up?

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.970
Sorry to startle you, Karasuma-sensei.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.620
That boy's existence is the most classified of classified information.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.440
It wasn't unreasonable for you to be in the dark here.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.400
But I assure you: he is indeed Korosensei's brother.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.870
And after school, that will become extremely evident.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.540
He's puttin' away that candy like nobody's business.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.750
He's got Korosensei's sweet tooth, all right.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.500
Not to mention his unreadable expression.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.170
That brothers thing sure has everyone comparing the two of us.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.050
Now I'm all antsy.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.680
I'll cheer myself up by looking at the girly magazine I bought today.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.300
Ah, now this is for grown-up tastes!

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.770
They even like the same big boobs!

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.940
His credibility just skyrocketed!

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.310
Y-You think so, Okajima-kun?

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.520
Oh, yeah!

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.150
All boob lovers are brothers!

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.490
Three brothers now?!

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:37.710
If they really are brothers... then why wouldn't Korosensei know?

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.490
I bet it went like this...

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:43.960
Your Highness,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.960
the enemy army is upon us!

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.710
Then I have no choice!

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.210
My sons!

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.050
You alone must live on!

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.970
Go on ahead, my brother!

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.430
This bridge is the last thing that stands between us and freedom!

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.350
Brother!

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.740
Never mind me! Just go!

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.400
My brother! Go forth and live!

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.570
And once they grew up, they began their destined battle

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.570
without realizing they were brothers!

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.570
Okay. But why's the little brother human?

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.160
Um, like... a mutation?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.200
You haven't explained the core issue here!

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.910
You gotta dig deeper on your character backgrounds, Fuwa-san.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.910
And your plot needs a lot more work!

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.880
There's more to a story than being realistic!

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.900
More realism!

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.520
They arranged their desks into a ring?

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.770
Yep. Like a real match.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.480
I've never heard of anyone going about an assassination like this.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.280
You must be sick of plain old assassinations, Korosensei.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.950
Shall we set a rule, then?

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.200
How about... "Stepping out of the ring means instant death."

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.410
What do you think?

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.540
The hell? As if the loser would ever keep their end of the bargain.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:13.880
No, for him to break a rule we all witnessed would damage our trust in him as a teacher.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.930
That kind of restriction works especially well with this guy.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.600
All right. I accept your rule.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.980
However, Itona-kun, hurting the spectators will also result in a loss.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.400
Very well. Start on my signal.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.360
Assassination...

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.070
begin!

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.450
Our eyes were all pinned to one spot—

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.370
and it wasn't our teacher's shorn-off arm.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.960
It can't be...

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.130
Tentacles?!

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.020
Itona-kun's hair...

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.610
is tentacles!

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:18.070
Oh, so that's how he stayed dry empty-handed in that rain—

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.610
he can bat away the drops with his tentacles.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.910
Where?

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.830
Where did you get those...

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.290
those tentacles?!

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.880
We're not obligated to tell you that, Korosensei.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.000
But this ought to have convinced you:

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.010
You have different parents and different upbringings,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.390
but you are nonetheless brothers.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.290
My, what a scary face you're making.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.180
Did you perhaps remember something unpleasant?

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.690
It would appear that you and I will need to have a little talk.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.950
Unfortunately, you'll be dead by then.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.450
Exposure to this pressure ray at close range

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.620
triggers dilatant behavior in your cells.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.930
Your whole body stiffens instantly.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.560
We know everything. All of your weak points.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.070
Did he get him?

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:19.630
No.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.550
Look up!

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.890
You've shed your skin?

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.850
That's right. You did have that trick up your sleeve.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.230
However, Korosensei,

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.310
we also know the downside of that process.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.520
Molting expends more energy than one would expect.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.400
m 0 0 l 1920 0 1920 1080 0 1080
Korosensei's Weak Point #16:
Vulnerable after molting Vulnerable after molting

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.400
Consequently, the speed you're so proud of drops immediately afterward.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.040
And you've grown back the arm that Itona took in his first surprise attack.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.580
m 0 0 l 1920 0 1920 1080 0 1080
Korosensei's Weak Point #17:
Vulnerable after regeneration
That uses up quite a bit of stamina as well.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:53.750
By my calculations, you should be evenly matched physically around now.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.420
Moreover, use of tentacles depends greatly on one's mental state.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.420
m 0 0 l 1920 0 1920 1080 0 1080
Korosensei's Weak Point #2:
Loses his composure rather easily.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.170
And when one considers the shock of being injured by an unexpected tentacle,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.220
it's obvious who's in the lead now.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.430
Furthermore,

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.310
he has the support of his devoted guardian.
m 0 0 l 1920 0 1920 1080 0 1080
Korosensei's Weak Point #18:
Hardens upon exposure to a special beam

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.780
Now you'll have to grow back your legs too.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.680
That'll drop your stamina even further, making you easier to kill.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.990
What a relief.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.460
Turns out I'm stronger than you, Brother.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.290
He's got Korosensei on the ropes.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.710
If they kill him... they'll save the world!

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.470
And yet... why am I so disappointed?

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.930
They're zeroing in on weak point after weak point as though they know his every move.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.310
But honestly?

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.100
We wanted to find those out for ourselves.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.610
And we wanted to kill him!

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.640
Your legs have regenerated, I see.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.450
Now, can you withstand the next onslaught?

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.590
This is the first time anyone's pressed me this hard.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.850
At first glance, it seemed like a straightforward face-off,

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.910
but it's all been so carefully calculated.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:24.480
There's a lot I'd like to ask you two, but I won't get a chance unless I win this first.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.130
You still think you can win?

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.130
The bluster of a cornered octopus, no more.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:33.350
There is one thing you forgot to take into account, Shiro-san.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:38.310
There is not. My methods are impeccable.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.270
Kill him.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.860
What's this?

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.370
You seem to have stepped on something.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:57.830
When did he...

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:06.380
If our tentacles are the same, then these anti-teacher knives should work the same too.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.340
And the loss of a tentacle unnerves us both.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.600
But I'm a little more seasoned than you.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.020
You should be unharmed, wrapped in my old skin like that.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.230
But your feet are outside the ring.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:32.240
I win. As per the rules, that means you die.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.910
You can't kill me anymore.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:41.260
If you want to live, stay with the other students of this class,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.460
and learn something that can't be measured just by crunching numbers:

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.170
the difference experience makes.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.540
I've lived a little longer than you, and come to know a little more.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.810
I became a teacher because I wanted to pass that on to you all.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.350
If you don't take my experience from me here in this classroom,

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.810
you'll never be able to beat me.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.150
I won't? I...

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.780
I'm weak?!

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.280
This isn't good. Itona absolutely despises studying.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.740
And lecturing a child who hates to study...

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.990
could result in genocide!

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.910
Black tentacles?!

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.670
Oh crap! He's gone off the deep end!

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.910
I'm strong. These tentacles made me stronger than all the rest.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.090
All the rest!

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.600
My apologies, Korosensei.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:44.470
It seems this boy wasn't yet mentally prepared for school.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.480
I know it's his first day and all, but he'll be taking a little break.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.530
Wait!

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.010
I can't just let that student go. I'm his teacher!

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.450
I shall look after him until he graduates!

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.030
And, Shiro-san... I have so very much to ask you.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.090
Sorry, but no. We're leaving.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.790
Or would you stop us by force?

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.630
Anti-teacher fibers. You literally cannot touch me.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.440
Don't worry. He'll be back before long.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.600
After all, March is just around the corner.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.060
I'll take on the task of tutoring him at home.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:35.110
His personality will keep him from escaping that school before the Earth's destruction.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.860
And that class...

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.280
How interesting.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.000
They're so unpredictable, like today's sudden bursts of rain.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.790
Oh, how mortifying!

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:55.430
Embarrassed Embarrassed Embarrassed Embarrassed

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.010
What's with Korosensei?

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.050
Embarrassed Embarrassed

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.340
Dunno. He's been like that for a while now.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.800
I'm ashamed to have participated in such a serious development.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.160
I'm far more suited to comic relief!

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.250
So you know!

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.270
You sure got good and mad.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.730
Where did you get those... those tentacles?!

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.270
Oh, please don't say that, Hazama-san!

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.690
Just hearing those words again makes me want to run for the hills!

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.430
I'm the evasive airhead type! That's my selling point!

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.820
Showing my serious side will just ruin my characterization!

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.200
Korosensei's Weak Point #19:
Gets embarrassed in the aftermath of serious scenes
It ticks me off that you're deliberately managing your character.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.870
It's so embarrassing!
Still, that was quite a surprise.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.160
Who'd have thought that Itona boy would have tentacles?

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.790
C'mon, Korosensei, tell us.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.640
How are you linked to those two?

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.480
You've always dodged questions about your true form...

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.380
But seeing that really got us wondering.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.520
Yeah! We're your students, aren't we?

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.480
Don't we have the right to know a bit more about our teacher?

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:49.020
Then I suppose I'll have to tell you the truth.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.480
The truth is...

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.530
I'm an artificial lifeform!

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.340
Well, duh.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.490
And?

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:01.660
What kind of a reaction is that?!

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.460
Wasn't it a shocking revelation?

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.560
Well, like, no natural-born octopus can move at Mach 20.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.790
And if you're not an alien, that's about the only explanation left.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.620
Plus, if Itona-kun said he was your younger brother,

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.320
he must have meant he was created after you were.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.930
They're too sharp for me! What frightening children!

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.400
We want to know what happened after that, Korosensei.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.560
Why did you get so angry when you saw Itona-kun's tentacles?

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.770
Why were you created,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.190
and why did you decide to come here?

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.490
Sorry, but I'm afraid there's no point in telling you that now.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:46.950
If I destroy the Earth, everything you want to know will be as dust in the wind.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.730
On the other hand, if you can save the Earth,

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.250
you'll have plenty of opportunities to learn the truth.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:58.940
If you want to know more, understand that there's only one thing you can do:

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.010
kill me.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:06.970
Assassin and target. Those are the ties that bind us together.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.820
If you're looking for answers to the big questions from me,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.940
the only way you can get them is through assassinations.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.110
If there are no further questions, then we're done for the day.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.860
See you tomorrow.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.700
Oh, how mortifying!

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.070
Embarrassed Embarrassed Embarrassed Embarrassed

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:25.070
Embarrassed Embarrassed

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.790
We are killers. We search for answers with knife and gun.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:34.460
I'm so, so embarrassed!
Our target is our teacher—his life, our question.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.710
Oh, I wish I could just disappear!

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.770
Yes, the students are unhurt. Make preparations for repairs.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.090
Karasuma-sensei!

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.700
What brings all of you here? Quite the crowd, I see.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.890
Um... Can you teach us more assassination skills?

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.850
More than you already know?

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.590
We always figured somebody would wind up killing Korosensei,

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.490
so we didn't take it that seriously ourselves.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.070
Yeah, but when we saw Itona, we realized...

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.780
We don't want it to be just anyone. We want to kill him ourselves.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.610
If they bring in another tough assassin,

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.280
we'll lose track of what all our hard work has been for.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:21.300
So we want to kill our teacher the best we can in the time we have left.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.260
We want to kill him and find the answers for ourselves.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.770
What a change in attitude.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:29.940
Excellent.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:35.710
All right. Interested students can stay after class for extra training.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.200
It won't be easy.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.400
Yes, sir!

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.620
The sun shines The sun shines taiyou ga sasu

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.380
Let's start with some climbing on our new rope!

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:46.580
On the back of my closed eyelids

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.860

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.610
Begin!

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.320
Class 3-E at Kunugigaoka Junior High is the assassination classroom.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.370
Okay, next!

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.320
Like that'll work.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.020
I see red afterimages I see red afterimages

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.700

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.800
The rain has let up, and tomorrow the bell will signal the start of another school day.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:55.790

Nagisa-kun, Minamoto no Yoritomo and Minamoto no Yoshitsune are among the history's most famous brothers.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.520
Yoshitsune greatly contributed to his clan's victory, but he ended up committing suicide after opposing Yoritomo.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.110
Yoshitsune's tragic life served as a basis for many tales.
