00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.940
The rainy season's finally over!

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.400
It's starting to get hot.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.610
This is the season for outdoor activities.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.120
How about we go have fun somewhere outside?

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.840
Sure! What do you want to do?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.780
How about fishing?

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.780
Sounds good.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.620
What's there to catch right now?

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.200
Summer's the season for fresh delinquents.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:27.250
Top fishing spots for in-season delinquents are in front of convenience stores, gaming arcades, and diners late at night. They can often be found in groups, so bountiful catches are not unusual. Now, let's go fishing!

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.870
Let's use Nagisa-kun as bait and see if we can hook a few!

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.870
Big haul! Big haul!

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.250
I never knew delinquents were seasonal.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.550
What should we do?

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.710
What do you feel like, Nagisa?

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.170
Let's see... Oh, how about the beach?

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.170
The beach, huh?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.010
Nice pitch, Captain!

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.980
Well, if it isn't Sugino!

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.310
Long time no see.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.980
For real?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.030
Hey, it's you!
Sugino!

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.690
Hello!
Hey!

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.610
Hey, Sugino!

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.820
What gives? You should come say hi once in a while.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.860
Nah, it'd be kind of awkward.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.490
You're pitching in next week's ball game tournament, right?

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.000
Oh, I guess it hasn't been decided yet, but I'd like to.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.430
We'll be looking forward to it!

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.290
Sure thing!

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.750
But man, I envy you, Sugino.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.840
You're in the E Class, so you get to goof off every day.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.190
We've got schoolwork and practice, so we're running on fumes.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.720
Knock it off. That's not fair.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.280
Only the chosen few can be expected to juggle both schoolwork and extracurriculars at a prep school.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.270
Wow, that's incredible.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.690
So I suppose you're one of those chosen few, huh?

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.520
That's right, I am.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.650
Don't like it?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.320
Then how about we show you at the tournament?

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.530
There are those chosen to stand at the top, and then there's everyone else.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.370
You'll see that there's already a whole world of difference between us.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.610

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.400
for the wonderful reason that it'd leave us with an odd number of teams.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.030

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.490

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.450
while the whole school watches.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.620

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.540
Yep.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.960

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.800
Sheesh.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.180
You're the baseball expert here, Sugino.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.140
Got any secrets we can use to win?

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.520
It's impossible.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.230
Our baseball team is pretty strong.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.560
Especially Shindou, the current team captain.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.280
His explosive fastball has even caught the eye of prestigious high schools.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.240
A star pupil and a star athlete... It's unfair.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.200
But, you know...

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.330
I want to win, Korosensei.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.080
Not just put up a good fight. Win.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.870
I don't want to lose at the sport I love.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.840
After getting kicked out of the baseball team and coming to the E Class,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.050
my feelings have actually only grown stronger.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.260
I want to team up with these guys and win—

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.220
Oh, I'm so excited! So excited!

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.470
R-Right. You want to play baseball too.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.850
I hear you loud and clear.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.810
I've always wanted to be the fiery coach in a sports drama.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.400
I won't smack you kids around or anything. Instead, I'll flip dinner tables.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.860
You're way too prepared!

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.660
Lately, you've grown more articulate about the direction you want to go in.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.700
"I want to kill."

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.740
"I want to win."

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.700
Unwavering, no matter the adversity you face.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.170
To reward that spirit, Coach Koro will impart upon you the training and strategy you need to win!

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.710
Whoa-oh! A deep flyball!

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.630
The center fielder catches it with ease!

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.840
This one's over, folks!

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.800
The winner of the Year 3 Baseball Tournament is A Class!

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.120
Aw, man, we lost.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.140
Let's watch the next game to put this behind us.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.360
Can't wait to see some guys less talented than us suffering an even worse humiliation!

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.730
And now, lastly,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.070
we have the exhibition match between Class 3-E and the baseball team.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.700
Only the elite with both scholastic and athletic ability

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.870
can stand above others as one of the chosen.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.620
That's what it means to excel at both pen and sword.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.000
You excelled at neither.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.670
No one chose you.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.670
Let's play a tight game!

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.800
Yeah!

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.760
Whoa, why're they so fired up?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.970
Come to think of it, where's Coach Koro?

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.430
I thought he was giving us directions.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.760
Over there.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.100
Karasuma-sensei told him not to draw attention to himself,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.350
so he's using forced perspective to look like one of the balls.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.520
He said he'll give us signs with his face color and stuff.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.810
That's gonna give him away!

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.190
One! Two! Three!

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.780
What'd he say?

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.240
Hey there, Sensei!

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.820
Let's see... He said, "Show no mercy. Go for blood."

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.370
Yeah. Our real target is much more formidable.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.290
If we can't win against those chumps,

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.710
we'll never be able to kill our teacher.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.460
All right!

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.590
Let's kill it!

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.670
Yeah!

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.300
Now, let us give them a taste of baseball from hell,

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.890
infused with murderous intent and tentacles!

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.350
It's the top of the first inning.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.550
E Class on the offensive.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.100
Leading off, the third baseman, Kimura!

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.060
Strike!

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.060
But man, that super-junior high pitch sure is fast.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.100
Amazing! That's pitcher Shindou-kun's famous fastball in action!

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.060
I hear he gets up to 140 kilos per hour.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.020
It's got E Class's Kimura petrified!
What?! 140?!

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.480
At least swing that bat if you don't want to look like a loser!
That's right up there with the pros!

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.990
Man, it totally feels like we're a visiting team.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.450
One! Two! Three!

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.530
Roger that.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.200
All right! Here we go!

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.700
Whoa, the batter's plenty fired up!

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.080
Baseball Team Coach Terai Kiyoshi Baseball Team Coach
Baseball Team Coach Terai Kiyoshi Terai Kiyoshi
We'll get a 1-2-3 inning in the top of the first

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.960
and in the bottom, we'll score ten runs and get the game called.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.210
You're a nobody.
Now, here's Shindou-kun, with his second pitch.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.670
And he throws!

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.210
What?!

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.800
Whoa! He's bunting for a hit!

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.840
Kimura-kun's the fastest runner in the E Class.
He got a nice roll on that one!

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.850
As long as we catch them by surprise, he should easily make it to first base.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.060
He's safe! This is unbelievable!
Yes!

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.520
E Class, no outs, with a runner on first!
Damn! Sneaky bastard...

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.230
Batting second, the catcher, Shiota-kun.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.600
One! Two! Three!

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.270
Whoa! A push bunt!

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.270
Damn it!

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.490
The corners were in, but it gets past third for a base hit!

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.490
They may be tough, but they're still junior high kids.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.240
They can't handle bunts the way pros can.
Shindou goes to cover him and picks up the ball, but...

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.660
Aw! He's got nowhere to throw it!

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.700
Unbelievable! Runners on first and second with nobody out!

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.540
Wh-What?!

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.870
H-Hey... This game is starting to go in a weird direction.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.080
Impossible!

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.880
Getting a fastball like Shindou's to go where you want it to is virtually impossible.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.670
Hah! How do you like that?
Batting third, the shortstop, Isogai-kun.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.550
We've been practicing against that thing.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.260
Pitcher Koro throws 300-kilometer-per-hour pitches!

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.390
Infielder Koro lays down an impregnable defense of afterimages!

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.390
Please, you get it.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.180
Oh, no, please, you get it.
Will you make it in time?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.060
Catcher Koro destroys your focus by whispering trash talk.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.610
What happened to all that enthusiasm you had for secret air guitar behind the school, Mimura-kun?

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.610
I can't take anymore.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.070
Next up, we study our opponents.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:37.160
I had Takebayashi-kun spend the last three days spying on them.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.530
It was a pain.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.250
Shindou's pitches top out at 140.5 kilometers per hour.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.370
He only has a fastball and a curve.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.400
Even during practice matches, 90% of his pitches were fastballs.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.000
His fastball's so good,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.590
it's all he needs to win at the junior high level.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.380
Indeed. Or in other words,

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.970
we've got this in the bag as long as we have that fastball down pat.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.640
So! For our practice from here on out,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.890
I'll throw the same pitches Shindou-kun throws with the exact same form,

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.650
just as slow as he does.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.770
After seeing those pitches from me earlier,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.650
his will look like they're barely moving at all.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.660
Whoa! And another bunt!

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.030
Therefore, if it's just bunts, it's possible to become amply proficient.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.370
Right along the third base line!

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.990
F-Fair ball!

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.540
It's come to a dead stop right on the line!

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.670
Isogai makes it on base safely!

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.210
Th-The bases are loaded!

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.750
The bases are loaded with nobody out!

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.210
M-Maybe Shindou-kun's not feeling well or something?

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.880
Batting fourth, the pitcher, Sugino-kun.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.550
Sugino!

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.470
One! Two! Three!

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:43.850
Play ball!

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.060
Now, the game resumes.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.980
Uh-oh! He's shaping up to bunt too!

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.770
Wha... What is this?

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.980
What's up with these guys?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.610
Is what I'm playing right now...

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.740
really baseball?

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.240
Yes, in terms of sheer power, I'm no match for you.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.960
But with a well-aimed strike, even the weak

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.000
can take on a gigantic powerhouse and...

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.790
...bring it down!

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.380
He hit it!

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.840
Line drive into right center field!
Third! Third! Third base!

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.170
Shiota comes in to score,
Second baseman, go left! Left!

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.130
and now Isogai's rounding third as well!

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.390
N-No way...

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.930
The hitter Sugino makes it all the way to third!

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.100
He's cleared the bases with a three-RBI triple!
All right!

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.850

You look rather pale, Terai-sensei.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.900
It appears the baseball team is calling a timeout.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.570
It looks like they're all huddling on the mound, infielders and outfielders alike.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.570
Perhaps you are not feeling well.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.280
You should get some rest right away.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.910
I'm concerned the team members' worry for you might be affecting their play.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.700
S-Sir! N-No, as you can see, I am perfectly—

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.370
I am glad to find you unwell.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.540
For severe illness...

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:56.630
is the only reason any instructor employed by my school would perform so disgracefully.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.630
Ah, as I thought, he has a terrible fever.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.550
Please take Terai-sensei to the nurse's office.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.180
Yes, sir!

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.520
I shall serve as coach in the interim.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.680
Wh-What are you...

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.230
Not to worry.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.470
I will simply teach them a lesson of my own.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.950
Man! That was too bad.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.780
Yeah. We'll get them next time!

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.910
I'm sorry. I was the one who dragged us down.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.370
That's not true.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.500
Don't worry about it.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.830
When I saw the bouncing boobs on those basketball players,

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.630
the rage and bloodlust just made me see red and I...

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.300
What's with your animosity toward big boobs?!

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.840
Well, I mean...

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.470
Now, then.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.050
I wonder how the boys are doing.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.720
Mr. Principal...

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.940
Top of the first inning and the final boss already makes his appearance?

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.730
A-According to the information I just received,

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.030
Terai-sensei, the coach of the baseball team, had been gravely ill since before the match began!

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.490
Apparently, the players were so worried for their teacher that their hearts were not in the game!

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.990
The principal could not simply stand by and do nothing,

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.120
so it appears he will be taking charge immediately!

Wh-What in the world is this?!

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.130
They've brought the infield and outfield in!

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.050
I have never seen the entire defense moved in like this!
They know that all we've got is the bunt.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.470
But they can't do that, right?

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.840
Getting up close like that?

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.850
According to the rules, the defense can be positioned anywhere within the field of play.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.680
If the umpire made a call against it, that'd be a different story,

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.360
but the teacher acting as umpire is on their side.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.480
We can't expect anything from him.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.440
Now, let's reset the flow of this game.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.320
This Sugino-kun from the E Class...

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.190
It seems he joined a municipal baseball club.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.150
In his own way, he's making an effort.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.990
But what of it?

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.120
Everyone makes an effort.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.520
Chosen people such as yourselves have a destiny.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:13:00.340
In the life ahead of you, you'll have to trample hundreds— even thousands—of people like him in order to get ahead.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.920
You would be better off not thinking of this as baseball.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.090
This is simply an operation where you trample a mere ten of those thousands.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.390
Now, let us begin this operation.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.600
Ouch!

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.060
He popped it up!

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.520
Has the pressure of the infielders gotten to Maehara?!

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.480
That's one out now!

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.900
Batting sixth, the center fielder, Okajima-kun.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.690
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.620
You can't get by that with a bunt!

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.360
What're we gonna do, Coach Koro?!

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.990
One! Two! Three!

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.490
There's nothing else we can do?!

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.330
Strike three! Yer out!

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.160
Strike three! Yer out!

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.830
Three outs!
And just like that, the inning is over!

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.040
The pitcher, Shindou-kun, is back in the groove!

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.090
Keep it up, Shindou-kun.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.430
All you have to do is throw four-seam fastballs.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.470
Use a big windup and intimidate them with your pitches.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.300
Yes, sir!

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.220
And I will say this again to all of you.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.310
This is not baseball.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.810
This is the operation of unilaterally gaining ascendancy.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:55.640
Yes, sir!

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.100
We're gonna turn this around!

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.020
Yeah!

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.570
He, too, is masterful at educating his students.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.400
He has a good memory of his students' faces and their talents,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.990
and he's exceptional at teaching and motivating them.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.120
His methods are very similar to those of someone else I know...

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.250
and yet, how can the two of them be so different as educators?

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.000
Come on, inspiration! Come on, inspiration!

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.750
The contest of leadership between these two...

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.710
I'm a little interested to see how it goes.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.090
I get it now, Karasuma!

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.710
In other words, you take ball and stick in hand,

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.670
Leading off the inning, the left fielder, Hashimoto-kun.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.420
Play ball!

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.130
Sugino of E Class, first pitch.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:29.800
And he throws.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.260
Whoa!

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.470
Strike!
Awesome breaking ball!
Holy smokes!

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.370
Don't pitch to contact, Sugino.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.100
I'm not sure any of us can field the ball if it comes our way.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.020
I know.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.060
Try repeating after me.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.230
"I am strong."

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.030
"I will wind up big and throw."

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.570
I am strong.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.740
I will wind up big and throw.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.700
"I will overpower them."

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.450
I will overpower them.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.870
"I will trample them."

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.080
I will trample them.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.460
U-Unbelievable! He's struck out two in a row!
Karma-kun.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.580
Don't show up right at my feet, Coach Koro.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.840
You looking to get stepped on?

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.710
You're leading off the next innings.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.380
How about we try shaking things up with some provocation from you?

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.050
Now, top of the second inning!

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.350
Still going with the impregnable bunt defense!

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.100
Batting eighth, the left fielder, Akabane-kun.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.930
What are you doing?

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.850
Hurry up and get in the batter's box.
Hey!

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.060
Isn't this playing dirty, Mr. Principal?

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.320
They're taking up defensive positions that clutter up the field

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.790
and the umpire hasn't given them any warnings.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.490
Don't you guys think it's weird too?

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.780
Oh, I get it.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.250
You guys aren't the brightest, so you don't understand defensive positions and such, do you?

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.580
Quit whining about the little things, E Class!

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.080
It's an exhibition game!

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.790
Quit trying to dispute the defense!

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.380
If you've got a problem, then show us you can produce real results!
Don't think it's working, Coach.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.170
That's perfectly fine.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.340
The important thing is to speak out and protest loud and clear.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.840
E Class Baseball Team E Class Baseball Team
Top of the second inning, E Class helplessly goes down in order!

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:57.890
He hit it!
It's flat!

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.230
It smacked right into the wall!

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.350
Uh-oh! He couldn't catch it off the bounce!

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.150
Nice hit!

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.350
Shindou-kun makes it to second with room to spare!

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.270
It's a double!

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:10.070
Thank you, Korosensei, for helping me educate them.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.280
The weak, who try to win using nothing but cheap tricks,

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.480
and the overwhelmingly strong, who easily overpower them in any event.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.980
Hashimoto-kun.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.710
Yes, sir!

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.010
Show them how it is done.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.550
Whoa! A drag bunt!

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.890
It's the E Class's turn to see their share of hell!

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.430
Damn it!

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.600
E Class, this is how bunting is done!

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.350
Sorry.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.600
It's all good.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.940
The baseball team bunting against amateurs...

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.190
In most cases, even the students watching would consider it unacceptable,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.190
And again, a bunt!

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:53.360
but your using it first provided us with valid justification:

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.570
Damn it!

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.370
to show you how it is really done.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.490
No outs and bases loaded!

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.030
And the batter that's up...

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.550
is our school's superstar! Our pride and joy!

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.460
It's Shindou-kun!

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.540
I'll trample you, Sugino!

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.760
I've been preparing him ever since the first inning

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.600
to ensure this would happen at the very end.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.140
It will not be a bunt that clinches this game,

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.970
but the mighty swing of our star player.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.020
Now, what hand will you play,

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.020
homeroom teacher to these assassins?

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.770
Karma-kun.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.980
The time has come to put your earlier provocation to good use.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.930
Oh, I get it now.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.860
I think we have no choice but to walk Shindou.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.780
Hey, instructions from the coach.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.740
Now, the game resumes... with...

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.080
a-an unusually tight defense!

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.290
We're clearly defending in positions that would disrupt the batter's focus,

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.550
but I didn't hear any objections from the umpire when you guys did it earlier.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.260
You've got no problem with this, right, Principal?

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.340
I see now.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.800
You have thought this through, but that is just a clever trick.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.890
Feel free.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.230
Mere changes in defense will not faze the chosen.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.020
Wow, big words.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.350
Then we'll do just that.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.280
T-Talk about close!

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.530
Forget about tight defense! This is point-blank!

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.070
He could hit them with his swing at that distance!

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.660
Don't mind us. Just swing away, superstar.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.040
We won't get in the way of the pitch.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.290
A worthless bluff.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.870
Swing away without a care, Shindou-kun.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.250
Even if you break some bones,

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.050
it will be E Class that gets penalized for obstructing the batter.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.760
They think they can make fun of me, huh?

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.880
If I swing big and scare them,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.840
they'll back down for sure!

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.510
Strike!

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.680
They moved just enough to dodge him, and no more.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.110
Their nerves of steel and dynamic visual acuity top the E Class.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:56.070
Simply dodging the bat is easier than bunting for them.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.280
A slow swing like that won't cut it.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.240
Next time,

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.950
try swinging like you mean to kill us.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.370
At this point,

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.040
Shindou-kun could no longer physically keep up with the principal's strategy.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.460
Both the runners and the crowd

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.940
were overwhelmed by this bizarre spectacle masquerading as baseball.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.260
Nagisa-kun!

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.600
Third base!

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.470
Out!

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.180
Kimura! First base next!

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.350
The runner hasn't run, so no rush!

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.140
Roger that!

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.440
Out!

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.690
A t-triple play... Game over!

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.110
Unbelievable... Unbelievable... The E Class has...

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.320
won against the baseball team!

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.450
You boys are awesome!

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.320
They did it!

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.530
What the hell? That sucked!

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.200
The baseball team lost to those E-Class nobodies!

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.540
Who the hell loses with that kinda difference in firepower?!

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.210
The people who were watching probably have no way of knowing

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.500
about the numerous strategies

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.010
that the two coaches pitted against each other behind the scenes.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.930
Between this and midterms, I'd say I'm at one win and one loss.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.680
We'll settle this with the upcoming final exams.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.270
Shindou.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.520
Sorry for turning it into such a crazy game.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.270
But I know.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.230
You're a way better baseball player than I am.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.450
I don't consider this a victory over you or anything.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.540
Then... Why did you go to all this trouble to win?

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.960
Weren't you trying to produce real results to show that you're stronger than me?

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.380
Nagisa always keeps me company when I'm practicing my breaking balls.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:45.510
Not to mention, Karma and Isogai's reflexes, our skill at bunting, and all that was pretty cool, right?

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.650
Show off my current friends to my old friends.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.440
You remember this, Sugino:

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.610
we'll play again in high school!

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.490
You got it!

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.580
If the Earth's still here by then, that is.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.490
What's wrong?

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.160

Mach 20 is approximately 6800 meters per second.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.690
One lap around the baseball diamond is about 110 meters long.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.250
So the time it takes me to run one lap around the baseball diamond would be,

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.320
using the formula time equals distance divided by speed,

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.560
about 0.016 second, Sugino-kun.
