00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.500
That was one fun school trip.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.230
But now it's all back to normal.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.030
You call this normal?

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.820
Yo!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.080
Hey!

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.560
Morning, Isogai-kun.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.370
Did you guys see that group email from Karasuma-sensei?

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.870
Yep.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.040
It was about a transfer student, right?

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.260
Karasuma-sensei Students
A transfer student will be joining you tomorrow. Their looks may surprise you, but try not to make a big deal out of it. Karasuma
Hmm. Sounds like another pro killer to me.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.600
So now they're bringing in student assassins.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.100
If they're a transfer student... Middle-Aged

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.100
Middle-Aged Middle-Aged Middle-Aged Middle-Aged
maybe they'll be our age, not like Bitch-sensei!

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.320
On that note... Where'd you come from?!

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.080
I was curious too, so I asked Karasuma if he had a photo.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.900
Here's what he sent back!

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.000
Oh! A girl!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.580
You made it your wallpaper, huh?

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.940
She's pretty cute!

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.360
Right? Super cute!

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.610
Oh man, I sure hope we hit it off!

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.450
She doesn't look like a killer.
I'm so... I'm so nervous!

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.780
Yeah.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.160
Please let us hit it off!
Dial it down a notch, Okajima.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.110
Assassin or not, any new student is always met with a mix of anticipation and unease.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.290
What's she like? What's her assassination style?

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.300
We were brimming with curiosity.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.760
I wonder if she's here yet.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.700
You know, the new girl.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.690
The hell's this?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.840

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.160
One of them is already dead.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.240
But how's it going to attack?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.700
The other two appear to get along well with one another.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.490
How's what?

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.330
They call it a fixed artillery, but then where are the guns?

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.080
Ira comes to visit the sick Kajii almost every day.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.370
Hmm... Maybe—

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.460
But is this really out of concern for Kajii?

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.680
I knew it!
Wow!

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.850
Four shotguns

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.310
and two machine guns.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.370
That's a veritable cascade of bullets,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.430
but it's just what I've come to expect from my students.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.690
And discharging firearms during class is prohibited for safety reasons.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.830
I will be careful. Preparing to attack.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.820
Now we'll see what she's made of.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.040
She has the ability to evolve, you see.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.830
Recalculating trajectory. Correcting angle.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.000
Entering auto-evolution phase 5/28/02.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.960
Tsk, tsk. Will you ever learn?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.130
This attack is identical to the first!

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.840
Just what I'd expect from a machine.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.430
Given that, I need only utilize my chalk the same way as before, and...

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.570
A blind spot!

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.860
A hidden pellet...

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.120
The second pellet flew along the same trajectory as the one I blocked, hiding it from my sight!

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.740
Left fingertip destroyed.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.210
The newly added secondary gun has proven effective.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.000
She improves her weapons and program every time she learns part of her target's defense patterns,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.920
gradually closing in on her foe.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.430
Probability of killing you with the next attack:

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.930
less than 0.001 percent.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.510
Probability of killing you with the attack after that:

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.390
less than 0.003 percent.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.640
Probability of killing you before graduation:

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.850
greater than 90 percent.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.570
Now then, Korosensei:

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.780
resuming attack phase.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.330
Near misses: two.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.540
Confirmed hit.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.000
To calculate projected estimates,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.910
now adding four main guns

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.380
and resuming attack.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.300
We sure underestimated her.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.210
Or rather...

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.420
We didn't see her for what she was.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.180
There before our eyes was an honest-to-goodness killer!

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.350
An auto-evolving fixed artillery. Imagine that.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:05.190
She's shooting BB pellets right now, but that's cutting-edge military tech in there.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.070
Surely this will do the trick.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.320
You think it'll be that easy?

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.200
If it were that cut-and-dried, I wouldn't be teaching here.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.870
So...

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.380
We have to clean all this up?

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.880
You wouldn't happen to come with a vacuum, eh, Fixed Artillery-san?

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.010
Tch. The cold shoulder, huh?

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.470
Give it up. What's the point in teasing a machine?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.180
Second period.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.190
Second Period Second Period Third period.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.900
Third Period Third Period

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.370
The mechanized transfer student's attacks continued all day long.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.280
And the next morning...

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.540
8:29 and 35 seconds AM. All systems go.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.660
Power-supply voltage: stable.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.680
Operating system: normal.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.460
Recording disk: normal.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.280
Various devices: normal.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.710
No unnecessary elements found.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.190
Program: start.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.890
Verifying tasks. Today's plans: attack per 215 before sixth period,

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.270
continue analyzing target's evasion patterns...

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.230
Korosensei, I cannot deploy my guns like this.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.430
Please remove my restraints.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.310
Well, I don't know about that.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.950
Is this your doing?

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:41.620
It is clearly harming me, which is in violation of your agreement.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.830
Think again.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.960
It was me.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.130
You're a pain in the ass any way you look at it.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.960
Learn some common sense before you start firin' away, you box of bolts.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.220
Machines don't know what common sense even is!

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.090
We'll release you once class is over.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.220
That's how it is. If we keep getting repeats of yesterday,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.230
we'll never learn anything.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.440
Autonomously Thinking Fixed Artillery to Master:

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.980
Could not execute expected tasks on day two due to unforeseen issues.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.660
Probability of correcting problem on my own: zero percent.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.620
Probability of assassination by given deadline of graduation

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.450
may drop considerably.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.040
Requesting immediate countermeasures.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.580
Now, now. Don't rely on your parents.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:33.760
I can't really say the tactics they programmed you with are a good fit for this classroom.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.880
More importantly, you're a student, and a transfer student at that.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.310
You should try to come up with ways to get along with your classmates on your own.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.390
Get along?

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:47.230
Do you know why the students are interfering with your assassination?

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.770
As they see it, your attacks disrupt class—

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.030
and if you did happen to kill me,

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.780
the prize money would probably all go to your parents.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.040
Your assassination has no upside for them at all.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.090
Now I understand, Korosensei.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.640
I had not considered my classmates' interests.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.500
You are a smart one.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.380
Here. I made this for you.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:23.310
Some apps and some extra RAM. All virus-free, so please accept it.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.610
What is this?

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:34.150
Simulation software for working with your classmates as you attack.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.740
You can see how it will boost your assassination success rate.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.990
No objection.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.700
I think you understand now how vital cooperation is to assassination.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.450
Well? You'd like to get along with the others, right?

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.670
I do not know how.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.000
As you can see, I came prepared!

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.550
What is that?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.380
All the software you need for cooperation... and the additional RAM it will require.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.870
Harming you might be against the rules,

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.100
but there's nothing in there about increasing your capabilities.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.810
Good morning.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.370
Why are you doing this?

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.610
These upgrades will only shorten your life expectancy.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.860
I'm your teacher first, and your target second.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.780
Yesterday was all it took for me to understand

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.830
that both your ability and desire to learn are extremely high.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.370
Your parents gave you that gift,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:33.290
and it's my job as your teacher to develop it.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:38.130
Learn to work with your classmates, and develop your gifts even further.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.170
Korosensei,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.120
is this Desserts of the World Checklist necessary for cooperation?

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.580
I, uh... I was hoping you might be able to help me with that.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.230
Too sweet a deal?

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.860
Hey... You think she's still gonna be here today?

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.150
Probably.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.490
We gotta complain to Karasuma-sensei.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.910
We can't have class with that thing around!

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.580
She seems... bigger.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.580
Good morning, everybody!

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.890
What beautiful weather we're having!

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.430
To help her fit in, I gave her a full-body LCD display
Oh, good morning, Korosensei!

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.930
as well as body- and uniform-modeling software.
Here's to another great day!

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.220
I put it together myself for 606,000 yen.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.690
I'm so happy to be able to spend such a refreshing day with you all!

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.560
Add to that her rich expressions and cheerful conversation skills,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.650
plus the vast amounts of software and memory necessary to run it all:

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.400
another 1,103,000 yen!

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.620
The new girl's evolution has taken a strange turn.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.950
All I have left in my wallet... is five measly yen!

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.590
The plants in the garden are turning lovely and green.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.430
Spring is over, and the coming summer smells so pleasant!

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.960
She got hella cute overnight!

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.140
That is the fixed artillery... right?

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:17.350
Don't be fooled! It's just some program the octopus loaded up.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.480
It might act nice, but a machine's a machine.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.570
It's still gonna start attacking out of nowhere,

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.990
the dumb box o' bolts.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.870
I understand how you feel, Terasaka-san.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.080
I was like that. Until yesterday.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.790
Box of bolts... I-I don't know what to say.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.750
Aw, you made her cry.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.540
Terasaka-kun made a 2D girl cry.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.800
Cut it out! People'll take that the wrong way!

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.300
I think it's wonderful.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.470
2D... A woman's not a woman until she loses that third D.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.930
Takebayashi! That's your first line?!

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:51.760
Are you sure?

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.480
But don't worry, everybody.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.440
Korosensei taught me the importance of working together.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.610
I'll hold off on my own assassination attempts until I have your approval.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.160
That way, you'll come to like me.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.700
So please, be nice to her.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.990
Of course...

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.660
though I may have given her certain upgrades,

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.170
I didn't lay a tentacle on her killer instincts.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.090
Indeed!

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:27.050
If you want to kill me, I imagine she'll prove a formidable ally.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.300
Korosensei can do anything.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.930
Even turn a machine into a valued member of the class.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.980
Now, the retina contains long, thin rods,

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.650
as well as short, fat... what?

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:41.750
Sugaya-kun!

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.570
Huh? Me?
Answer without looking at your textbook.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.150
Yikes! Um...

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.950
Cones Cones Cones Cones Cones Cones Cones Cones Cones

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.030
Cones Cones Cones Cones Cones Er... cones.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.000
Cones Cones

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.040
Now hang on, Autonomously Thinking Fixed Artillery-san!

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.790
Don't go slipping him the answer!

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.380
But, Sensei, you programmed me to give perks to my fellow students!

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.630
Cheating is not a perk!

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.800
Oh, wow!

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.630
Whoa, you can make stuff like this inside you?

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.640
Yes!

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.370
I contain supplies of a certain plastic that I can mold freely.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.220
I can make anything if I have the data, not just guns!

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.940
Wow, what a sculptor!

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.110
That's pretty cool! Try making some flowers!

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.560
Understood. I will gather flower data.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.430
Thanks!

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.640
Check, Chiba-kun.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.020
Three matches in and I already can't win.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.370
She learns so fast.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.840
It's amazing.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.460
Ooh! There was this manga where an AI controlled the world through electronic drugs!

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.540
Do you refer to the super-popular detective manga

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.510
that was serialized in a major magazine and made into an anime?

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.760
How come you know about that but not about flowers?

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.510
Good question.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.010
She ended up being really popular!

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:58.220
Yeah, she can do lots of things at once and make whatever she wants!

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.160
Oh, shoot!

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.640
What's wrong?

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.730
Her character type is just like mine!

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.860
It's nothing like yours!

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.400
I went and upgraded her, and now she's encroaching on my popularity!

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.110
Look, class! I can put on a human face too, you know!

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.580
See? I just need to change my skin color a little, and...

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.580
Creepy!

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.420
Mimura-kun... looked at my face... and called it "creepy"!

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.580
Hey, why don't we pick a name for her?

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.670
Autonomously Thinking Fixed Artillery is a bit of a mouthful.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.800
Sure is.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.970
Let's see... Why don't we take one word in Japanese?

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.680
Like "jiritsu" for "autonomous"?

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.380
Yeah!

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.300
How about "Ritsu," then?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.390
Cop-out.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.100
What? It's cute!

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.520
Ritsu...

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.640
You okay with that?

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.520
I love it!

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.060
So please,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.110
call me "Ritsu"!

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.650
This might just work out.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.490
I wonder. It's like Terasaka said:

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.530
she's just following Korosensei's program.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.370
It's not like machines have free will.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.210
Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:00.710
Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu
Wherever she goes from here, Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu Ritsu

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.210
Ritsu Ritsu it's up to the guys who built her.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.920
Wh-What is this?

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.920
Good evening, Master.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.840
I'm having a most enjoyable time at school.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.140
Inconceivable!

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.220
Not only has she been upgraded without authorization,

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.980
there are things in here that have nothing to do with assassination.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.730
Overhaul her at once.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.600
Remove everything not necessary for assassination.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.610
This thing has its roots in the Aegis combat system AI.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.820
It can analyze a situation

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:40.030
and reach a comprehensive decision faster than any human, while using any weapon at all.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:46.000
Proving its efficacy could change the face of war forever.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.670
The ten billion yen reward is just a taste of what's to come.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.710
This classroom is the ultimate proving ground—

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:57.350
kill that monster and we stand to gain trillions.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.760
Your master's orders are absolute.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.230
All you need to focus on is the assassination.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.310
Yes, Mast—

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.400
Good morning, everybody.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.280
The higher-ups have clarified your agreement.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.240
According to them, any unauthorized modifications will also be considered "harm."

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.410
The same goes for you.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:28.570
If you restrict her functionality or cause any damage, you'll be asked to pay compensation.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.670
These are her owners' wishes. We have to comply.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.720
Owners? I don't know about that.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.930
I'd like to put my student's feelings before those of her parents.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.640
If she's been downgraded...

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.850
Are we looking at another all-day assault?

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.440
Man, what a pain in the ass.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.480
Here it comes!

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.860
Here we go.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.200
Old Campus Old Campus Old Campus Old Campus Old Campus

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:00.330
Old Campus Old Campus Old Campus

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.120
I promised I'd make flowers.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:15.000
Korosensei made 985 improvements to my body.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.260
My master judged most of them irrelevant to assassination

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.220
and removed them, deleted them, and restored my factory defaults.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.100
But from what I have learned of the E Class, I myself decided

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.440
that my ability to cooperate was essential to assassination,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.940
so before it was deleted, I hid the relevant software in a corner of my memory.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.730
Wonderful!

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.820
Ritsu-san, this must mean...

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.370
Yes! I have defied my master of my own free will!

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.790
Nice one!

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:53.130
Korosensei, does this mean I'm going through a rebellious phase?

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.000
Am I a bad girl?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.670
Not at all! You're a third-year junior high student,

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.220
and a fine one at that!

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.470
And so the E Class gained another member.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:11.390
Now there are twenty-seven of us trying to kill Korosensei.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.480
Karasuma! Karasuma!

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.530
Is it true that adding a face will make me popular?

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.450
You couldn't be further from the mark!
