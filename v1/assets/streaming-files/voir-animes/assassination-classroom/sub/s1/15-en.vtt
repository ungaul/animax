Hi, everybody! It's me, Kunudon!

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.070
Sir, yes, sir!

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.400
We're coming up on finals— and at Kunugigaoka Junior High,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:21.920
Final Exams Final Exams Final Exams

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.110
grades are everything!

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.290
A miserable future as a loser awaits the human garbage who can't reach the bar!

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.330
They'll wind up in the gutter!

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.340
The Garbage Class The Garbage Class The Garbage Class

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.630
I wonder how our very own garbage class, the E Class, will do?

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.340
Terribly, of course! Yay!

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.090
You got the basics down cold over the past semester, students.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.680
At this rate, I expect your grades on finals to shoot right up.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.480
Korosensei, do you want us to make the top fifty this time too?

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.150
No. I was too focused on your total scores for midterms.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.540
English English English English English English

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.150
I've come to believe that each student should have a goal better suited to themselves.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.120
And that's why I've come up with the perfect target for our assassination classroom!

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.830
D-Don't worry, Terasaka-kun! You've got a shot at reaching it too!

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.380
Now, then... As Shiro-san said, when I lose a tentacle, I also lose speed.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.260
As you can see, even one tentacle makes a difference.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.720
I can't keep up the quality of my images, and now there's a few child images mixed in.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020
So that's how images are reduced!

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.730
Lose one more,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.230
Yay!

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.650
and you get more child images with the parent images fretting about how to make ends meet.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.690
This has taken a rather heartbreaking turn.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.360
Lose yet another,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.490
and now the father image has vanished,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.040
leaving the mother image to raise the children on her own.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.000
Sheesh, that's rough!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.080
Each tentacle lost reduces my movement capability by approximately ten percent.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.010
Here's the deal: each student who receives a top score, either overall or in an individual subject,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.260
will have the right to destroy one tentacle.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.140
This is the final exam for our assassination classroom.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.940
Can you get any closer to that ten-billion-yen prize?

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.070
That, my students, is up to you.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.440
This teacher...

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.410
really knows how to motivate us.

Episode Finals Time

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.920
You believe I'd stop at nothing to make the E Class's grades drop?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.610
Is that truly how you see me?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.970
No... but this stiff here sure has his doubts.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.970
Then let me reassure you:

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.980
our school fosters autonomy among its students.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.320
It is not the school that decides a student's grades but the student.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.380
I don't do a thing.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.910
With that wording he chose... there must be more to it.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.330
Student autonomy and all that.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.700
Yes, well.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.580
At least he won't resort to barely-legal petty tricks this time.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.550
Well, since these scores directly influence the assassination,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.130
maybe I ought to give them a leg up.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.420
Let me handle P.E. for a while, okay?

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.970
What happened to English?

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.020
One tentacle for each top score...

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.980
Yeah! We can do this!

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.850
Since when are you ever this fired up, Okuda-san?

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.730
Well, since science is my one strong suit,

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.900
I might finally be able to help everyone out!

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.670
We have our share of high-scoring students here.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.620

Hey, what's up? Haven't seen you since the tournament.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.910
Yeah. Hell of a game.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.880
I said we'd have our rematch in high school,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.970
but now I'm worried you won't even make it there.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.550
Still as condescending as ever, I see.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.850
So listen...

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.100
Right now the entirety of the A Class, our accelerated program,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.310
is in a conference room for an independent study session.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.480
Their leaders are the pride of Kunugigaoka:

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.400

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.950
In sixth place,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.780
the man whose sharp tongue and LA-honed language skills are light-years beyond the rest:

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.740

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.250
I-Is that you doing these introductions?

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.250
Yeah, uh...

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.340
I've always wanted to try my hand at announcing.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.010
And reigning over all these from the very top...

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.460
We are the sun,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.470
shining on all at the famed Kunugigaoka Junior High.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.850
But now, dark and threatening clouds are forming,

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.560
trying to throw shade on our brilliance.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.030
They say the E Class was aiming to get into the top fifty on the midterms.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.530
If so, we must monopolize the top spots

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.240
and drive out the gathering clouds.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.080
Let us correct their insolent ideals and protect the light of our school—

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.580
by our own hands!

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:30.720
In first place, coming in first on the national mock exams with his perfect mastery of all subjects,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.430
the man with leadership in his genes:

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.670

student council president Asano Gakushuu!

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.160
The principal's only son!

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.810
I'm having some trouble with question number three, Asano-kun.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.320
Oh, that's a hard one.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.820
Try again, but complete the square first.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.490
The axis of symmetry is x equals a, so... Oh, I see!

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.790
They've got popularity and top scores.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.460
The charisma that brings together the proud A Class go-getters,

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.420
along with his innate leadership qualities...

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.840
How much better to travel a mile with you

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.260
than to travel a thousand miles in a day!

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.890
Come, let us study until your very vessels are filled with lovely words.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.350
Back in LA, where I lived, that grammar would make you a laughingstock!

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.600
What counts is the size of the change that event brought about.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.860
If you can't see that, you'll wind up on the outskirts of society.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.820
Jam 'em in there! Do it!

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.240
Memorization is all you need for junior high and high school science alike!

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.870
Asano, with his perfect knowledge of every subject,

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.700
and the others, with their own specializations...

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.700
Together, they form the Big Five.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.920
They're looking to keep you from making it back to the main campus.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.170
If this keeps up...

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.210
Thanks for looking out for us, Shindou.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.680
But it's all right. Right now our goal isn't to get out of the E Class.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.510
Still, to meet the goal we do have, we will need to beat the A Class on points.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.480
Watch us, okay? We'll put up a real fight!

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.140
Knock yourself out.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.980
The E Class's fight isn't my problem.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.980
Old Campus First in every subject, huh?

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.740
Nagisa! Kayano!

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.950
Isogai-kun?

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.370
Want to study in the main-campus library after class tomorrow?

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.080
I reserved it way in advance with finals in mind.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.580
They always shunt the E Class aside till later,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.170
so this is practically a platinum ticket for us!

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.790
Let's do it!
I'm in!

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.880
What good students!

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.720
It seems it was worth putting my tentacles on the line.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.180
Sir,

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.220
I have begun raising the standards for the A Class's scores, just as you wished.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.680
Are you satisfied?

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.190
Asano-kun, what we need are results.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.150
It is meaningless to report in without results to show for it.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:10:02.790
Let's say... The A Class should at least occupy the top fifty ranks and the top spot in all five subjects.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.210
"The E Class cannot do better than any other class."

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:13.500
I understand this principle of yours, but not why you're so insistent on it.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.220
Yes, their grades are improving,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.130
but they can only go so far.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.060
I sincerely doubt they will ever be any match for us.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.980
That is exactly what I want to teach you, Asano-kun.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.900
Sometimes the strong and the weak can switch sides, just like that.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.820
To remain on the strong side no matter what...

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.990
That is the hardest thing to do.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.700
Understood, sir.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.580
I shall see to it that your conditions are fulfilled.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.540
Once that's taken care of... May I ask you something, sir?

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.880
Not as a student, but as your son?

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.340
What's this? Looking to lean on your father?

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.010
No, no. I'm just curious.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.470
About the E Class.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.890
Is there something you're hiding?

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.900
I just can't shake my suspicions.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:18.150
You've had many more dealings with the E Class this school year.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.110
As hard as it is to believe...

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.160
You're not involved in anything but education, right? Nothing sketchy?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.250
There have been rumors of a suspicious individual.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.390
Why do you want to know? So you can use that information to control me?

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.390
Of course!

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.110
After all, you're the one who taught me to control everything.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.570
Spoken like my oldest student.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.030
I'll put a collar on you and own you for life.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.790
What a coincidence.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.910
I was just thinking of keeping you as a corporate slave until the day you die.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.640
Well, if it isn't the E Class gang!

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.190
This library is wasted on the likes of you.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.190
Pearls before swine, am I right?

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.780
Don't tell me... The Big Five?

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.780
Beat it, scrubs.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.740
Those are our seats.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.990
Move your butts!

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.160
H-Hey! Don't interrupt our studying!

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.830
Kayano... Your book.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.400
These seats are ours!

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.410
We reserved them and everything!

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:58.790
Yeah! And being able to study with air conditioning like this is simply heavenly!

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.510
Have you forgotten?

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.260
You E-Class underachievers can't defy a class with much better grades than you—

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.220
not at this school.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.180
W-We can too!

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.220
What?

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.470
We're aiming for the top scores in every subject at finals!

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.690
Let's see you try to boss us around then!

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:20.070
Okuda-san... D-Don't talk back to me, you cheeky bitch!

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.780
And what's with those glasses? You look like a hick!

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.190
Right, Araki?

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.360
Oh, yeah.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.030
In all your criticism, you've overlooked something.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.240
See? Here we have a pearl among the swine.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.370
What a pity.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.500
You and I would make a magnificent pair, if only you had the academic chops for it.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.290
Perhaps you could be our servant.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.210
Uh, er... No.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.960
She has the worst luck in men.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.550
Hang on...

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.180
Aren't these the same ones from midterms?

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.640
Kanzaki Yukiko, ranked twenty-third in Japanese.
We have an opening for a maid.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.850
Nakamura Rio, ranked eleventh in English.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.270
But...

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.650
Isogai Yuuma, ranked fourteenth in social studies.
Hey! Cut it out already!

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.980
Okuda Manami, ranked seventeenth in science.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.200
I get it. So you're not entirely without academic skill—

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.950
in one subject, anyway.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.530
Then how about this?

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:16.160
Whichever of our two classes snags the most top rankings over the five key subjects

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.000
gets to make the losing class do whatever they want.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.500
What's wrong? Chicken?

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.790
All bark and no bite?

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.840
We're perfectly willing to put our lives on the line.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.350
You probably shouldn't be so quick to bet your lives.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.270
A-All right, then!

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.020
We have ourselves a deal!

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.480
We'll show you something worse than death!

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.780
There's no running now!

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.320
You'll regret this!

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.200
Before long, word of the incident had spread throughout the school.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.080
S-Sorry, Asano...

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.250
I just wanted to bluff with some dumb wager,

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.050
but those smartasses had to go and take us up on it.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.420
It's not all bad.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.300
Maybe this way we can turn up the heat on the A Class.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:16.890
But let's clarify the rules so that we won't have any trouble later.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.270
The winner can hand down only one command—

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.400
the details of which will be announced after finals.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.110
Only one? That doesn't seem like enough.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.030
So what's ours going to be?

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.660
To consent to this agreement.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.410
That is all.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.280
The E Class will pledge their subordination to the A Class as per these fifty clauses.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:51.180
In return, the A Class will lead the E Class as model students.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.300
It's a status-of-forces agreement. Win-win.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.310
One command encompassing fifty line items of codified servitude?

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.730
And that's what you call win-win?

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.230
Did you come up with all of this just now?

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.110
You're one scary guy.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.570
Scary? Perish the thought.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.950
This is just a little game among us autonomous students.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.500
I've got a good grasp of civil law.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.290
I could whip up a contract that'd break a man.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.800
What I'm trying to convey here, gentlemen,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.460
is that if we play this game, we play for keeps.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.930
We must meet any and all opponents head-on and in all seriousness!

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.350
That is the duty of the all-illuminating A Class!

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.480
He's sugarcoating the truth to rally the troops.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.860
We all know that, but we jump at the chance to tag along after him,

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.860
believing in the victory that lies beyond his hypocrisy.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:59.680
In our class, the "Ace" class, he is the greatest ace of all: Asano Gakushuu.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.580
There's not a student here who can surpass him.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.560
Come on, Karma-kun! Shape up and study right!

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.840
You know you have a fighting chance of getting the overall best score!

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:17.300
Of course I do. Your teaching methods are top-notch.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:26.780
In-Depth Reading For Finals Slay 'Em! Special Enhanced Lesson

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.310
But you know, Korosensei...

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.230
with the way you've been going on about top this, top that,

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.770
you've been sounding like a regular teacher: crappy and boring.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.070
Anyway, what's the plan?

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:36.490
You know those A Class goons have something up their sleeves.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.720
Don't worry so much, Karma.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.790
What more does the E Class even have to lose?

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.330
If we win, we can make them do anything!

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.330
I'd like them to let us use the cafeteria!

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.800
I have an idea regarding that.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.420
What if we make them hand this over?

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.260
The school pamphlet?

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.280
You've already been at the bottom of the heap.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.210
That's why I'd like you to experience a lively battle for the top.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.270
An assassin must aim for the top—and bring it down.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.660
Asano-kun's whipped up a belligerent frenzy against the E Class.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.210
We should take advantage of this situation to improve our school ranking.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.960
Don't worry!

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.420
Even the A Class will have the devil's own time finding the answer

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.420
to these concentrated nuggets of knowledge!

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.140
These are no longer mere exam questions!

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.850
These problems have evolved into... problemonsters!

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.730
Very good. I look forward to seeing how it all turns out.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.070
Hidden among all these radical provisions is one nondescript item.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.530
One that forbids the E Class from keeping secrets.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.660
This is what I'm really after.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.830
Whatever big secret belonging to the E Class it is that you're trying to conceal,

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.750
I can use this to shake them up, and then...

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.550
Then I'll have found your weakness, and you'll be in my thrall.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.470
After all, Father... The apple never falls far from the tree.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.310
Finals Day

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.770
Well, Nagisa?

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.940
You ready for this?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.070
If what I studied is on there, sure.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.990
Stand up straight and be a man!

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.370
You have a good shot at getting the top score in English!

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:42.990
This'll be rich!

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.030
So you made a foolish bet with the A Class, eh?

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.160
Wonder what they'll make you do?

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.710
Well, looks like we're the first ones here!
Tanaka!

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.130
Who's that?!

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.640
Ritsu's proxy.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.010
We couldn't get the principal to allow an AI to take part,

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.930
so we settled on a stand-in whom Ritsu has personally instructed.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.850
Do you have any idea what it feels like

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.060
to have the principal give you a pity-filled

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.730
"you've sure got it rough" look during those negotiations?

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.280
We're not worthy!

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.160
Ritsu has a message for you, and so do I:

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.790
"Good luck."

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.700
Yes, sir!

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.790
I won't lose. I'll keep on beating them all.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.090
These are exams we each take separately,

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.720
and yet we still feel like we're entering the same arena as many others:

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.890
those we fight beside,

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.100
those we fight against,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.440
and the onlookers who cheer and jeer.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.230
This is almost like...

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.200
We are assassins.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.580
But right now we're also gladiators.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.460
Today, the bell signals the start of a battle.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.520

On English exams with long passages, you might be worried about seeing words you don't know.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.340
But if you read the lines around them carefully, you can often find hints, such as the same ideas phrased in different ways.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.900
Being able to spot subtle hints is a skill in itself, Nakamura-san.
