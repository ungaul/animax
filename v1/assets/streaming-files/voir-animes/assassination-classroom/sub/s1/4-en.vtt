Long time no see, Big Teach.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.690
Yes. Payday's come at last.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.860
Japan's cheap snacks are of superb quality.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.020
More than worth the effort of disguising myself, I'd say.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.490
Stop that!

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.660
Aw, just come with us, will ya?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.120
But I have to get to my new teaching job!

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.290
So you're a teacher!

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.960
Hey, we could use a little tutoring ourselves!

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.050
How about a crash course in picking up women from your car?

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.350
Lesson 1: it is vital to decorate your car beautifully.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.930
Wriggly wrapping!

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.890
The car's covered in ribbons!

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.270
There is no Lesson 2.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.310
Are you all right?

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.270
Thank you so much!

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.400
I thought chivalry was dead.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.730
I'll never forget your kindness!

Episode Grown-Up Time Old Campus

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.050
Now, allow me to introduce your new English teacher.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.510
My name's Irina Jelavich. It's wonderful to meet you all!

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.470
What a knock-out!

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.390
What knockers!

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.930
Wait... Why's she all over him?

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.600
Who'd have thought you'd be a teacher here?

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.440
I hate her already.
I'm wearing a wig.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.440
Oh, I don't mind!

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.980
One of our school goals is to give you authentic experience in foreign languages.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.900
I trust there'll be no objections to her taking over half your English lessons?

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.030
Well, if you insist.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.530
We've got us one heck of a teacher!

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.040
What's more, she seems to really have a thing for Korosensei.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.200
Uh-huh.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.960
I might get some new hints for the assassination out of this.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.420
I guess Korosensei wouldn't know what to do with a human woman hanging all over him.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.970
His face has so many unique colors...

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.970
so what color is "bewilderment"?

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.270
He's just plain smitten!

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.350
There's no mistaking that face.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.860
I guess he's fine with a human, too.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.070
Korosensei's Weak Point #5:
Boobs

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.150
The more I look at you, the more I like what I see.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.240
Your beady eyes, like two diarrhea pills...

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.950
Your strange, floppy limbs...

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.490
Why, you're positively captivating!

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.490
How embarrassing!

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.280
Don't fall for it, Korosensei!

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.710
No woman finds those things attractive!

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.920
We're not that dense.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.800
Any teacher who would join us under these circumstances

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.840
probably has more to them than meets the eye.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.760
Hup! Pass! Hup! Kill!

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.430
I had all kinds of ways to approach him prepared.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.230
I just never thought seduction would work.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.110
Irina Jelavich, professional assassin.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.700
With her drop-dead gorgeous looks and fluency in ten languages,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.700
she can bewitch targets from anywhere in the world

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.620
and eliminate even the most heavily guarded marks from point-blank range with ease.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.360
Her finesse at infiltration and approach has raised her assassinations to an art form.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.800
However, we can't just hire an assassin to work at a school.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.390
You'll also need to do some teaching for the sake of appearances.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.970
I'm a pro.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.810
I'll have the job done before it comes to that.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.690
Hup! Pass!

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.030
Hup! Kill!

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.120
Hup! Pass!

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.740
Hup! Kill!

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.490
Hup! Pa—

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.200
Korosensei!

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.660
Oh, Korosensei!

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.920
Karasuma-sensei tells me you're oh-so-very fast! Is that true?

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.380
Well, I wouldn't say I'm that fast.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.380
Through Korosensei's Eyes Through Korosensei's Eyes
Through Korosensei's Eyes Could you do me a favor?

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.050
Through Korosensei's Eyes Through Korosensei's Eyes
Through Korosensei's Eyes

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.880
I'd love to try some real Vietnamese coffee.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.720
Through Korosensei's Eyes Through Korosensei's Eyes
Through Korosensei's Eyes

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.390
Through Korosensei's Eyes Through Korosensei's Eyes
Through Korosensei's Eyes

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.590
Do you think you could bring me some during English class?

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.060
Through Korosensei's Eyes Through Korosensei's Eyes
Through Korosensei's Eyes

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.590
Through Korosensei's Eyes Through Korosensei's Eyes
Through Korosensei's Eyes

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.140
Why, of course.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.430
I happen to know a great café in Vietnam.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.570
So, er... Irina-sensei?

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.110
Class is starting. Shouldn't we go back in?

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.360
Class? Oh, right.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.830
Just make it study hall or something.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.460
Also, could you not call me by my first name?

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.840
I won't be playing teacher unless that octopus is around,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.720
so you will refer to me as Miss Jelavich.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.140
So what are you going to do, Miss Bitch?

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.940
1) A woman with an unpleasant personality.
2) A sexually promiscuous woman.
3) A female dog.
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150
It's "vich"!

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.560
You're an assassin, right?

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.480
The entire class together couldn't take down this monster,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.520
but you're going to kill him all by yourself?

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.630
Still a child, I see. Grown-ups have their own grown-up ways of doing things.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.610
You must be Shiota Nagisa.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.460
Come to the staff room later.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.210
I'd like to see what you have on him.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.800
The same goes for anyone else with key intel!

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.340
I'll give you something good in return.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.010
If you girls prefer, you can have one of my men instead.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.390
It's a pro's job to have both technique and connections.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.350
You brats go watch from the outfield.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.690
Oh, and one more thing.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.030
If you interfere even slightly with my assassination,

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.900
I won't hesitate to kill you.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.570
Kisses powerful enough to make you swoon.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.370
Tough-looking companions.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.620
And a threat delivered with unfaltering determination.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.080
We knew at once that she was the real deal: a professional killer.
Sorry for that awful farce this morning.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.550
But at the same time, most of the class knew something else:

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.520
that they hated her.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.140
Study Hall Study Hall Study Hall Study Hall Study Hall

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.310
Study Hall Study Hall Study Hall Study Hall

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.970
I've never killed an unidentified life-form like this before.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.100
Everything's ready.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.730
The boy's shared his intel with me.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.660
We've managed to destroy single tentacles before, but that doesn't faze him.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.620
It's possible that you might have to destroy all his tentacles at once.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.400
He can easily escape before you finish him off.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.080
And...

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.540
If you're planning to sneak up on him, you probably shouldn't smoke.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.210
Hello there. Oh, those chocolate bamboo-shoot cookies!
Korosensei has a keen sense of smell for someone with no nose.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.470
That won't conflict with my plan.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.260
I am Irina Jelavich, a pro among pros

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.600
who's pulled off assassinations in all kinds of circumstances.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.730
C'mon, Miss Bitch, are you teaching us or what?

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.730
Yeah, Miss Bitch!

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.480
I mean, you are a teacher here, right, Miss Bitch?

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.690
Quit your "bitch"ing!

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.030
For one thing, they're pronounced differently!

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:36.870
m 615 708 l 615 900 634.5 900 634.5 795 645 786 655.5 778.5 667.5 772.5 678 771 690 772.5 696 775.5 702 783 705 795 705 900 726 900 726 787.5 720 775.5 712.5 765 705 759 693 756 679.5 756 669 757.5 661.5 760.5 648 768 636 777 634.5 777 634.5 708
Slavic name suffix meaning "child of"

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.870
You Japanese just can't differentiate between "B" and "V"!
A woman with an unpleasant personality.
A sexually promiscuous woman.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.870
A female dog.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.700
I'll teach you the correct way to pronounce "V."

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.120
First, lightly bite your bottom lip. Go on!

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.460
Yes, that's right.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.340
Now stay like that for an hour and give me some peace and quiet.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.670
What kind of lesson is this?!

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.510
Old Campus

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.510
I understand you've brought in a rather shady trio.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.050
I wasn't informed of this.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.930
Yes: all pros, all more than competent, not to mention tight-lipped.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.850
They're so in love with me they'll do whatever I ask. For free.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.020
Everything's set up. Today I act.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.780
Irina-sensei!

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.700
Here's the Indian chai you requested.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.200
Oh, thank you, Korosensei!

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.580
Just what I wanted for my afternoon tea!

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.700
Oh, and Korosensei, I'd like to speak with you.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.920
Could you come to the equipment shed during fifth period?

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.250
Speak with me?

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.880
But of course.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.750
Fifth period, right?

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.670
I'll be there with certain-tea!

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.340
You know, since chai's a tea? Get it?

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.350
Hey, now. You kiddin' me?

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.680
They're headin' for the shed together?!

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.560
Kind of a let-down,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.810
My trip to India was perfect chai-ming, don't you think?
watching Korosensei fall for such an obvious ploy.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.110
Karasuma-sensei?

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.610
I don't think we'll ever warm up to her.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.240
Sorry about that. She was hired on government orders.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.910
Still...

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.160
Being able to complete all her preparations in a single day

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.130
proves she's an assassin of the highest caliber.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.550
So what did you want to talk about, Irina-sensei?

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.510
Assassination by infiltration requires flexibility toward one's target.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.570
I'm up against an unidentified life-form.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.680
Best to do it quickly, before he gets suspicious.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.680
Korosensei...

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.770
I... I always fall head over heels for exceptional people.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.270
With your body, your strength...

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.940
It was love at first sight.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.950
Oh, er, uh—

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.200
Do you think that's strange of me?

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.200
I need to be as forceful as necessary to distract him

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.120
so that he won't notice what's really going on.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.500
I spent all night fixing up the place.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.840
All to hunt you down, target of mine.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.600
You're a bad boy, Korosensei.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.310
We can't do this! Not here!

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.180
You foolish, foolish man.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.190
Farewell.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.400
Give me a minute to take all this off.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400
All?!

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.030
Relax. It'll be all over before you know it.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.910
All...

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.290
Live ammo and real guns.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.330
An M61,

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.420
an M134, and an M249.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.630
All spraying ammo with superlative speed and firepower.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.300
Those weird pellets won't be necessary.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.540
After all, there's nothing this barrage of bullets couldn't kill.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:50.060
Firing sequence complete in three, two, one,

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.230
ze—

00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.490
I regret to inform you that lead bullets are useless against me, Irina-sensei.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.110
They simply melt inside my body.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.450
Now, take a good look at my face.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.160
You have... four eyes?!

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.170
No, two of them are nostrils.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.380
They look the same!

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.800
I detected a metallic odor and an old-man smell that wasn't present in this shed until yesterday.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.680
They were so out of place as to open my nostrils.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.890
Korosensei has a keen sense of smell for someone with no nose.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.400
By pretending to be caught in your trap, I could easily uncover my assassin.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.110
In other words...

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.960
as a pro, you clung too tightly to conventional assassination methods.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.780
My students' attempts are far more flexible and formidable.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.240
And did you know?

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.460
My retaliation takes the form of care and grooming.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.630
No!
slither slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither slither

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.170
slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither slither slither

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:55.920
slither slither

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.500
What was that?

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.000
Gunshots, a scream... and now slithery sounds?

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.170
slither slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.750
slither slither slither slither

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.050
slither slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither slither

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.260
slither No!

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.760
slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither slither
slither slither slither slither

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.510
slither slither slither slither slither slither
slither slither No... slither slither slither slither

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.510
slither slither

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.810
He's slithering her silly!

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:11.930
Let's go!

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.100
Korosensei!

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.230
How are the boobs?!

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.160
I would've liked to enjoy myself a little longer,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.940
but thoughts of our classes together drew me away.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.030
Wh-What happened in there?

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.540
Miss Bitch is wearing a wholesome, retro P.E. outfit!

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.170
To think he did all that to me in just one minute...

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.630
He loosened my stiff shoulders and back,

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.210
gave me a lymphatic beauty massage,

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.260
changed my clothes at top speed,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.720
and did that slithery thing with his tentacles.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.560
What thing?!

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.020
What did you do, Korosensei?

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.980
Oh, you know, grown-ups need grown-up care.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.610
That is not the face of innocence!

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.350
Now, back to the classroom, students!

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.610
Yes, sir!

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.570
This is unforgivable. I've never suffered such an unsightly failure!

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.540
I vow on my professional reputation to repay him for this disgrace!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.960
Study Hall

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.970
I'll show that octopus that a pro doesn't give up so easily!

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.130
I'll need all-new supplies.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.720
Dammit! Why doesn't this podunk school have Wi-Fi?!

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.810
You're trying awfully hard, Miss Bitch.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.930
Guess he really did a number on your pride, huh?

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.450
Sensei?

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.230
What?

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.780
If you're not going to teach us anything, could you bring back Korosensei?

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.830
We've got entrance exams this year.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.320
Ha! You want that vicious creature to teach you?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.080
You think your exams matter when the whole planet's at stake?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.410
Must be nice being a clueless brat!

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.960
Not to mention, I understand you Class E students are the dregs of this school.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.880
Why even bother studying at this point?

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.960
I know. How about this?

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.850
If I successfully assassinate him, I'll give you five million yen each!

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.100
That's far more than you'd stand to gain from a bunch of useless schoolwork!

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.810
So shut your dumb mouths and do as I—

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:23.850
Get out.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.240
Take a hike, you stupid bitch!

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.610
Bring back Korosensei!

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.580
Where'd all this come from? I'll kill you all!

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.670
Boobs Go Home!!

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.740
I'd like to see you try!

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.750
Yeah, that's right! Down with big boobs!

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.660
That's your problem?

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.840
What is with those brats?!

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.280
How are they not grateful just to be breathing the same air as a woman like me?!

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.010
I don't think they see it the same way you do. Hence the class riot.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.220
You should apologize to them.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.810
If you want to stick around long enough to try again, that is.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:03.690
Why should I? Do I look like a teacher to you?

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.900
Let me focus on the assassination!

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.960
All right. Come with me.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.120
Erromango, one of the islands of Vanuatu, or the New Hebrides...

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.490
What's he playing at?

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.660
He's writing test questions.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.920
That's what he does every Wednesday during sixth period.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.460
He's sure taking his sweet time.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.920
At Mach 20, he should've finished ages ago.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.300
He writes different questions for each student.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:41.420
They take into account the students' strong and weak subjects.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.580
Chiba has spatial figures down pat.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.860
Why don't I throw in a trick question to mix things up?

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.950
He's a creature of superhuman intelligence and speed who's out to destroy the earth...

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.360
and yet his teaching work is close to perfect.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.950
Take this!

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.130
Now look at the students.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.460
They're just fooling around.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.920
That activity trains their ability to strike a moving target with a knife.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.970
It's called assassination badminton. I taught it to them.
Attack!

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:13.970
That's a thrust! 3 points!
Huh?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.600
Target and teacher, assassins and students...

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.590
Here, in this bizarre classroom that came about because of that creature,

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:25.210
everyone has two roles to play.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.060
You make a big deal out of being a professional,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.200
but if you can't be both an assassin and a teacher,

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.030
that makes you the most inept professional here.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.690
You okay?
Sheesh!

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.830
If you want to stay here and continue going after him,

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.920
don't look down on these students.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.520
"You are incredible in bed." Repeat.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.510
Come on!

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.570
"Y-You are incredible in bed."

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.280
When I assassinated a certain VIP in America,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.600
the first thing I did was seduce his bodyguard.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.360
Those are the words he said to me. They mean:

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.250
"You screw like nobody's business!"

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.090
Just what are you making us junior high kids say?!

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.280
It's often said that the fastest way to learn another language

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.180
is to get yourself a lover who speaks it.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.880
You want to know what they're feeling,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.890
so you try your hardest to understand what they say.

Therefore, my lessons will teach you how to sweet-talk foreigners.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.950
The basics of endearing conversation, straight from a pro assassin:

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.460
master them and they'll come in handy with a real, live foreigner.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.670
A foreigner!

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.250
Let that octopus teach you what you need to know for your exams.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:19.630
The only thing I can teach you is practical conversation skills.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.620
And if you still don't think of me as a teacher,

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.640
I'll give up on my assassination and leave.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.980
Y-You're okay with that, right?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.480
And... I'm sorry about everything else.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:45.950
Why so nervous? You were threatening to kill us a moment ago!

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.070
She's totally a teacher now.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.290
We can't call you "Miss Bitch" anymore.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.760
You... You understand!

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.760
It was a pretty rude thing to call a teacher.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.440
Yeah. We need something else.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.800
How about Bitch-sensei?

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.430
Er... How about we move away from the whole "bitch" thing?

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.790
Just call me by my first name. I don't mi—

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.290
That "bitch" thing really caught on, though.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:22.030
Yeah. "Bitch-sensei" fits her way better than "Irina-sensei."

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.470
Well, there you have it. Welcome, Bitch-sensei!

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.990
Let's get started, Bitch-sensei!

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.710
I hate you all so much!

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.080
She's fitting right in.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.920
More or less.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.880
You think you can mess with me? You damn brats!

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.840
Thank you, Karasuma-sensei.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.930
I want my students to be able to converse with an actual foreigner,

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:56.770
and really, who better than a globe-trotting assassin?

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.730
Did he seriously see all this coming?

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.950
Time to top off my sugar reserves after all that hard mental work!

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.740
He stubbornly refuses to say why he chose to teach E Class.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.950
But the more we make it the perfect place for an assassination,

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.340
I'll give you "Bitch-sensei"! Do it right!

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.580
the more we end up making it the perfect place to learn.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.560
Aren't you cute?

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.290
I am not!

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.960
This monster's got us all wrapped around his little tentacle.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.130
There'll be a big taste test tonight!

The word "bitch" originally refers to a female dog,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.060
but now it's also used to describe unpleasant, mean-spirited women.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.850
Good question. People typically use the word "beautiful"

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.980
to describe good-looking women, Nagisa.
