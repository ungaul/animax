00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.620
Class...

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.510
There's something I forgot to mention in my earlier lesson.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.950
Even an assassin who's cleverly avoided all head-to-head battles

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.240
is sure to have at least one encounter in their life

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.160
where they must fight with every last ounce of strength they possess.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.370
And in my case...

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.140
that would be now!

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.390
Korosensei!

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.910

It's like someone's snatching away my security blanket

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.720

23rd Period Chiba Ryuunosuke &amp; Hayami Rinka
Final Boss Time

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.670
A sonic boom with every attack...

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.180
That was what we could expect from the extraordinary battle that was underway.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.360
Though we couldn't make out their movements, we knew this much:

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.180
Korosensei was overwhelmingly losing ground!

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.600
Korosensei!

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.200
Feeling hopeless yet, guinea pig?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.080
Two against one, times tentacles...

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.160
times genius... times the power of hate.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.080
We've far surpassed the likes of you!

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.140
Please...

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.510
Teach me to kill!

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.360
Are you certain? That was your father I just killed, you know.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.820
That doesn't matter!

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.900
When I saw you, my father's killer, it finally came to me:

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.360
This is what my life of luxury has been missing!

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.130
I want to learn your skills! Even if I die trying!

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.570
The boy didn't know right from wrong,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.830
but his eyes were brimming with talent

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.620
and his own brand of hopes and dreams.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.300
It didn't have to have come to this.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.160
Before he threw away his future and his sanity,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.450
there must have been another way to have raised him.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.440
Their battle was in a whole different dimension.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.320
One beyond our imagination.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.120
Enough to make us feel as though all our hard work over the past year had been meaningless.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.170
We were a hindrance.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.350
We couldn't do anything—not even run away.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.900
We were Korosensei's greatest...

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.610
Is he... starting to dodge?!

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.070
Hmph. Then how about this?

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.410
Not even close!

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.910
Wow...

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.540
Deflecting attacks with the very minimum amount of energy,

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.800
using dirt to block the blinding light,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.680
and closing in so the enemy can't build momentum...

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.510
He's closing their battle-power gap through ingenious moves!

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.970
That's our Korosensei, through and through.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.940
Chalk this part up to sheer experience!

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.650
This is where I, the teacher, take responsibility

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.580
for a pupil of mine who's strayed from the path.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.420
However...

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.760
Yanagisawa. Leave us.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.160
This is a place for students to learn and grow.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.670
You have no right to be here!

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.980
Still fancy yourself a teacher, eh, guinea pig?

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.060
Then let's put you to the test.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.920
Don't you see why we chose this moment to make our move?

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.560
You'll protect them, right?

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.270
Isn't that what a teacher does?

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.880
What is this?

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.080
Where are the kids?

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.420
Korosensei!

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.930
Korosensei!

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.560
You're the very model of an educator, guinea pig!

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.040
Were you on your own, you could avoid these harsh blows,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.580
but you take them head-on to protect your students!

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.530
All right, 2.0: next!

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.160
Next.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.320
Next!

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.580
Next! Next! Next!

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.790
Such darkly seething emotions...

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.430
The strongest feeling in the world is the bloodlust born of love.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.800
He surely won't be satisfied until his target is torn to pieces,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.380
body and soul...

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.360
Korosensei!

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.500
Put the target with his students and this was a foregone conclusion.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.570
You chose wrong, kids.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.160
Deciding to show up here tonight was a bad move.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.170
Stop, Yanagisawa!

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.630
Don't drag those students in any deeper!

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.670
Karasuma!

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.470
Shut up and watch, government lapdogs.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.680
You don't stand a chance against me now, let alone both of us.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.900
We'd seen it all along.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.860
We'd seen it, and yet...

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.340
we'd looked away.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.740
I estimate seven or eight of them will die.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.840
You'll have to jump in and save them, Korosensei.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.790
How does it feel?

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:49.500
What's it like, seeing your students despair that they're holding back their dear, dear teacher?

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.520
Now do you see it? Your biggest weak point?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.980
Korosensei's biggest weak point...

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.980
was us.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:03.980


00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.270
Us That's preposterous!

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.210
This isn't a question of choosing right or wrong!

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.600
They risked life and limb to try to save me

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.940
and overcame obstacles to meet me here!

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.370
That whole journey, that dedication—

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.540
they're the greatest gift a teacher could receive!

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.420
They're not a weak point, and they're not a hindrance!

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.700
They're my students!

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.910
And I'm proud of each and every one of them!

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.440
What's more,

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.470
protecting one's students is a teacher's natural duty!

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:53.120
Yes, yes, very good. But we'll deny you that duty of yours, too.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.760
Soon your strength will run out,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.910
and the students you've been protecting?

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.370
I will slaughter them.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:07.630
This year you gained by destroying our lives...

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.640
I'll make it all have been for naught!

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.140
Then our revenge will finally be complete!

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.320
Now, let's continue.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.620
Better protect those sweet students of yours.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:22.970
Huh?!

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.060
You fool!

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.140
What is she doing?!

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.260
Run, Korosensei.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.230
I'll buy you time! Just hide somewhere and recover!

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.690
Kayano-san?!

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.490
Oh?

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.250
That's a former tentacle-user for you.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.710
You've retained that kinetic vision, I see.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.880
Stop, Kayano-san!

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.640
I'd regretted it all this time.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.710
That it was my fault the class learned the truth.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.850
That I'd snatched away the fun times we'd had together.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.590
So please, at least let me protect you...

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.190
as your student!

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.240
You were right!

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.720
Thanks to your actions,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.650
the class got to learn what was truly important!

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:21.590
2.0!

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.340
Don't worry, Korosensei.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.200
You can do it if you try.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.860
You know who taught me that? My sister...

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.220
and you yourself!

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.970
I-I get to have both sisters die right in front of me?!

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.770
What a couple of troublemakers!

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.250
Maybe I should've kept her as her sister's stand-in!

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:40.440
Though I prefer my girls not to be riddled with holes, you know?

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.920

Assassination Classroom Final Season Kayano Kaede

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.090
There we go!

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.800
When you're beside yourself, emotions running wild, your whole body goes pitch-black!

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.540
And only then can you unleash your full power!

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.100
In other words, this is the destructive creature showing his true colors!

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.110
You yourself have undone the whole year you spent

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.150
wearing that ridiculous yellow hypocrite's face!

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.860
Most satisfactory!

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.260
And as for this full-bore fury of yours...

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.340
2.0's true power will render that meaningless as well.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.800
Now for his final attack.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.980
Let's get away from here!

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:01.150
Nagisa?

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.120
Now, while his attention is elsewhere!

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.530
If we stay, we'll get caught up in this for sure!

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:11.690
B-But... Discretion is the better part of valor!

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.970
This was one hellish year, all right.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.060
But it ends now.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.430
What?! A white light?

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.700
But his tentacles are still black.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.210
No...

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.440
It's yellow.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.790
Nope, red!

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.470
Green!

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.050
Blue!

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.520
White!

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.370
All my colors...

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.220
All my emotions...

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.970
All my past...

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.680
All my life,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.030
all mixed together...

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.850
into pure-white energy.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.150
My pupil...

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.860
May your graduation, at least, be peaceful.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:44.210
Sh-Shit! If that thing liquefies the tentacle cells in me right now...

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.830
Nooo!

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.310
What's with the flowers?

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.840
I just picked a few for decoration.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.520
Thought it might be handy to develop a skill that eases the atmosphere a bit.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.230
I can get rid of them if they're in the way.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.620
No, leave them. You've got good taste.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.160
Better than mine.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:26.500
Oh, good! Then I'll bring in new ones every day!

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.460
You could...

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.810
but you ought to be studying chemistry daily instead.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.820
You couldn't kill a mosquito with what you know now.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.090
If only I had seen that smile,

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.820
I might have been able to guide him down an entirely different path in life.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.490
The tentacles asked me what I wanted to be.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.600
I wanted you to acknowledge me.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.700
I wanted... to be like you.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.420
Now I can understand how you feel.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.500
If we meet on the other side... let's study together.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.930
So we won't make the same mistakes.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.660
No one shouted for joy.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.390
Korosensei?

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.280
Kayano... She's...

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.400
Kaede-chan...

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.550
Let's lay her down.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.820
No, don't, Nagisa-kun.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.540
I don't want her to have too much contact with germs in the soil.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.000
Korosensei...

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.560
Class, the past you've lost will never come back.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.720
I myself have made countless mistakes.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:42.120
But we can learn from the past so we don't repeat it.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.520
Huh? Wh-What's this?

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.440
Kayano-san's blood and somatic cells.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.720
I gathered them up before they fell to the ground

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.570
and stored them in a sterile membrane I made with compressed air.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.600
I-In the middle of the battle?!

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.830
I'd already set aside several tentacles for protecting you all.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.740
Now to string all these cells together, one by one.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.000
More quickly,

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.520
more accurately...

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.920
I honed my skills all year long—

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:26.970
so that if history did repeat itself, it wouldn't have the same tragic ending.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:32.150
Some cells can't be repaired, so instead I'll leave gaps

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.240
and fill them with my mucus.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:41.410
Within a few days, her own cells should regenerate and replace it.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.720
I'm a tad low on blood. Type AB donors, please!

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.840
Nakamura-san! Gather up that birthday cake and put it in my mouth!

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.880
What?!

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.840
But it's a smashed-up pile of dirt-covered garbage!

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.380
I need to replenish my energy!

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.030
And I wanted to eat it that whole fight! I invoke the thirty-minute rule!

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.260
It's the three-second rule!

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.850
Yum, yum, yum!

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.570
The wound's closing up—

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.570
without a single stitch, without leaving a single mark.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.520
Now, once her heart starts working, she'll come back to life.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.910
It should go perfectly, according to my "Emergency Response Guide for a Gut-Shot Student at School."

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.540
Who the heck'd anticipate something like that?!

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:40.820
I couldn't tell you earlier, but I was even prepared to put your bodies back together if they were torn to pieces.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.830
As long as I was around, anyway.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.480
As long as the teacher... actually sees his student.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.540
Did you save me... again?

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.940
I'll save you as many times as it takes.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.170
Your sister would have done no less.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.720
The important thing is not repeating your mistakes.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:37.500
komorebi ga yasashiku sashikomu ookina mado no naka
As the dappled sunlight shone gently through the window

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.400
Aguri? Did I do a good job as a teacher...

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:47.760
kimi to deatta ano hi wo tooku ni kanjita
The day I met you felt so far away

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:43.100
during this treasure of a year that you gave me?

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:59.000
sukoshi zutsu narabeta omoide wa boku wo atatameru
The memories I've arranged little by little keep me warm

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:12.020
chiisana heya tsunagu kokoro sotto oshiete kureta
A small room, hearts connecting: you taught me gently

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:24.810
kono kisetsu ga mukae ni kitara kimi no sugata mou sagasu koto mo
Once this season comes for me, I won't be able

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:30.050
dekinaku nacchaun da ne dekinaku nacchaun da ne
To seek you out anymore, will I?

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:35.690
zutto wasurezu ni iru yo zutto wasurezu ni iru yo
But I'll hold your memory in my heart

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:41.670
mata kimi ni aeru hi made mata kimi ni aeru hi made
Until the day I can see you again
