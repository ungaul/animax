00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.900
Merry Christmas!

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.190
What a marvelous Christmas Eve!

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.900
Yes, February means Christmas, all right!

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.740
Happy New Year!

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.200
Yes, a new year is upon us!

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.030
Tackle your studies and your assassination alike with renewed enthusiasm!

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.870
Best Wishes for the New Year Best Wishes

Now, then... Best Wishes for the New Year Best Wishes
for the New Year

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.580
Time to laze the day away.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.590
Where's he going with all this?

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.660
So you're trying to take all the fun year-end events you missed out on and cram them into February?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.680
Ah! Exactly right!

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.350
Our one and only winter break together, and not a single one of you came to visit!

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.620
And you were so earnestly worried and trying so hard on my behalf

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.690
that it didn't feel right for me to invite you over.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.980
It was a dumb thing to fret about when we were all so bummed out.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.110
Well, with all that behind you, now's the perfect time!

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.410
We'll take back the winter break we lost—all at once!

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.660
Korosensei's living life as frantically as ever.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.140
But it's already February. The time when everyone has to think about their future.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.750
We each have to figure out where we're going before we say goodbye.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.970
With just thirty-two days left before graduation day—

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.270
and the deadline for assassinating Korosensei.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:02:48.980


00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.880

It's like someone's snatching away my security blanket

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.710

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.860
Future plans, eh?

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.780
What high schools are you guys going to?

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.550
Some place a little less competitive to give us breathing room.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.540
Korosensei taught us the fundamentals through senior year—

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.750
high school can be all about honing our techniques.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.010
Must be nice. We're really pushing ourselves.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.460
"If you're going into media, you need a solid academic record!"

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.840
Or so I've been told.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.340
You sound nothing like him!

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.750
Where are you headed, Karma?

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.090
Ah, I'll stay at Kunugigaoka.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.890
Huh?

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.200
You mean you'll take the entrance exam all over again?

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.270
I figured you'd try for something better.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.770
I mean, you could get into the best high schools around.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.090
Put yourself in the main-campus students' shoes.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.460
How'll they feel when the guy they thought they'd chased away is back—

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.450
and standing head and shoulders above them?

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.200
I can't wait to spend three whole years rubbing it in their small-time faces.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.100
You're as charming as always, I see.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.710
Besides,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.400
there are better schools in terms of average academic ability,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.850
but only Kunugigaoka has students who'd be fun to take on

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.930
in one-on-one academic showdowns.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.600
I'll have no problem getting the job I'm after,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.810
so I figure I've got time to slow down and enjoy a battle or three.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.910
That's so you, Karma.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.060
You've got your dream school, right, Nagisa?

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.830
Uh-huh.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.020
Not to mention Kayano, Sugino,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.310
and everyone else...

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.770
It's almost time to say goodbye.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.830
We're each going our own way.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.230
My top pick is Keisetsu University's prep school.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.500
It's crazy tough, but it's the best shortcut for getting into the college Mom wanted to send me to.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.700
After college, though...

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.280
With these odd, anachronistic talents of mine,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.100
I'm not sure what I can be, or even what I want to be.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.340
But everyone else is figuring it out.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.520
Nagisa? Nagisa!

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.970
I said, I finished the workbook!

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.040
Sorry, Sakura-chan.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.240
What're you zoning out for?

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.180
There you were, vowing that you'd teach me everything I needed

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.920
to march right back into school this term, and now what?

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.840
It wasn't a vow, exactly.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.370
More like a hopeful goal.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.360
Hmm. So you're pondering your future?

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.400
Junior-high kids have it rough.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.750
I don't even know what I want to be.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.720
What is there?

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.480
I mean, apart from being a teacher?

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.190
Ever since I met you, that's what you've been to me.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.440
A... teacher?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.830
And if you don't wanna be a teacher, I could let you be my boyfriend!

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:50.320
It took her saying it for me to realize: people look up to those who change them.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.040
Like a child whose life is saved by a doctor wanting to follow in his footsteps...

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.430
Like a boy bewitched by beautiful skills longing to be an assassin...

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.410
I looked up to that teacher of ours.

A student's family?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:29.110
Go, go, Nagisa! Yay!

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.750
Wh-What's with this indistinct mob of giants?!

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.220
They're overshadowing our cram school's famous joint send-off!

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.460
Wh-What the heck are you doing, Korosensei?!

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.000
Cheering you on, of course!

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.190
How could I not be there for my dear student's big moment?

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.960
Eeeyikes! Is that the time?

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.490
Hurry, hurry! Hurry up!

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.550
I've got to pop in on Kimura-kun, Kanzaki-san,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.640
Chiba-kun, Hayami-san, and Hara-san

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.930
all within the next four minutes!

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.070
Show 'em what you've got!

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.920
Up, up, and awaaay!

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.310
I could never be a teacher like that.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.470
The last career counseling session is at the end of February, after all our entrance exams.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.900
I have until then to make up my mind.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.200
For now, I'll focus on the target before me!

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.960

Assassination Classroom Final Season Kayano Kaede

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.840
Why so antsy, Okajima?

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.170
Oh, uh, nothing.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.540
Valentine's chocolates? For shame.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.880
N-No, it's nothing like that!

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.580
Gross.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:41.310
Rude much? I bet you're only giving out cheap stuff bought in bulk anyway!

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.770
I-I beg your pardon?!

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.550
Oh my, oh my!

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.360
And just who might those be for?

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.750
Wh-What do you mean?

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.030
It's just a formality!

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.800
Th-They could be for anybody!

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.250
Oh? And here I was sure you were giving them to this guy here.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.840
Forgive me! Please forgive me!

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.960
Hiding her true feelings with those ace acting skills...

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.760
I don't think even Korosensei has realized what's been happening with Kayano-chan.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.420
Yet ever since that kiss,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.100
she's been unable to hide her feelings for Nagisa— she's practically cowering in them.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.220
If we put these two together...

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.180
...we can tease two birds with one stone.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.020
We'll be getting ourselves a new toy!

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.440
He doesn't have a great self-image.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.110
Probably can't even imagine a girl having a crush on him.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:37.260
In fact, he feels sorry about the incident, thinking he did something bad to you.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.720
If you don't set him straight, he may never understand how you really feel.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.000
I mean...

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.640
I've acted love tons of times and studied it and stuff,

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.880
but when it comes to the real thing, I have no experience at all!

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.190
Like, what expression should I make when I give him the chocolates?

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.550
Well, let's do some recon.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.140
Time to put all that covert training to work.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.140
Sugino &amp; Kanzaki Sugino &amp; Kanzaki
m 317 316 l 990 316 990 482 317 482

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.560
Yesss! Yesss!

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.020
I'm glad you're so happy.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.980
The recipient, Sugino, is insanely overjoyed,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.020
but the giver, Kanzaki-san, is calm.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.560
Likely given as a formality, no more.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.150
His "insanely overjoyed" is scary as heck.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.160
Chiba &amp; Hayami Chiba &amp; Hayami
m 317 316 l 990 316 990 482 317 482

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.690
Wow.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.490
Your accuracy's dead on, even with chocolate bits.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.590
Here's the rest, as promised.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.670
Thanks.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.250
Respect. Let's keep it up.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.130
Yep.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.790
The firing distance between them is one of a kind, all right.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.470
I can't imitate that... and I can't even tell if her gift's the real deal.

No sweat. I've still got time before the exam for my first choice.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.400
Huh?

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.000
I'm aiming for a public school. The same one as you.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.600
You are? I hope we both get in.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.340
Yeah.

See?

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.910
Everyone has their own whys and hows for this.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.290
Shouldn't you just say what you want to say in your own way?

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.380
Yeah. Thanks, you two.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.250
Now, the problem here...

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.550
is how infuriating it is to be watched by that gossipy octopus.
A couple, a couple! Let the good times roll!

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.780
Leave him to me.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.470
Kayano-chan, did you bring the you-know-what?

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.510
Huh? Oh, yeah.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.440
That ought to lock down Korosensei for us.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.140
Go have a good time giving him that chocolate.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.480
Okay.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.600
Where's my chocolate?! I must have something!

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.960
Someone musta hid it on the mountain!

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.160
Just you watch, Nagisa! I refuse to end this day empty-handed!

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.640
Kayano?

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.610
What's wrong?

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.170
You're being so quiet.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.650
Oh, no... My heart's thumping so hard I can't think!

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.060
How should I look? What should I say when I give him this?

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.930
H-Hey, uh, Nagisa...

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.220
Have you figured out your future plans?

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.030
Well, I kind of have an idea of what I want to be,

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.010
but right now I'm really not sure if I can do it.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.060
A teacher, probably.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.680
I've seen him look admiringly at Korosensei—

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.680
not as a super-organism or an assassin, but as a teacher.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.940
I bet he'll give his answer at the month-end career counseling.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.400
Huh?

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.000
That's Korosensei up in that tree.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.530
He's engrossed in something or other.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.870
Out of range, huh?

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.860
Guess he's not about to make himself a sitting duck.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.440
Oh, that's right.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.880
I've come to love that face of Nagisa's, looking straight ahead.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.000
I was spared from complete emptiness

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.400
after losing my family and my revenge

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.680
because Nagisa killed me.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:20.980
Because the honest bloodlust of this killer toward me

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.910
filled the void in my heart with warmth.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.980
So with what face—with what words—do I give him this?

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:32.980
Nagisa?

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.670
Thank you for staying by my side this whole year.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.530
Here!

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.200
For me?
Yep!

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.880
B-But, I mean, I'm the one who should be thanking you.
Okay, mission accomplished! Well done!

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.780
See you tomorrow!

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.780
Hope you get into that school!

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.250
Uh, yeah...

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.800
Right now, Nagisa is looking straight ahead.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.910
Being next to him, I shouldn't distract him.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.320
But I do want to do something to thank him,

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.400
so I'll use my sharpest blade—my acting—

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.300
to cheer him on with my very best smile.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.580
To kill yourself for someone else at the moment of truth...

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.130
That part of her is a lot like Yukimura-sensei.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.300
Ah, how noble.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.260
No way can I poach from someone so admirable.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.640
Say what?

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.280
Nothing.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.950
And more importantly...

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.100
What, exactly, has Korosensei so enthralled?

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:43.070
Oh, I got Kayano-chan to leave a certain photo along with some chocolates and a note in an obvious location.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.360
 To Korosensei From my sister

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.590
 To Korosensei From my sister A photo?

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.360
 To Korosensei From my sister

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.730
If I'd known it'd work so well, I'd have used it in an assassination.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.640
A top-class dinner on Valentine's Day...

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.620
I should have expected such thoughtfulness from you.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.220
I've heard men have to give back threefold on White Day next month.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.920
I'll accept no less than triple the length and girth,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.880
Ka-ra-su-ma.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.640
I'm out.
Huh?

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.430
Hey, wait! Wait! Stay and eat!

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.300
Regular-sized is just fine!

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.360
I'll even make do with fun-sized!

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.940
Such low-class company for such a high-class place.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.860
Here. It's from Hinano.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.430
She asked me to give it to you,

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.280
since you're barely at school anymore.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.250
Once I see an opening, he's mine!

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.470
Or so she said.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.080
She's reading too much into us. We're not even dating.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.170
And the others?

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.420
There were more chocolates than I'd thought, both obligatory and heartfelt.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.440
Maybe some of them thought it might turn out to be their last Valentine's Day on Earth.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.280
And? What about you?

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.930
How's the assassination going?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.570
"The probability's down to one percent! Hooray!"

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.760
Like it'll end there.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.250
So that's why she booked us a private room at a trustworthy establishment.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.080
Yes. I was planning to talk to you about that.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.990
My main job now is simply to provide guidance to the E Class,

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.620
so they won't bring me into the loop until the moment of truth.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:25.080
But...

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:31.620
There's no doubt that the powers that be are moving forward with a tremendous assassination project.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.120
To see it again like this... it's just amazing.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.530
Can this really kill him?

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:45.080
With this weapon, it's not a matter of whether it can.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.850
What's crucial is just how smoothly and how smartly it'll do the job.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.700
A brutally gorgeous figure for such a virtuous mind...

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:04.990
Not very commendable, seeing one of our teachers laid low by a single swimsuit snapshot.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.630
Mr. Principal, sir! Where'd you come from?!

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.090
There are problems with your work attitude.

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:11.880
I'll be cutting your salary this month.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.090
Have mercy!

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.540
Yukimura-sensei, was it?

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.300
A shame we had to lose such talent.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.150
She had an inexhaustible vitality and such passion for teaching.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.950
Given a few more years, she would have been an outstanding instructor.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.110
Indeed.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:33.780
By the way, I hear there's a chance your life may be saved.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:40.460
If so, would you care to follow in her footsteps and teach here next year as well?

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:45.910
Your artificial-looking expression and physique are well-suited to teaching at this isolated campus.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.160
I'm flattered. Knowing your policy of judging teachers purely on aptitude

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.250
without being led astray by sentiment or one's past,

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.760
a request for me to stay is the best report card I could hope for.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.180
Roll Book Roll Book Roll Book Roll Book Roll Book
But I've decided that this will be my last year at the blackboard.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:04.220
Roll Book

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.680
And after that?

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.190
Who knows? Perhaps I'll sail around the world.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.750
Having you for a rival made this school truly enjoyable for me.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.210
I really must thank you again.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.370
That's too bad.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.440
You turned me down before I could bribe you.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.820
Now that I think about it... I rule this school from the top,

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.480
while you and Yukimura-sensei supported your students from the bottom.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.180
That might just be my educational ideal.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.650
By the way, how's your son?

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.430
Ah, he's putting together a ruling hierarchy for high school.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.900
At this rate, he'll have the whole place under his thumb within the year.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.340
Truly a remarkable young man.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.790
Oh, he's not quite there yet.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.860
There's no end to the ways in which he's still lacking.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.770
You know, Karasuma,

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.610
I think it might not be so bad if the world were destroyed.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.330
For the kids, anyway.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:11.270
If they can't kill him, they'll be left with these nagging feelings of frustration and loss.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.470
Worse, if their teacher were killed in some huge assassination

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.780
that was out of their league and beyond their control...

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.080
Or if they were made to witness their mentor's cruel and painful death

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.540
at the hands of some conflicted assassin...

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.640
I'm frankly frightened.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.220
The frustration, the powerlessness, the trauma...

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.270
No matter how it turned out, such an experience would warp those kids' futures.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:42.410
I don't want to see those blameless brats turn into adults with twisted hearts.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:44.870
Irina.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.880
Once this job is over, quit.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.960
You're not cut out to be an assassin.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.630
What did you say?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.010
Your emotions run too deep.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.560
They've grown fatally so this past year.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.080
If you feel such emotion for your students,

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.470
it'll only make any future jobs that much harder.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.280
A stiff like you can blow it off easily enough,

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.650
this life I've desperately built for myself...

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.230
I've killed a lot, you know.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.760
There's no going back to a place in the sun—

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.160
not with these ten sin-stained years behind me.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.380
Every experience is a tool that can clear your way to the future.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:34.290
It was none other than those students who taught me that.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.280
There's no need to worry about them.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.640
No matter what difficulty they may face,

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.160
the experience they've gained through assassination

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.510
will nourish them as they find their own answers.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.240
Irina, come work for us.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.770
I'm sure your experience will be put to good use in peacetime too.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.300
The Intelligence Department won't ask about your past.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.720
There, you can save more people than you've killed

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.090
and pray for your victims at the shrine every morning.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.770
That's enough.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.160
Shrine?

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.850
I'm technically a Christian, you know.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.200
And I have no family in Japan.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.910
Don't you get it? There aren't any churches near my house.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.720
Whaaat?!

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.980
Wait, Karasuma! What are you saying?!

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:37.500
komorebi ga yasashiku sashikomu ookina mado no naka
As the dappled sunlight shone gently through the window

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.570
Just what I said.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.970
B-But a man and a woman living under one roof is so...

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:33.730
immoral!

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.100
Live alone, then.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.370
No! I'll do it! I'm coming!

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.020
Wait up! Karasuma!

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:47.760
kimi to deatta ano hi wo tooku ni kanjita

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:59.920
The day I met you felt so far away 

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:59.000
sukoshi zutsu narabeta omoi ga boku wo atatameru
The memories I've arranged little by little keep me warm

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:12.020
chiisana heya tsunagu kokoro sotto oshiete kureta
A small room, hearts connecting: you taught me gently

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:24.810
kono kisetsu ga mukae ni kitara kimi no sugata mou sagasu koto mo
Once this season comes for me, I won't be able

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:30.050
dekinaku nacchaun da ne dekinaku nacchaun da ne
To seek you out anymore, will I?

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:35.690
zutto wasurezu ni iru yo zutto wasurezu ni iru yo
But I'll hold your memory in my heart

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:41.670
mata kimi ni aeru hi made mata kimi ni aeru hi made
Until the day I can see you again
