WEBVTT

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.000
we were here on a secret investigation into the truth.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.780
Or so our cover story went.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.370
In fact, we'd infiltrated this cafe a good ways from school just for the heck of it.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.820
Wow, what a man!

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.250
Welcome! Ah, always good to see you,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.230
Harada-san and Itou-san.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.150
How's it going, Yuuma-chan?

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.100
We come here more for you than for the coffee!

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.840
Now, don't say that. Wouldn't want the owner to get sulky.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.840
So, a mocha for you, Harada-san, and a double espresso for you, Itou-san?

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.190
Our manager's special today is a nice chiffon cake.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.560
Ooh! We'll take two.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.850
Thank you very much.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.370
Our leader really is a man among men.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.050
I could kill him.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.120
You're sure making that one cup of tea last a while.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.010
And why shouldn't we? We are keeping your job secret, you know.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.410
I get it. A shakedown, eh?

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.240
If you'll take a second steep, this round's on me.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.660
What a man!

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.900
Carrying all that at once?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.000
What a man!

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.800
Don't tell me your mother's feeling poorly again?

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.880
Yes, well...

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.550
It's just me and Mom, so I have to help out with the money.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.040
What a man!

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.180
Being poor is his only weakness.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.390
And he even turns that into a cool-guy advantage!

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.940
He wears his bargain-basement clothes so neat and clean that they don't look cheap at all.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.940
What a man!

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.810
He let me eat some of the goldfish he caught at the summer festival.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.360
And boy, can he cook a mean goldfish!

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.450
What a man!

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200
And after he used the bathroom?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.700
He left the toilet paper folded into a triangle!

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.910
What a man!

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.410
Hey, I fold toilet paper too!

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.710
Into a triangle!

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.080
Gross!!

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.170
Just look at him. Perfect biddy bait!

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.340
What a man!

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.220
Oh, Nagisa-chan!

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.840
Uh, middle-aged women in my neighborhood dote on me, too.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.840
Like a widdle animal!

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.010
Shape up!

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.390
He's still getting love letters from girls on the main campus.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.600
What a man!

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.390
Well... so am I.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.390
Please accept it!

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.810
Forbidden love!
Forbidden love... Forbidden love...

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.790
Some things only suit cool guys like Isogai-kun... or me.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.760
What a m—

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.780
What are you doing here?!

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.120
The honey toast here is divine!

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.950
It's why I turn a blind eye to Isogai-kun's part-time job.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.320
You don't seem to be too upset about his being such a man among men.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.140
Huh? Well, no.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.740
Why is that?

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.180
Why?

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.050
Well, because he's a good guy. That's all.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.800
Uh-huh!

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.860
Do we need another reason?

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.100
Welcome!

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.630
Oh? Oh, dear!

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.490
Our intel was right. There is a student working here!

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.530
Isogai-kun, you naughty boy!

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.510
This is your second major violation of the school rules.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.820
I expected better of you,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.190
Isogai-kun.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.500
Asano-kun! This couldn't have turned out worse.

5th Period Isogai Yuuma Leader Time

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.320
The last time we caught you working without leave,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.840
you got busted down to the E Class.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.590
It doesn't seem like you've done any soul-searching since then.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.640
Can't you keep this quiet, Asano?

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.190
If I can work for just this month, I'll make all the money I need.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.900
Well, I would like to give you a chance, if I can.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.780
When Asano-kun's up to no good,

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.710
he's a dead ringer for the principal.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.280
Very well—on one condition.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.080
Show me your fighting spirit, and we'll pretend this never happened.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.420
My fighting spirit?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.040
Per school tradition,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.290
those who possess the spirit to fight out in the real world are revered above all else.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.160
You'll need a fighting spirit that garners enough respect to nullify a conduct violation.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.050
And to show that spirit...

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.550
Pole-toppling at the sports festival?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.390
Yep. If we beat the A Class, they'll turn a blind eye.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.930
Bah. They're clearly lookin' to embarrass us.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.650
So what do we do? If we say no, Isogai'll be penalized again.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.720
Worst case, he might even be expelled.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.660
No. You don't have to do this.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.710
You never know what Asano has up his sleeve.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.170
And besides, I got myself into this. I'll take full responsibility for the consequences.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.120
Expel me for all I care!

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.670
I can still pull off an assassination off school grounds!

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.260
Wh-What a...

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.740
What a horrible idea!

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.390
Huh?!

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.920
Quit acting so self-satisfied, you bed-haired bum!

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.620
"Bed-haired bum"?!

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.910
Don't overthink this, Isogai.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.860
We just have to beat those nerds at pole-toppling, right?

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.830
We've got this in the bag!

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.350
We sure do.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.020
We're practically lucky you got caught working!

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.120
This is our chance to pay 'em back for all their daily spite!

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.740
Topple 'em. Hell, we'll destroy 'em!

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.870
Right, man among men?

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.490
You guys...

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.940
Okay, let's do it!

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.040
Yeah!

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.000
This is his M.O.:

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.830
putting the harmony of the class above his own needs.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.710
It all amounts to personal magnetism,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.050
the most essential attribute of a leader.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.780
Now, perhaps a fellow man among men could lend a hand!

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.100
Pole-toppling, eh?

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.520
We did that plenty of times at Defense Academy.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.800
That's no assassination—it's war.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.660
The difference in team size can be a huge handicap.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.500
They're well-trained, but can they beat a team nearly twice as big?

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.830
Entrance Entrance

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.550
Wow! Awesome, Kimura-kun!

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.640
Now, give me an even bigger smile! That's it, Justice!
Korosensei's Weak Point #27:

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.520
Bread is for drinking.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.100
Too cool!

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.630
Yes, assassination has improved your physical fitness,

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.320
balance, kinetic vision, and sense of distance.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.480
This competition provides a special opportunity to showcase all of it.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.370
That's harassment!
Huh?

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.130
Look how fast that runt's crawling through the net!

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.330
Her body's got no air resistance!

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.740
Each student's individuality will be their weapon.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.910
It's up to you how best to use that in pole-toppling, Isogai-kun.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.230
What is it?

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.550
Korosensei, no matter what anyone says,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.060
Asano is one amazing guy.

I'm definitely no match for him.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.180
It's true that no matter how talented you are,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.480
once you're out in the world, there will always be someone better.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.160
Like he is.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.680
What now? If the others get hurt because of me...

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.990
The thing is...

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:38.060
Out in the world, there's only so much one person can do alone.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.160
Yeah!

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.580
The power to command allies into battle:

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.760
that's where you've got Asano-kun beat.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.380
If you ever find yourself in trouble, the others will fight alongside you.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.630
That's your personal magnetism.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.510
And as for me, I'm glad I got to be your teacher instead of Asano-kun's.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.760
All right, everyone!

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.020
Let's go into this guns blazing, like always!

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.730
Yeah!

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.880

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.140
That's gotta be against the rules!

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.250
And in the spirit of cultural exchange,

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.350
this exhibition match will include all our exchange students!

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.120
That Asano jerk's being way too careful.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.380
Does he want to win this badly?

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.390
This is gonna be good.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.260
What will the E Class do now?

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.090
If the E Class wants to win with so few members,

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.020
they'll have to abandon defense and attack—

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.490
at which point our ironclad defense will surround and crush them.

A tight defense is useless if they just get picked off one by one!

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.510
Why don't you fight instead of defending like a bunch of turtles?

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.340
But you don't even understand me, do you?

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.890
It's all right, man.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.010
Why don't you attack instead of chatting away?

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.390
Bring it on!

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.270

Now this is intense! They're playing dirty!

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.910

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.960

You're not goin' anywhere!

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.210
A splendid defense.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:40.010
But you've got seven men strictly on defense, and two are out for the count.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.570
This simply confers us even more of an advantage.

There's a gap right in the middle.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.930
If we're going to attack, it has to be now, while their forces are scattered!

An offensive fake-out?!

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.580
It's like a chess problem.

The Defense Ministry would rather no one get injured.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.900
It's all right. I gave him some tips through our social studies work.

He sent his troops where there were no roads,

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.510
popping up in places where his foe was unprepared.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.300
He thought up defenses and used secret weapons.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.910
Put a touch of the unconventional in all of your strategies.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.770

One thing you always have to watch out for in pole-toppling

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.320
is your opponents clinging to the top, even if it's just a handful of them.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.430

Uh-oh. They're closing in.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.660
At this rate, they'll be surrounded and beaten to a pulp!

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.720
Asano-kun is a strong leader who can singlehandedly decide the tide of battle.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.150
As long as they follow his command, the A Class can't lose.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.360
Isogai-kun, you probably can't be that kind of leader.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.190
And that's because...

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.060
you don't have to make all the decisions yourself!

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.600

Wait a second! Isn't that their defensive unit?

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.620
Which means...

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.300
The E Class only has two men on defense?!

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.120

They seem perfectly happy with that answer.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.800
It's a stall, of course.

Maybe he still has an ace up his sleeve.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.060
I guess it's better to wait for his orders

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.980
before you make any moves.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.650
Damn four-eyes!

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.340
Asano! Your orders!

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.290
I can't give any!

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.540
Now the A Class has assumed a defensive posture too!

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.040
If they can hold out here, the E Class will be out of options!

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:00.910
Now!

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.100
Come on, Itona!

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.120
Yep.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.590
A secret weapon should always be saved for the last minute.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.680
We're losing?

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:34.710
Uh... er... the A Class... The E Class... wins!

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.950
How awesome is that? My kids are the coolest! Look this way, please!

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.090
You did it, Isogai!

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:48.400
Anyone can see that, by some miracle, the E Team won a battle stacked heavily against them.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.960
In other words, you were defeated utterly.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:59.480
lsogai-kun used your strategy against you and ensured victory with a hidden secret weapon.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.680
You had already lost at the intelligence-gathering stage.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.370
You're not fit to be a leader.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.350
Chief Director, Chief Director,

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.730
your son is extremely capable.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.650
Stop it, Kevin!

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.690
As a father, you should tell him

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.440
that there's a lot he can learn from losing.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.610
I see... I see...

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.280
Your little opinion is quite moving, Kevin.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.200
Could you help me learn as well?

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.160
If I were to lose, If I were to lose,

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.000
I might be able to learn from that loss.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.750
All four at once... All four at once...

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.500
please.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.010
Isogai-senpai!

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.890
You were so awesome!

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.140
Hey, thanks!

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.930
Just don't try that at home.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.450
Ohmigosh!
Damn that man-among-men!

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.650
It's like the whole mood's changed around here.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.700
Especially with how the lower grades see the E Class now.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:59.320
Well, sure, with our little team's huge upset!

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.780
You know...

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.030
we might even be more amazing than Asano and his gang!

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.840
Sorry... I'm sorry... I apologize...

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.090
I took down a karate black belt

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.640
on my third day of karate lessons.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.660
The first day, I was beaten completely.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.050
Already in my thirties, I fell over, vomiting.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.080
I had never tasted such defeat.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.680
Now, what do you think I did on day two?

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:41.130
I watched, burning with the flames of extraordinary humiliation.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.040
If I lost my next match, too...

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:49.180
I'd probably lose my grip on myself and die of madness.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:55.960
And on day three... I took down my teacher without him landing a single blow.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.220
That is learning from defeat.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.330
Say, Asano-kun...

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.130
You just lost, so why isn't the frustration eating you alive?

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.540
You monster!

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.800
Hey, check it out...

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.520
Oh... It's Asano-kun.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.720
Hey, Asano!

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.790
You meant it, right? About keeping that secret?

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.270
I never lie.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.290
I don't resort to underhanded tactics, unlike you.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.410
But next time will be different.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.270
I'll send you all into oblivion.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.270
Heh. Sore loser.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.310
Did the loser say something? Can't hear you!

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:53.520
Don't sweat it. He could never understand your struggle.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:59.270
No, it's not like I've gone through any more than he has.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.940
Today, with all of you helping me out,

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.860
I was actually glad to be poor.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.700
Shake it off, Asano-kun. Let's go tie this up with a fancy dinner.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.320
He may not be as showy as Asano-kun,

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.760
but Isogai-kun's not in front or on top—

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.210
he's beside you before you know it.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.210
Whoa! Leftovers from the bread-eating contest!

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.130
The president of Class 3-E
Think I could have these? Huh?

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.820
is a cool, manly assassin and a born leader.
I know! I'll make goldfish sandwiches!

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:40.320
The moon that floats in the night sky
yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.550
If you stretch out your hand, you can reach it
te wo nobaseba todoku no te wo nobaseba todoku no

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:51.950
I went to touch it: it was warm

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:56.160
sotto furete mita atatakakute And slowly drew me in

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:56.160
And slowly drew me in jinwari suikomareta
jinwari suikomareta

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:07.940
The multiplying footprints, the view from my window
fueteku ashiato mado kara miru keshiki mo

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:14.050
As I drifted along, expressionless
muhyoujou ni nagare nagara muhyoujou ni nagare nagara

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:18.480
They spilled out of my hands ryoute kara koborete yuku
ryoute kara koborete yuku

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:25.400
It was rocking, swaying... I never knew
yurayura yureteta shirazu ni ita

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:30.900
Until I touched it with my own hands
kono te de furete miru made kono te de furete miru made

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:36.280
I want to gather up and go through all of the things
kaketa tsuki no shita chirabatta mono

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:43.670
Scattered beneath the waning moon
