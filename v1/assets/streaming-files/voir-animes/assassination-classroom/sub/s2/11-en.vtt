WEBVTT

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.650
We put forth all of our efforts.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.110
We're satisfied with our victory in the school festival.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.070
Oh?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.990
It seems to have been a very close one.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.630
Only because the E Class had a battle plan.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.360
Winning by a huge margin would have been nearly im—

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.340
Incorrect.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.080
They were running a restaurant.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.990
It's easy enough to spread nasty rumors,

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.820
and a case of food poisoning would have ruined them.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.260
You neglected the more... harmful options.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.640
Is he for real?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.970
"Harmful"? Were we supposed to poison the E Class's food?!

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.810
Sir, your education is flawed.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.720
I don't know how,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.770
but the E Class has grown stronger by leaps and bounds in just one year—

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.780
enough to compete with us, the chosen A Class.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.230
As irritating as it is, I feel my abilities have grown as well.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.700
I cannot deny that they have become my motivation.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.350
These mighty foes, my min—

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.440
I mean, friends—such connections have made me stronger.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.750
You were totally going to say "minions"!

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.100
One does not become strong by winning over the weak.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.220
That's my conclusion—and it is where I diverge from the path you teach.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.180
Asano-kun, could you leave us for about three minutes?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.130
I'd like to speak with your four friends here.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.650
You know. Just a little chat.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.360
Go on, Asano-kun. What's three minutes?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.620
What's going on?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.450
You may enter, Asano-kun.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.260
Ren! Seo!

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.630
Kill the E Class, kill the E Class, kill the E Class...

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.670
What... What did you...

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.640
I merely fanned the flames of their hatred.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.230
It only takes a whispered word or three for those "connections" of yours to collapse.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.580
The strength I teach is nothing so fragile.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.370
I'll handle the end-of-term finals.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.530
Without strength, you lack both meaning and merit.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.380
I'll teach you exactly that—from square one.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.320
For as long as I can remember,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.860
my house has been a classroom.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.080
My father was the teacher... and I his student.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.690
And when he had nothing in particular to teach me,

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.750
we didn't talk at all.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.040
Oh, stop here, please.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.950
Yes, sir.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.280
Hey.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.250
Good to see you're as well as ever.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.290
This town, though... Change is in the air. I can feel it.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.540
Times like these, I stand to make a good sum of money...

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.660
so here's some pocket change for you too.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.930
For your favorite game of chance.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.270
That's the only way you can feel the joy of being alive—

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.980
though I am the one who taught you that.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.650
Just a moment, here.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.110
Could you repeat that?

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.570
I need another billion.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.320
This assassination is really warming up, wouldn't you say?

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.280
Who knows what could happen.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.400
I must consider the risks to my students...

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.490
and it costs money to keep secrets.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.350
I've lived here a long time, so I can tell.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.500
You're moving ahead with a major plan of some sort.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.480
But that doesn't mean—

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.810
Enough, Sonokawa.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.540
How many times will we be shaken down for more hush money?

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.220
By the time March rolls around, we'll have paid him more than the bounty!

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.140
Remember, he's graciously allowing us to use this school.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.220
Wire it to my account, if you please.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.670
What shrewd instincts.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.740
He even picked up on the final assassination project in progress here.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.590
He's quite a man,

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.820
having the entire Ministry of Defense in the palm of his hand.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.160
All right, it's time to show what we've done for the past year.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.920
Next up is the classwork battle.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.430
Are you prepared to take the top spot, Karma-kun?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.090
Gee, I dunno. Idiots like me don't understand hard stuff.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.880
For your first-term midterms,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.640
I gave everyone the goal of making the top fifty.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.370
I apologize for that.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.590
I was too impatient for results,

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.150
and I didn't count on your opponents being so strong.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.640
But things are different now.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.140
You've matured in mind and spirit.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.780
You should be able to meet your goals in the face of any plot or setback.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.520
With heads held high, you will all make the top fifty,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.660
you will receive your tickets back to the main campus,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.300
and you will graduate as the E Class.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.300
If only it were that easy.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.160
Huh?

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.750
The A Class has a new teacher...

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.840
and you won't believe who it is.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.440
As of today, I'll be taking over your lessons.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.840
Good luck, A Class.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.060
So that's what it's come to.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.930
Honestly, I want no part of his brainwashing curriculum.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.030
His weird charisma, controlling people with a word or a glance...

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.740
His teaching skills put him on a par with our Mach-20 Korosensei.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.490
Nrrrgh!

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.500
If he's their teacher...

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.690
then they've probably already lost the will to defy him.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.710
It's ten times easier to understand than our usual lessons...

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.210
but twenty times faster!

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.570
Hashizume-kun, Tanaka-kun, Fujii-san, Kondou-san, Okuno-san...

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.890
You seem a little behind.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.550
Huh?

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.680
How can he tell with his back to us?!

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.380
l-lt's just too fast!

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.750
Maybe if we were at the Big Five's level, but this is impossible for us!

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.020
You think it's impossible because you don't understand why you must fight.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.650
Why don't you join me in the hallway for three minutes?

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.360
Let's have a little chat.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:05.170
Kill the E Class, kill the E Class, kill the E Class...

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.000
Your studies are not just for your own sake.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.060
You will grow even more powerful than the E Class has, and you will demolish them.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.340
And when the lower grades witness your glorious victory,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.320
they'll know you, the A Class, are the ones in the right,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.600
and they will aspire to join your ranks.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.100
Your hard work will elevate all of humanity.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.070
Oh, and Asano-kun? You can go home and study on your own.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.090
With your skills, you'll retain the top spot if you simply stay on your guard.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.340
I will lead your other classmates upward.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.290
You know, they're kind of similar—

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.300
the principal and Korosensei.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.470
How so?

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.470
They both have extraordinary powers, but they're just regular teachers.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:02.780
With the principal's quick wits, he could have been prime minister or a business bigshot.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.100
But he's devoted himself to education at just one academy.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.160
No wonder he's so unrelenting.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.540
Huh? It's Asano-kun.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.750
What do you want?

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.510
You're not the kind of guy who'd run recon on us.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.870
It pains me to say this... but I have a request.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.150
I'll cut to the chase.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.000
That monster...

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.210
I want you to kill him.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.620
Not physically, of course.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.470
Kill his educational policies.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.350
His education policies? Like... how?

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:50.800
Easy. I want you, the E Class, to dominate the top spots in the next end-of-term exams.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.960
I'll be in first place, of course,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.320
but excellent grades mean nothing coming from an excellent student.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.350
For detritus like you to surpass the A Class, though—

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.040
that would ruin his stance on education.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.670
Asano-kun, I've heard about the chilly relationship between you two.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.500
Are you trying to attract his attention by denying his methods?

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.510
Don't misunderstand.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.720
"Be strong enough to kick even your father down."

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.470
That's what he always taught me... and that has been my guiding philosophy.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.390
I don't know about anyone else, but that's always been our parent-child relationship.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.420
However, I can't say the same for the other, lesser students.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.420
Right now, A Class is hell.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.730
That is all for today.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.820
Remember to review.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.490
Kill the E Class, kill the E Class, kill the E Class...

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.300
He's making them study far beyond their limits, with only their hatred of the E Class to sustain them.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.620
If they win like that,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.820
it'll be the only method they'll trust from now on.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.270
You can only gain so much strength through hating, scorning, and misleading your foes.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.310
Even opponents like you will still give them trouble.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.620
They'll still be my flunkies in high school.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.880
But if my flunkies' strength is lopsided,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.400
they won't be able to support me, the ruler.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.720
Sometimes defeat can open one's eyes.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.250
So please, show my friends and my father a proper defeat.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.910
He's not hiding his arrogant nature,

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.410
because he's speaking from his heart.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.140
This big ball of pride named Asano-kun is bowing to us.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.660
He's really, truly worried about someone who isn't him.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.500
Huh? Is this really the time to be worrying about others?

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.570
You're not taking first place. I am.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.890
I told you: next time the E Class won't go easy on you.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.200
I'll be number one, with the rest of the class right under me.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.780
I'd say tenth place or so should suit you, Asano-kun.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.710
Ooh, Karma said it! He's taking first place!

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.830
Just don't let it turn out like it did last time.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.170
At least try to do better than me, okay?

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.520
Asano,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.950
we've been trying our best to win all along,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.560
and this time is no exception.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.850
That's how it's always been for both us and the A Class.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.170
We're happy if we win, frustrated if we lose.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.520
No need for ranks beyond that.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.980
Isn't that enough?

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:41.120
We'll do our best so you can all be glad you had the chance to take us on.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.360
Don't overthink it.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.620
Just come at us like you want to kill us.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.120
That's what makes it fun.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.880
How amusing. Then I'll fight with my gloves off, too.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.000
Th-These are all for the math exam?!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.720
Yeah, the principal said to put together the hardest questions out of all this material.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.460
And this is a junior-high exam?!

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.220
You could get into a mediocre college with this!

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.810
How high is he trying to raise the students' level?

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.780
Hmm?

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.980
Ah, it's unusual to see you here.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.290
I haven't done anything wrong, Korosensei.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:26.200
Yes, I know. You always prefer orthodox methods in the end.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.860
You wouldn't resort to cheap tricks this late in the game.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.120
This will most likely be our last educational battle.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.590
Here. Consider it a thank-you for accepting the challenge from me here as I am.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:45.760
Korosensei, this is the first school you've taught at, correct?

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.630
How can you tell?

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.010
You're a bit amateurish.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.730
You won't say a word about why you became a teacher...

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.940
Perhaps you'll tell me once I win.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.020
There’s not much to tell.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:07.990
Broadly speaking, there are only two reasons a person feels the desire to teach something:

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.700
either he wants to pass on his successes,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.510
or he wants to warn of his failures.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.620
Which is it for you, Principal Asano?

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.640
I wonder.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.900
The second-term finals were one week away.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.350
We studied our butts off,

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.770
asking Korosensei's clones anything we didn't understand.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.020
He had his tentacles so full with us

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.750
that his clones got really bent out of shape.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.220
Then the day of battle arrived.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.830
Kill the E Class, kill the E Class, kill the E Class...

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.290
That's a hell of a look in their eyes.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.200
The A Class is probably psyching themselves up.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.920
You sure you can beat 'em, Karma?

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.260
Who knows?

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.340
If any of them really do plan to kill me, that might slow me down.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.100
It was time for the fated showdown between students

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.890
whose bloodlust had been cultivated by two monsters.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.020
We prepared to slay each other on this paper battlefield!

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.140
If we got shoddy results here...

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.910
we probably wouldn't be able to hold our heads high

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.450
even if we did pull off the assassination.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.450
In our assassination classroom,

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.950
where we kill and our teacher teaches,

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.870
we had found our second blades—just as he taught us.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.420
If we couldn't tell our target as much,

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.880
we couldn't graduate!

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.710
Time's up!

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.560
It's no good. I couldn't get through 'em.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.350
Not only are the questions hard, there are way too many!

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.400
The listening comprehension test was insane.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.730
Even Bitch-sensei doesn't have that kind of vocabulary!

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.780
It's only the first exam, and we're already exhausted.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.950
And English was my best subject!

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.120
Uh-oh. These exams are the real deal.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.660
The grade-average line must be far lower than ever before.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.010
If even one person in our grade manages to get a perfect score, it'll be a miracle.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:36.600
Which means these exams will make our standings perfectly clear!

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.500
Take that!

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.230
So how's the A Class doing?

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.400
I peeked in on 'em during the break,

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.360
and boy, were they seething.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.360
They were insanely focused on the test!

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.570
I guess that's how strong the power of hatred can be.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.320
Never mind that! Look out!

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.530
We have ourselves to worry about!

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.910
Ritsu-san?!

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.340
I heard all about it. We all gotta make the top fifty.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.350
Who're you?

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.720
Oh, it's the fake Ritsu-san.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.970
The real Ritsu-san broke it down like this:

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:28.810
reaching that goal hinges on lower-scorers like me working hard.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.750
We're just gonna have to go for it!

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.740
Begin!

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.740
With the unusual number and difficulty of these questions,

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.210
you have to decide how to pace yourself the second you see them.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.580
If you hesitate about where to strike,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.060
you'll be cornered before you know it.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.420
Seems the one we were most worried about is doing all right.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.430
Is Terasaka for real?

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.740
It's a die probability problem.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.010
He's crushing it by using brute force to go through all the potential answers one by one.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.970
Aren't you supposed to use a combination formula?

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:11.070
Nah, that's a good strategy for a simple, honest lunkhead like him.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.160
If you hesitate while fishing around for efficiency,

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.950
sometimes it's faster to score the first strike and crush them all the second you see the question.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.370
When you're faced with this here and this here,

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.410
don't hesitate—just use the strategy I've just taught you.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.940
Simplicity is your forte.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.850
A feat of strength like this suits you best! Squish squish!

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.090
That damn octopus!

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.260
Just 'cause I'm an idiot don't mean he can treat me like one!

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.370
We could stand to learn from that uncool display of his.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:40.220
Yeah.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.060
We are the End Class, after all!

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.060
No time for acting cool—we gotta do it quick and dirty!

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.190
Zero in on our target's weakness right away.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.730
The more you hit it, the weaker it'll get!

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.820
Even if you don't get the right answer...

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.360
...if your approach is correct...

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.930
...you can at least pick up...

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.490
...partial credit!

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.500
All right! That probably did the trick!

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.480
No time to review! Move on! Next!

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.720
Hey, now...

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.760
Recurrence relations, right before the end?!

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.950
I thought they only existed in rumors.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.220
How could one show up on a junior-high exam?!

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.290
Yikes! Mayday, mayday!

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.200
M-My ammo's not ready!

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.820
I-It's not working!

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.000
Karma!

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.050
You have to take it to a particular solution.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.470
I taught you how last week.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.890
In addition to lectures,

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.650
this time I had the students instruct each other in their strongest subjects.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:18.160
By teaching someone else, you deepen your own understanding—

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.240
and, more than anything, you strengthen teamwork along the way.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.090
It had an immediate effect on Karma-kun in particular,

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.490
patching over his gaps and giving him a more perfect finish.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.320
But that Asano boy's an overachiever, too.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.410
Yes.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.670
No longer the one responsible for improving his class,

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:41.480
he put those efforts into polishing his own blade instead.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.590
That's another way to attain strength.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.050
Even I don't know which is better.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.920
Everyone, just calm down and solve it.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.020
You should at least get partial credit.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.950
I'll get a full-marks answer in your place.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.980
Now, then... How shall I finish him off?
