00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.650
Antimatter: a mere tenth of a gram of it releases as much energy as a nuclear bomb.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.650
Yanagisawa's research had enabled a self-sustaining antimatter generation system

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.530
by incorporating particle acceleration cycles into a living organism.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.060
And the legendary assassin once known as "The Reaper" was their guinea pig.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.420
The antimatter energy that had begun circulating within his body

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.630
replaced his body tissue with tough, flexible structures.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.240
Yanagisawa called them "tentacles" and, fearing them, reinforced the restraint table

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.480
and left the dangerous job of monitoring him entirely to Yukimura Aguri.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.930
As such, she learned of him.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.480
She learned that the Reaper knew neither his real name nor his own birthday,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.700
and that his kind words and smiles were studied behavior—the means to a kill.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.000
And he, too, learned of her.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.750
He learned that there was no love between her and her fiancé, Yanagisawa,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.370
and that she had a little sister— a keen actor—of whom she was proud.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.250
It had already been nearly a year since the two had met.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.240
Along the way, that room had become a place for them to exchange words—and more.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.930
16th Period Kurahashi Hinano Past Time

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.520
Oh, right! Check out the new undershirt I bought today!

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.530
You never learn, do you?

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.610
Your tasteless clothes only make you less attractive as a woman, you know.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.780
Ta-da! An ogre-patterned tube top!

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.170
It's a tad tight, but way stylish, right?

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.210
Um...

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.420
It is kinda weird, isn't it?

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.790
I just thought it was cute, so...
No, no! This is, uh...

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.090
Could this be a side-effect of the experiments?

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.550
Those are some honest tentacles you have there.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.220
The way those hands can take on any shape—

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.380
they just might reflect who you yourself would like to be.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.270
Me?

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.650
Had you been born into a more peaceful world,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.650
you'd have been smart, but slightly perverted, a tad goofy, petty, headstrong,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.160
and able to pull off a genuinely kind smile.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.760
Hey, Akari, I found some time this evening. Want to grab dinner?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.280
Before we talk about that, what's got you sounding so cheerful?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.840
You find yourself a new boyfriend?

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.180
Wh-What are you saying? I'm engaged!

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.950
Who cares? Cut that two-faced tyrant loose already.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.940
Listen here...

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.850
But sure. I gotta hear about this guy who's caught your eye.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.350
So we're on?

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.900
Yup! Your treat!

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.030
Sheesh...

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.440
A present?

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.130
Uh-huh. You were saying your neck was cold.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.410
This covers a good-sized area, and it looks pretty snazzy to boot.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.810
Uh, thanks.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.120
I see you find it unsatisfactory.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.430
No, it's just... Why a present out of the blue?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.940
As of today, it's been one year since I met you.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.840
If you don't know your own birthday, why don't we make it today?

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.930
You've told me so many things and lent me your ear so many times.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.490
So please at least let me give you a birthday in exchange.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.620
I'd be glad to.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.140
That's great!

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.490
But I guess I can't give you this, huh.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.300
Not as long as this wall's between us. And...

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.760
Yanagisawa-san wants me to quit my job to work here full-time.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.210
The students in my last E Class...

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.140
I never did manage to put that spark in most of their eyes after all.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.340
I have a long way to go before I can help these new kids, and yet...

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.640
But my students really are all good kids!

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.040
They're all so unique, and earnest, and genuine!

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.540
And that's why I want to keep helping them.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.070
Because I love my job. Because I love my students.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.440
Mr. Reaper...

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.910
I wish we could touch each other.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.920
You've been my rock.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.330
I want you to give me the strength to hang in there this final year.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.980
Before he knew it, his false smile had become the real thing.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.330
It's all right. You can do it.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.640
Yeah.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.730
The first time they touched

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.490
was three hours before the crescent moon came to be.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.030
The moon?!

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.230
Yes! Seventy percent of it has been destroyed!

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.950
A lab rat on the lunar surface discharged a burst of antimatter energy!

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.910
So cell division exceeded natural limits, eh?

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.050
Calculate the day this same phenomenon would occur in a human!

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.750
Yes, sir!

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.660
Here it is: March 13th next year!

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.970
That's the day not only he, but our entire world will be destroyed.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.270
What will we do, sir?

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.640
Do I really have to say?

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.960
We put him down.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.520
It should be simple if we can just stop his heart.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.150
Notify the U.S. headquarters at once!

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.930
Yes, sir!

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.030
Doomed to a cursed death. A fitting fate for me, I suppose.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.640
Don't give up hope! There may be a way to save—

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.500
But since I have this power and all...

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.530
This is goodbye, Aguri.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.600
I'm leaving this place.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.620
A little earlier than planned, but this much power should do just fine.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.680
At least for this place.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.220
No! No more evil!

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.180
I want us to just stay—

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.390
You'd stop me?

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.430
Yes!

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.410
You? How?

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.060
With those puny arms of yours? That feeble brain?

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.610
Unless your abilities transcend mine, you can't stop me or save me.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.240
You're not even worth taking hostage.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.040
Now, leave before you die a pointless death.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.230
This is Yukimura. Unlock door 1.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.770
All right.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.600
Time to try out the powers I gained in return for that eternity of hellish torture!

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.800
What happened to the security system?!

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.840
It's not working!

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.340
A powerful mucus is jamming the sentry gun panels shut!

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.290
Much obliged, Yanagisawa.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.570
Your efforts have secured me this invincible body—

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.300
though of course, I'd say I deserve partial credit.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.710
Is he saying he gamed the experiment?!

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.130
Koutarou-san! You have to help him, or else—

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.200
You bitch!

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.610
Do you fall for any man who comes along?

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.440
Is this how you thank me for taking you in?

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.670
How dare you! How dare either of you!

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.900
Damn it!

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.610
Get the guards together and intercept him!

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.030
Don't push your luck, guinea pig.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.010
And don't think we were always only about the experiments.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.010
Fire!

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.550
If all you're after is a ruptured aorta...

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.490
a single grain of sand will do the trick.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.530
I could have killed the likes of you at any time.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.780
Tentacle mines!

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.900
A byproduct of antimatter-generating organisms...

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.360
Just attach sensors to control them,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.820
and they become weapons attacking at subsonic speeds—

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.060
transplant them into people, and they grant superhuman battle powers!

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.130
You'll need more than that...

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.840
to do me in.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.800
K-Kill him!

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.890
Surround him! Exterminate him!

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.430
Drop the reinforced acrylic!

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.980
I'll die in a year no matter what I do.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.060
It hardly matters if it's here or elsewhere.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.190
And I don't mind taking the Earth with me, either.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.110
No!

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.220
If you go down that path,

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.830
there's no coming back!

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.760
He could see everything.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.420
He thought he could see everything.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.880
But her being there, seeing him...

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.630
That was something he could not see.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.600
Aguri!

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.740
Now I've done it.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.320
I never would've thought that trap would just spring out like that.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.140
Why...

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.090
I had the feeling... my voice wouldn't be enough to stop you.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.660
If I'd noticed just 0.1 seconds earlier, I could have protected her.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.900
If I'd practiced using my tentacles to heal instead of harm, I could have saved her.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.050
I had more than enough time to notice, so why...

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.510
Why didn't I use my deadly, destructive strength to help someone?

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.710
Why? Why?!

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.890
I might as well have killed you myself.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.180
That's not... true at all.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.640
I just did... what I wanted to do.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:15.030
Besides... I don't mind dying... if it's for you.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.670
That's how important you are to me.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.980
One day, I'm sure you'll meet someone like that too.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.160
If you were the one to kill me, I'd have no regrets.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.260
But how could there be anyone else like you?

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.660
In the year you have left...

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.460
If you're willing to give up your time... go teach those children.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:52.100
Like you... they're wandering in the darkness.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.960
If you can look them in the eye, I'm sure...

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.180
What splendid tentacles.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.370
With hands like these,

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.790
I'm sure you'll be a splendid teacher.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:34.520
I want to keep listening to your story

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:47.840
Just like this, forever Just like this, forever

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:38.910
So uncool.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.130
I only just realized.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.280
Her faults are also part of her charm.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:14:00.710
Though I know time changes everything

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.180
I'll use the time I have left to be a teacher.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.640
To keep looking, with my eyes,

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:14.250
I want to believe in something that won't ever fade away

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.280
at the students you've been watching.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.940
I won't give up on any of them, no matter what.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:26.230
If there's a light illuminating the path of the traveler

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.930
The tentacles asked me what I wanted to be.
I will visit at a later date to negotiate.
Signed, a super-destructive being.
Kunugigaoka Junior High Class 3-E.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:25.340
I will withdraw for now,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.930
but I am willing to take over as homeroom teacher for
To whom it may concern, I will withdraw for now,

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:31.820
Who wanders the darkness Who wanders the darkness

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.800
I wanted to be weak.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:38.230
It must be someone's eyes It must be someone's eyes

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.120
To be riddled with weaknesses, easy to talk to...

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.190
To be able to perceive the weak, protect them, guide them...

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:46.110
Gazing straight ahead Gazing straight ahead

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.400
To be that kind of creature—

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.330
that kind of teacher.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.840
To me, it's you To me, it's you Sometimes I'd be wrong.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.840
Sometimes my cold-hearted true face could even show.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.160
But I'd give it my all.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.230
You were that light You were that light

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.120
I'd aim for her goal in my own way—the way I do best.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:03.800
I am the waning moon I am the waning moon

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:20.980
You found for me the loneliness Within hesitation

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:15.860
Within hesitation That's my story.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.020
The one who taught me to be a teacher

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.330
was Yukimura Aguri-sensei.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.360
To truly look at the people before oneself

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.400
An unexpected tear An unexpected tear

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.990
and respect them as equal human beings,

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.090
not judge them solely on their weaknesses...

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:35.790
Spills from my eye Spills from my eye

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.050
I learned the fundamentals of being a teacher from her.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:47.760
Blurring the moon's light Blurring the moon's light

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:43.390
I added my own knowledge and experience and prepared to face you all.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.340
I would use my abilities to the fullest

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.800
to give you the very best growth and development possible.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.710
But how best to do that?

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.350
I racked my brain...

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:04.130
and finally settled on the assassination classroom, where I'd use what remained of my life.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.020
It had been nine months since Korosensei came to the E Class.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.940
We'd all grown by leaps and bounds.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.570
He really was the best teacher we could have.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.580
After Korosensei had talked for half an hour

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.080
about the real reasons for which he'd become a teacher,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.880
our minds were flooded with memories of our time with him.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.370
The frightening times,

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.260
the infuriating times,

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.640
the happy times, the fun times,

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.570
the fun times,

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.140
the fun times...

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:49.770
Now, for the first time, we realized the formidable challenge we'd had thrust upon us.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:56.060
Did we have to kill this teacher of ours?

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.910
Say, Karasuma...

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.650
Do you really know what it means to kill?

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.960

Assassination Classroom Final Season Shiota Nagisa

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.980
The explosion was projected for the coming March 13th—

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.820
which, coincidentally enough, happened to be Kunugigaoka Junior High's graduation day.

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:27.900
We rang in the new year. Now it was January 6th.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.610
The number of students who spent winter break plotting assassinations

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.420
was precisely zero.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.120
How're you doing, Kaya—

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.890
Yukimura-san?

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.490
Kayano's fine.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.540
I don't mind the name Kayano Kaede at all.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.780
So much for your winter break, huh? Not to mention the holidays.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.600
I'll make it back just in time for the new term.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.460
How were the rest of you?

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.010
None of us could even bring up the subject of assassination.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.660
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.460
Now that I know the truth, I've gotten some closure, but...

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.180
Now the rest of you know all about Korosensei's past.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.620
Don't blame yourself, Kayano.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.780
We all had to find out sometime.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.580
We tried so hard not to face facts...

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:26.560
so that we could enjoy our assassinations for even just a little longer.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.360
Everyone's probably spent the break thinking

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.180
about how we can face our assassination classroom from now on.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.610
Oh, and I need to apologize to you. About what I did that night.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:40.320
I'm sorry!

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.140
That was the only thing I could come up with in the heat of the moment.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.320
Are you mad?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.080
Of course not! You saved me.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.070
All I can do is thank you.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.280
Thank goodness! If you'd said we were through...

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.540
You worry too much. We'll be friends forever, okay?

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.710
We should get going. Kayano-san must be exhausted.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.410
You're right.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.700
Bye, Kayano.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.610
See you in a couple days.
Later!

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:12.990
Uh-huh...

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.250
What's up, Kanzaki-san?

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.900
She'd been watching the class from somewhat of a distance,

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.470
but now I feel like she's finally joined us in the same place.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.190
Why, that...

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.560
That move of his basically conquered my entire being!

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.370
Now that I know about that... how can I ever act again?

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.840
I thought I was the number-one assassin in our class.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.060
Sure, I only had a regular human body,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.910
but with my tentacles and instantaneous firepower,

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.910
there was no way anyone could ever get the better of me.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.360
And yet...

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.730
I got shot through the heart, easy as pie.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.320
I'm utterly defeated.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:05.870
There's no better assassin in our class than Nagisa.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.890
I guess now I have to play the part of his friend.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.690
The third term is upon us, class!

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.150
64 Days Till the Earth's Destruction!
Nurufufufu!
Boom!
3rd Term Begins!
Let's play hard and kill hard this year, too.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.560
You must have known this would happen.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.390
That they'd be like this.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.500
Especially now, with the heavy burden you've put on them...

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.880
Can you still carry out your duties as a teacher?

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.520
If I weren't prepared to be as flexible as the situation demanded,

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.180
I wouldn't have become a teacher in the first place.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.020
The most foolish kill

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.520
is to kill recklessly, out of emotion or greed.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.220
That's what animals do.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.590
Bitch-sensei...

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:07.230
The next most foolish is to kill your feelings while you kill your target,

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.880
giving up so very much— far in excess of your reward.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.180
Like I did.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.620
You really need to think this through, kids,

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:21.620
so you won't kill off the feelings you hold most dear.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:38.290
komorebi ga yasashiku sashikomu ookina mado no naka
As the dappled sunlight shone gently through the window

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:29.890
So... what?

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.470
It ain't like you to be callin' us all together like this,

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.560
Nagisa.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.860
There's something I'd really like to discuss.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.950
What is it?

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:48.550
kimi to deatta ano hi wo tooku ni kanjita
The day I met you felt so far away

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.500
I don't know if it's even possible,

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.940
but I want to find a way to save Korosensei's life.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:59.790
sukoshi zutsu narabeta omoi ga boku wo atatameru
The memories I've arranged little by little keep me warm

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:12.810
chiisana heya tsunagu kokoro sotto oshiete kureta
A small room, hearts connecting: you taught me gently

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:25.600
kono kisetsu ga mukae ni kitara kimi no sugata mou sagasu koto mo
Once this season comes for me, I won't be able

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.840
dekinaku nacchaun da ne dekinaku nacchaun da ne
To seek you out anymore, will I?

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:36.480
zutto wasurezu ni iru yo zutto wasurezu ni iru yo
But I'll hold your memory in my heart

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:42.460
mata kimi ni aeru hi made mata kimi ni aeru hi made
Until the day I can see you again
