00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.320
What brings us together here today— during a school break, no less—

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.160
Undelivered Eggs To Be Discarded
A Poultry Farmer's Opinion
National Overproduction of Eggs

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.510
is the nation's current egg glut, in which excess eggs,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.160
rather than being sent to market, are being discarded in bulk.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.840
Oh, yeah, I heard about that on the news.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.290
What a waste!

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.280
Right?

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.090
So I came up with a plan to salvage those discarded eggs and assassinate Korosensei.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.090
My Plan (Secret)

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.800
Assassinate him with eggs?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.740
Psh. So you cook up a dish and toss in a few of these babies?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.010
Like he won't see straight through it.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.260
My Plan (Secret)

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410
I gave it a little more thought than that.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.730
The initial preparations are already in place, thanks to Karasuma-sensei.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.580
Yes, everything's all set up in the yard—

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.520
To the yard, everyone!

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.180
Honestly. These kids come up with the craziest things.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.140
This mold and those eggs... Don't tell me...

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.580
Yep! We're gonna make one gigantic pudding!

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.910
I call it...

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.390
Operation Pudding Popper!

Operation Pudding Popper?

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.710
Korosensei does have a sweet tooth.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.520
About that!

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.730
I've already obtained a crucial confession!

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.690
Couldn't you just eat these puddings forever?

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.560
You bet I could!

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.810
Someday, I'd love to just dive into a pudding that's even bigger than me!

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.040
But I don't have that kind of money, so I guess it will remain but a fantasy.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.120
Let's make his impossible dream come true!

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.930
To be honest, I'd like a piece of that pudding too!

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.640
We'll embed bombs and anti-teacher pellets into the giant pudding's base.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.870
And when he gets down to the bottom...

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.800
It might be worth a try.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.850
He does tend to go crazy over sweets and sexy stuff.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.780
And with Kayano stepping forth from the background,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.060
My Plan (Secret)

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.060
there's an element of surprise, too.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.150
Okay, let's make the most of the time that he's absent

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.330
and go for broke!

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.780
Yeah!

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.480
I used an inactive line at a mayonnaise factory

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.370
to prep the beaten eggs that'll be going in this giant mold.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.060
But outside a certain level of governmental cooperation,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.500
we'll be doing the rest of the cooking ourselves!

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.170
First, we mix in sugar and milk.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.060
Vanilla oil brings out the flavor.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.220
But, Kaede-chan, they tried to make a giant pudding on TV once, and it didn't work.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.520
It was too big, so it collapsed under its own weight.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.840
To combat that, we're mixing in both agar and gelatin as coagulants.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.190
The agar's fiber will make it stronger.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.640
Plus, agar's higher melting point means it stays intact longer in heat,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.130
so the pudding should stay firm, even outside in September.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.580
Whoa...

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.110
Pour in the first batch of pudding!

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.970
That's the way! Once that's all in, swap with Unit Two!

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.180
Then what are these?

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.520
Bursts of flavor: fruit sauce and mousse in edible starch wrappers.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.270
Wouldn't you get sick of the same flavor all the way through?

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.000
Adding these in here and there will provide some variety.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.420
Once the mold is full, put on the lid and let it chill.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.450
The mold's outer walls are equipped with a refrigeration function,

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.210
and the pipes inside are flowing with coolant.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.090
A pudding this voluminous needs to be cooled inside and out.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.670
Wow...

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.240
Just how much does Kayano know about pudding, anyway?

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.390
She's got the scientific theory down, and she's studied up on flavor!

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.080
Way to go, Kayano-chan.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.040
You planned and executed all this yourself after seeing that article on eggs?

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.850
Uh-huh!

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.240
I mean, I've wanted to try it for a while.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.170
With the Ministry of Defense covering the cost,

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.300
I figured this was the perfect opportunity.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.490
Once I put my mind to something, I just keep on rolling.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.860
Kayano was always behind us, helping out with our assassinations.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.170
That’s why I'd pegged her as the supporting type.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.080
I had no idea that, given a plot that played to her interests,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.010
she could be such a go-getter.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.340
Another early start tomorrow!

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.020
After chilling it overnight, we check to see if it's firmed up enough,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.860
then remove the cooling pipes.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.360
Next, we loosen the bolts holding on the lid,
Keep 'er coming, keep 'er coming...

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.080
and inject air between the mold and the pudding itself.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.530
Then...

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.240
Release the external lock!

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.090
Once the pudding's out of the mold, we shore up the outside

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.170
with softened gelatin and agar,

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.880
top it off with the separately-made caramel sauce,

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.930
lightly toast the surface, and...

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.290
We did it!

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.500
Oh man, it looks delicious!

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.280
You forget there's a bomb under there!

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.320
And with that, Kayano's giant, killer pudding was complete.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.000
C-Can I really eat this whole thing?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.730
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.040
I just wanted to use up those discarded eggs.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.280
It was all Kayano-chan's idea.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.560
Oh, Kayano-san!

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.960
Well, see ya, Korosensei.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.230
We've got an English class to get to.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.930
Don't let any of it go to waste, now!

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.930
I would never! Oh, it's a dream come true!

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.600
Here I go!

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.920
Kayano. We'll watch the detonation from the hallway.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.320
Oh. Uh-huh.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.490
Yum, yum, yum, yum!

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.080
Look at him go.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.010
It's only a matter of time before he reaches the bottom!

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.810
There's also a surveillance camera in there,

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.710
alongside the remote-controlled bomb.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.130
We detonate the bomb just as the pudding around it is eaten—

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.170
the moment the screen lightens slightly from pitch black.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:11.880
The pudding...

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.410
exploding...

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.550
Yum, yum, yum, yum!

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.730
Having the flavors change midway is sure to make it tastier.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.070
Hmm, I see. So I should use a scale model to test its strength.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.150
No! Another collapse!

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.210
Pudding...

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.580
No!

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.300
I poured my heart into that pudding! We can't just blow it up!

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.040
Hey, calm down, Kayano!

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.830
Don't get emotionally attached to a damn pudding!

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.760
No, we can't do it!
It was made to be blown to bits!

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.430
We need to keep it in the yard forever as a monument!

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:53.470
Kayano Kaede's Still Life with Pudding Kayano Kaede's

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.430
Still Life with Pudding Kayano Kaede's

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.720
Still Life with Pudding It'll spoil!

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.890
Danger Phew. Time for a break.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.690
I detected the faint scent of a foreign object amidst all the deliciousness.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.600
The bomb!

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.770
And the detonator's been detached!

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.030
I ate from caramel to pudding to dirt, Pudding Pudding

then tunneled through the ground and removed it.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.070
Was it you who set up the bomb, Takebayashi-kun?

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.040
Your calculations were spot on,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.830
but I picked up on the distinctive scent of plastic explosive.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.200
Next time, pay attention to any odor components too.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.000
Yes, sir.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.430
And since you all worked together to make this pudding,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.970
you should all join in on eating it!

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.300
I've set aside nice, clean portions for you.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.850
Foiled again.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.890
And it was such a good idea, too.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.120
However, eating eggs that are meant to be discarded

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.150
is, strictly speaking, a violation of economic rules.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.920
We'll consider that and the importance of food in our next civics class.
New Civics New Civics New Civics New Civics New Civics

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.110
Yes, sir.
New Civics New Civics New Civics New Civics

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.320
Tough luck, Kayano.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.720
Or do you feel better now?

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.410
I didn't think you could be so hardcore.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.030
It was fun, not to mention unexpected.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.720
Not even your closest friends get to see your true blade.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.220
I'll try again sometime.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.180
In this classroom, even a pudding fanatic can be a top-notch assassin.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.890
I've got plenty more wibbly-wobbly blades where that came from!

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.940

Assassination Classroom Second Season Kayano Kaede

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.500
After the break,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.340
Karasuma-sensei really started buckling down on training.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.010
Today's phys ed class consisted of parkour—

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.840
turned cops and robbers.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.550
The cops were our two monster teachers.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.970
If we catch them all, they get twice the homework!

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.020
Don't get carried away.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.110
Aw, why can't I play too?

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.070
It's not fair. You guys have all the fun.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.320
You stuck me with guard duty and everything.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.460
Of course. It would hardly be training with you on the chase.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.360
Even if it is Karasuma-sensei chasing us,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.380
this is one big mountainside!

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.920
Given the time limit, he'll only be able to tag...

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.680
...two or three of us, max.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.460
Yep.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.550
I heard that.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.010
Beyond the ridgeline, eighty meters away.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.480
You're all under arrest.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.560
Huh?
What?

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.520
Okajima-san, Hayami-san, Chiba-san, and Fuwa-san are out!

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.350
Seriously! He's actually making us do drills in jail!

Now, look, Okajima...

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.200
You didn't even realize you were tagged? What is this, some battle movie?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.290
Just be careful, okay? He might already be behind you.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.000
Sugaya! Sugayaaa!

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.220
Karasuma's on the hunt alone?

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.920
Perfect. I'll pull him in by his tagging hand and take him down.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.470
Then we'll go at it right here. I'll make a real bad cop out of him!

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.770
Bring it on, I say! Oh ye—

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.610
Sugaya-san and Bitch-sensei are out!

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.900
Yikes! We're dropping like flies!

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.000
It's like Mount Slaughter out here.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.580
Weren't they taken alive?

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.200
Oh, this is cops and robbers, right? Which means...

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.450
Right! If we tag 'em, they're free!

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.290
Sugino, you dummy.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.940
Like anyone's getting tagged without that supersonic octopus noticing.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.590
Prisoners, focus on your work! No slacking!
If we could do that, we would've killed him ages ago.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.170
You have a point.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.900
Sugino! Did you come to spring us?

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.590
Do something about Sensei!

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.680
What?

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.710
Just this once.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.270
Sugino! Now!

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.480

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.990
Hey! How did those captured robbers get out?

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.240
They're shrewder than I thought.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.790
Whoa! Those boobs are something else!

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.200
They lured you away?!

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.670
Do not let my next batch of prisoners escape!

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.340
Actually, Korosensei...

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:44.190
My little brother is really sick. He can't even leave his bed.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.300
When I messaged him about our game of cops and robbers,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.010
he replied, "You gotta win."

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.560
If he knew I'd been captured, the shock just might...

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.310
Go.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.200
This cop never saw any robber. Go.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.610

How are these criminals escaping from jail?

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.080
That's my line, you sloppy cop!

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.450
Time's up! Game's over!

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.200
It's over.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.920
Thank goodness.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.380
In the end,

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.840
our game of cops and robbers ended with us getting away.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.640
Korosensei ticked off Karasuma-sensei as he always does,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.850
but it was good training for us.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.100
Anyone could see our second term was off to a good start.

We're disappointed, to say the least.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.920
How could you do such a thing?

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.910
No, wait! I don't know anything about this!

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.350
So what's your alibi?

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.440
My alibi?

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.700
Where were you on the night of the incident,

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.270
and what were you doing?

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.920
What was I doing?

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.760
I was moving between ten thousand and three thousand meters in altitude,

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.830
shaking a bag of seasoned fries.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.280

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.060
C'mon, that's enough.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.860
Korosensei may be a slave to the desires of the flesh,

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.500
but all he's really done so far is...

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.890

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.100

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.110
How rude! I'm an innocent man!

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.650

Kataoka Megu Kayano Kaede Kanzaki Yukiko

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.900
Why am I the only one marked "Forever Flat"?!

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.800
And this here...

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:36.550
Kunugigaoka's F-Cups and Above Wait! I... That can't...

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.380
is a list of women in Kunugigaoka endowed with at least an F-cup!

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:45.120
Oh, right! I was getting ready for an after-school barbecue!

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.270
See? Don't these skewers look tast—

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.990
This isn't good.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.280
Unbelievable.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.620
Gross.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.290
Th-That's all for today... class...

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.630
See you... tomorrow...

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.900
Today must've been hell for him.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.720
He might never come back after all that.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.390
But did he really do it?

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.310
I mean, it's a serious crime.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.770
Compared to blowing up the Earth, it's downright adorable.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:36.860
Yeah, well... But if I were a Mach-20 underwear thief,

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.740
I sure wouldn't leave such shoddy evidence behind.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.660
A ball from the equipment shed.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.500
He'd have to know that if he did this, he'd be dead to us as a teacher.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:56.720
And for that teaching-obsessed monster, I'd think losing our trust with this nonsense

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:01.470
is right up there with getting assassinated in terms of things he wants to avoid.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.180
Yeah. I'd have to agree.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.760
But then... who could it have been?

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.740
An impostor.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.240
Fuwa-san?

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.150
That color, his laugh... Make no mistake.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.950
It's a fake Korosensei! The old hero-movie villain trope in action!

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:25.000
So the culprit is someone deeply familiar with Korosensei.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.120
Ritsu!

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.290
Look for clues with me!

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.000
Roger!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.080
Something along those lines, anyway.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.360
I don't know why they'd do something like this,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:42.970
but if this rumor runs our bountied buddy out of town, we'll lose everything.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.010
Let's beat the real criminal silly

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.600
and put that octopus in our debt.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.590
Yeah!

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.940
"Forever Flat"...

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.820
Elementary, my dear Watson! The legendary detective is on the scene!

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:04.080
All we're doing is using parkour to trespass.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.670
Hey, Fuwa, how do you know the culprit's gonna strike here next?

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.370
This is a training camp for a certain talent agency.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:19.550
A big-busted idol group has been here for two weeks practicing their latest dance routines.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.840
Yes, and based on the suspect's disposition,

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.100
there's a 99.78% probability this place is in his sights.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.250
And tomorrow's the last day of camp!

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.160
No way will our man let these top-notch trophies get away.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.820
I see.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.370
Korosensei!

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.350
Is he after the real thief too?

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.200
He looks like one himself in that getup.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.080
Watch! He's so mad at the actual culprit

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.160
that one look at the underwear has him all hot and bothered!

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.920
I can't see him as anything but the bad guy!

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.840
Hey, over there... Someone's here!

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.550
A big guy with a yellow head!

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.720
I knew it!

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.810
So someone else was behind this!

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.520
With the way he carries himself, he's no ordinary guy!

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.020
Uh-oh! He's getting away!

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.140
Gotcha!

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.610
So you disguised yourself as me

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.960
and did things I only wish I could have done!

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.570
I'll strip you naked and take care of you from stem to stern!

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.040
This might be even worse than being a bra thief.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.530
The reports got his laugh exactly right.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.950
Now show your face, you impostor!

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:39.090
I-Isn't that... Karasuma-sensei's subordinate?

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.050
You...

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.760
But why would—

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.520
I negotiated with the government to borrow one of Karasuma-sensei's men.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.910
He lured you right into this pen of anti-teacher fabric.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.420
Just like what your students did on that tropical island.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.320
Youngsters have such limber minds.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.280
First you confine the target, and then you strike.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.900
That voice...

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.730
Now, then, Korosensei.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.620
Let your final death match begin.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.670
Korosensei...

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.510
Compared to me, you are...

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.910
weak.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.370
The moon that floats in the night sky
yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:45.600
If you stretch out your hand, you can reach it
te wo nobaseba todoku no te wo nobaseba todoku no

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:52.000
I went to touch it: it was warm

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:56.210
sotto furete mita atatakakute And slowly drew me in

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.210
And slowly drew me in jinwari suikomareta
jinwari suikomareta

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:07.990
The multiplying footprints, the view from my window
fueteku ashiato mado kara miru keshiki mo

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:14.100
As I drifted along, expressionless
muhyoujou ni nagare nagara muhyoujou ni nagare nagara

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.530
They spilled out of my hands ryoute kara koborete yuku
ryoute kara koborete yuku

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:25.450
It was rocking, swaying... I never knew
yurayura yureteta shirazu ni ita

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:30.950
Until I touched it with my own hands
kono te de furete miru made kono te de furete miru made

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:36.330
I want to gather up and go through all of the things
kaketa tsuki no shita chirabatta mono

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:43.720
Scattered beneath the waning moon
