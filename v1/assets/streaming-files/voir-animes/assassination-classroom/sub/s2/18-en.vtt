00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.990
A-An attack from behind at point-blank range?

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.240
It came so suddenly... and out of nowhere!

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.570
There wasn't a soul there until just now!

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.460
I get it.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.340
So he was blending in with Karasuma-sensei?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.340
The only one to use Self-Defense Force camo.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.580
and he waited for his prey at the perfect sniping point!

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.640
Gotcha!

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.140
That's why I was so tense— because he always pulls stunts like that.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.780
Anyway, now it's one-on-one.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.910
Let's finish this, Nagisa-kun.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:02:22.990

18th Period Sugaya Sousuke Outcome Time

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.220
So now it's down to Nagisa and Karma.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.680
Pretty gutsy of Nagisa to hide behind Karasuma like that.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.060
The referee is the one with the least presence in the players' eyes.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.870
Nagisa-kun zeroed in on that, blended in with the referee—

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.940
and waited until the moment when he could score the most kills.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.950
He has the instincts of a natural-born killer!

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.440
And what about Karma-kun?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.450
If we compare them on the basis of regular school grades, he's got Nagisa beat on all counts.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.580
But he must have realized by now:

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.220
when they're facing off in this assassination classroom,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.670
Karma-kun's greatest foe is Nagisa-kun.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.160
He's moved already?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.230
Nagisa-kun! Put down the gun and come on out!

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.190
We'll settle it with these!

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.430
Nagisa, you dummy! Shoot him! He's walking straight at you, wide open!

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.780
I... don't think he'll shoot.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.610
Huh?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.820
That Karma-kun...

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.790
He sure plays dirty.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.830
If I ignore the challenge and shoot him with no provocation,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.140
the red team won't accept that we won fair and square.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.540
And he knows it, too.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.470
If I want everyone to be in agreement on saving Korosensei,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.870
I have no choice but to take him on in close combat—his specialty.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.220
Nagisa!

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.390
They're going mano a mano?! No way!

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.280
Nagisa wants Karma-kun, more than anyone else, to understand his desire to save Korosensei.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.110
Let's watch from closer in!

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.850
It's like... I still don't want to kill him,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.370
but when you face a strong opponent with equally strong determination of your own...

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.750
It's incredible. I can still feel the sense of accomplishment from killing Rinka.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.700
Will I feel like this after we kill Korosensei, too?

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.920
Here come the wavering opinions.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.990
Guess we change our tune once the camo stops working, eh?

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.150
Some of us showed strength we didn't expect,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.740
like you, Kayano, Mimura, and Kanzaki.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.640
Some of us went ballistic like we thought they would,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.690
some got all fired up to do better next time,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.490
and one irresponsible-lookin' type turned out to be crazy serious.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.660
Hush, you.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.660
The guy we thought was just a little runt turned out to be a genius assassin,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.580
and a guy we thought was a genius was secretly workin' hard all along.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.720
Whichever of 'em wins is fine by me.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.010
With all these different skill sets...

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.460
we just might be able to handle any challenge that comes our way.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.490
Ever since first year...

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.430
To put it simply, I looked up to Karma-kun.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.030
Hey, Sensei, what's this here?

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.450
Oh, Akabane!

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.320
Working on second-year material already?

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.080
He did what he wanted and was completely unafraid.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.300
And yet, he had the smarts and could do anything.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.050
Okay, that's all I was wondering about. I've got the rest.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.900
Hey, Akabane!

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.060
I'm feeling kinda thirsty, so I'm heading off early.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.730
"If only I could be like that..."

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.760
That's how I felt, in my ordinariness.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.430
Whoa, no way!

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.120
Nazzoni directed Sonic Ninja? How cool is that?

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.500
Ooh, and it opens today?

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.770
Let's go, Shiota-kun!

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.430
Uh, yeah!

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.600
So I was happy when he talked to me and we started to hang out.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.430
That was halfway through our first year.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.300
But we couldn't stay friends for long.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.380
You Karma? You got nerve, beatin' up a guy's pal like that!

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.590
Huh? Dunno what you're talking about. He's the one who messed with me.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.020
Bullshit! He told me that—

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.560
Can't hear you! What was that? Say it again!

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.980
Come on!

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.370
He could stand where he did because he had the strength to win in studying and fighting alike.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.240
His was a stage I could never hope to take.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.610
He must have gotten bored, sharing mine with me.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.350
By the time he had gotten suspended,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.540
we'd gone back to being plain old classmates.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.620
He was a harmless little mouse,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.950
making him one of the few people a combative guy like me didn't have to be careful around.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.710
But looking back, I put that distance between us

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.370
because there was already a part of him back then that made me uneasy.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.970
Huh? Where'd he go?

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.270
Nagisa-kun!

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.030
I could let my guard down around him...

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.090
I'm right here, Karma-kun. Didn't you see me?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.850
...but something kept me on alert.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.580
Something that felt like it could blindside me one day.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.110
He was so honest and good, unlike me,
Sorry 'bout that, Nagisa! You're just so small!

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.130
Ugh.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.580
that my anxiety had to be all in my head.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.560
Still, he had this mysterious... something

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.180
that I wanted to drag out of him and crush.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.170
Something that scared me.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.940
But it wouldn't have done anything to beat him in a fight or in test scores.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.150
That indescribable part of him was something else altogether.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.230
It was hard to handle, and before I knew it, we had drifted apart.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:41.120
Now for the first time, in our third year, we're finally up on the same stage: assassination!

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.850
And we need to win to get our own points across!

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.350
You're going down!

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.970

Assassination Classroom Final Season Shiota Nagisa

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.340
Nagisa...

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.000
A desire to win, to conquer—

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.320
the great competitive spirit afforded the young!

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.280
You must forget all about me!

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.530
Your own answer is there before your eyes!

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.500
Kill!

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.580
Save!

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.530
Even that well-timed tackle didn't bring him down?

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.980
There is a huge power difference between them.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.610
Yes. One knife touch is all it takes to decide the winner,

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.940
but Karma-kun's physical abilities make getting to that point no mean feat.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.910
Now, cast your attention toward Nagisa-kun.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.880
He has one more knife in reserve.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.820
In preparation for a clap stunner?

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.280
But Karma-kun will have noticed, of course.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.090
It won't be easy to use it against him.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.160
Two assassins, their weapons and approaches worlds apart...

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.300
How will they settle this?

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.300
Stay tuned!

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.610
If I take these blows poorly, I'll be inked for sure.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:47.870
Now!

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.040
Tch!

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.840
Nice! He knocked his knife away!

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.780
Now's my chance!

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.970
They both lost their weapons?

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.840
But Nagisa has another one!

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.980
I won't let you draw it.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.230
The second you try, I'll hit you.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.690
I'll knock you out and take my sweet time dealing the coup de grace!

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.490
That all you got?

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.550
Karma-kun's taking Nagisa-kun's attacks on purpose.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.840
His hits have to be doing something. He's been training for a whole year!

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.030
Karma-kun is a combat assassin who values the process.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.320
Tactics, strategies, and winning techniques all play a part.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.310
Only after such a battle comes his assassination.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.600
Nagisa-kun, on the other hand, is a pure assassin,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.010
singlemindedly searching for the one strike that will lead to victory.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.470
And Karma-kun takes it all, blow after blow.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:07.990
If he wins like that, even Nagisa-kun will have to accept defeat.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.340
An axe kick?!

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.490
Bring that to a fight and the other guy doesn't stand a chance!

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.610
I'll probably never find another place like this again,

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.460
where your feelings can be right out in the open.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.820
But I will kill him...

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.080
because I believe it's the right thing to do.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.460
What, now?!

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.090
That's the last of his strength!

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.590
He bit his tongue to keep himself on his feet!

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.010
Just you try killing me, Nagisa-kun...

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.350
with that talent I never had!

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.890
I'll break it all right over my knee...

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.340
and win!

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.080
All that bloodlust, condensed into that knife!

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.940
If I can just dodge that, I win!

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:25.960
Huh?

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.890
N-No bloodlust?!

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.620
An arm-triangle choke?!

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.360
That arm pressing on his carotid will make him pass out!

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.590
It's an even more perfect position than his earlier triangle choke!

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.510
I will make you accept my plan!

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.050
How is he pinning Karma down so awesomely?!

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.020
Nagisa-kun gave up his prime assassination technique as a decoy

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.480
and chose to finish the battle using martial arts.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.980
All so he could end things using Karma-kun's specialty, not his.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:09.200
Now he's trying to beat me on terms I'll accept.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.160
Uh-oh.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.870
At this rate...

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.080
I'm gonna lose!

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.900
A knife!

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.300
That close?

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.800
Me, fight?

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.260
I think I'd be too scared to ever do that.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.580
I mean, I guess if my life depended on it...

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.530
Uncle. I give.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.300
I lost, Nagisa.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.070
Hey! Listen!

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.200
That's enough!

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.640
With the red team's surrender,

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.660
victory goes to blue—the "don't kill" team!

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.040
Yes!

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.040
Aw... Well, you won, Nagisa.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.010
I won? I... beat Karma-kun?

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.240
Like anyone would approve of me using a knife

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.980
to beat a barehanded mouse who'd shown as much guts as you did.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.460
I couldn't stab you, and I couldn't get away.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.450
I was backed into a corner, and all I could do was surrender.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.180
You beat me with martial arts, not with a knife.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.370
Never would've thought that'd end up being the best way to kill me.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.310
I got slaughtered.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.870
You want to save Korosensei? Just tell me what to do.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.100
Really? Are you sure?

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.220
Don't give me that dumb look with that beat-up face of yours.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.570
You look like a plague rat.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:56.560
Th-Those insults sure do roll right off your tongue, Karma-kun.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.740
Look...

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.560
Why don't we drop the honorifics already?

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.190
I don't much feel like sticking with them after that fight.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.930
What, now?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.740
It feels weird to change this late in the game.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.200
You don't have to, but I will. Okay, Nagisa?

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.620
All right,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.840
Karma.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.160
When a big decision looms, people reveal their true feelings—

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.550
and in some cases, fight in earnest.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.960
But take a look at these students.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.980
It's precisely because they all fought in earnest

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.030
that they can understand what they normally don't show one another.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.000
Your attacks were awfully weak, Karma.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.230
Ow ow ow!
You know I was pulling my punches!

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:53.640
Sometimes the heat of conflict is the best place to forge the bonds of friendship.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.160
Even discord and conflict are part of education to you, huh?

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.120
I'm sure you all have your own thoughts on this.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.590
I have no objection to the course this class has decided through battle.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.940
You may search for a way to save him, but one condition remains:

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.300
you have until the end of the month.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.260
Though you may have called a moratorium on your own assassination,

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:23.680
there are plenty of other efforts underway to take this guy down.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:26.200
If someone's going to kill him, it can't be anyone else.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.740
I want it to be you.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:33.740
So promise me that no matter how January turns out,

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.740
February and beyond will be spent giving your all to assassination.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.350
Whether you save him or kill him, give it everything you have.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:44.900
Yes, sir!

00:17:45.870 --> 00:19:15.920


00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:58.610
komorebi ga yasashiku sashikomu ookina mado no naka
As the dappled sunlight shone gently through the window

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:08.870
kimi to deatta ano hi wo tooku ni kanjita
The day I met you felt so far away

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:20.110
sukoshi zutsu narabeta omoi ga boku wo atatameru
The memories I've arranged little by little keep me warm

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:33.130
chiisana heya tsunagu kokoro sotto oshiete kureta
A small room, hearts connecting: you taught me gently

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:45.920
kono kisetsu ga mukae ni kitara kimi no sugata mou sagasu koto mo
Once this season comes for me, I won't be able

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:51.160
dekinaku nacchaun da ne dekinaku nacchaun da ne
To seek you out anymore, will I?

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.800
zutto wasurezu ni iru yo zutto wasurezu ni iru yo
But I'll hold your memory in my heart

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.780
mata kimi ni aeru hi made mata kimi ni aeru hi made
Until the day I can see you again

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.090
Let's step back for a second.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:23.980
Are the world's leaders really only thinking about killing Korosensei?

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.290
I don't think so.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.060
After all, their primary goal has always been to save Earth.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.320
Along with their research into killing him,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.070
they must be doing research into alternate methods too.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.510
Why don't we check up on that?

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:44.490
Indeed, the world's top science facilities have formed project teams focused on saving the planet.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.830
But naturally, that info is all top-secret.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.120
It will be difficult for you to find out what they're studying.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.870
I've gained access to the project database!

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:53.460
What?!

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.940
I can get into just about any PC that's online now.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.920
I've learned so much this year!

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.330
Ritsu...

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:08.040
Wow! We can see what labs around the world are researching and on what schedule!

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:13.940
But there are no online traces of the data we're looking for.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.660
I guess the top-secret stuff is only passed around in person.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.360
Is anyone doing research on how to save Korosensei, then?

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.990
There! An American research team!

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:27.260
"Preventing destructive antimatter chain reactions

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:32.460
that accompany division of tentacle cells approaching senescence"!

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:38.380
"Final samples to be returned from the ISS on 1/25"?

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.340
The ISS? Is that...

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.050
Th-The International Space Station?!

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.810
That's where they're doing their research?

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.020
Oh! It could be!

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.050
Lots of research has to be done in zero gravity or in a vacuum.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:58.080
And if there's any chance an experiment could result in a huge explosion,

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.540
there'd be less damage in outer space!

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.040
If only we could see that data...

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.740
Unfortunately, you're just one tiny, distant outpost of assassins.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.270
Depending on the circumstances, it may never be available.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.750
Karasuma-sensei?

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.090
No matter what happens,

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.480
we won't give up on this assassination.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.260
But we don't want to be wishy-washy about it, either.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.120
If there's a way to save him, we will.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.940
And if not, we've decided to handle that, too.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:33.890
Right, Nagisa?

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.850
Right. After all, it's our class's critical objective.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.960
So I want to know for sure which it is, right now—

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.520
so we can stick with our assassination till we graduate.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.370
Karasuma-sensei, Irina-sensei,

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:51.620
could you please step out for a moment?

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.710
Further discussion along these lines could potentially cause liability issues for you two.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.480
Now, then... Here's what you're trying to do:

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:09.140
sneak a peek at the data before it reaches America on its way back from space.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:13.310
But how... About that!

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:19.730
Photo: Proof-of-Concept Craft Under Development
Did you know they're about to send this baby up to the ISS?

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.690
A manned rocket?

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.900
Yes. A proof-of-concept craft being developed here in Japan.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.660
It's supposed to carry an experimental dummy, but...

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.990
what if there were real people in it instead?

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.330
You don't mean...

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:39.330
Ha! Our teacher's crazy in the head, all right.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:44.500
Yes! An out-of-season research project for our assassination classroom:

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.620
hijack the space station and steal their experiment data!

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.260
N-No way.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.390
Yes, way! All the way!
