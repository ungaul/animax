WEBVTT

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.270
The second-term finals culminated in our crushing victory.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.900
But then our disapproving principal showed up

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.040
and, hiding behind a notice of Korosensei's dismissal,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.720
challenged our teacher to a one-sided game of chance.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.780
Now, Korosensei...

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.700
become the foundation on which I will lay my philosophy.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.720
Okay. Opened, solved, and closed!

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.980
I more or less remember which questions are on which page in this particular series of workbooks.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.440
Math was the only challenge.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.410
I'd lent that one out to a student for so long that I'd forgotten.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.320
Oh!

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.460
You just happened to have memorized the exact books I decided to bring?

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.280
Heavens, no!

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.370
I've memorized all of Japan's workbooks.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.120
"No moving out of the blast radius until you've solved the problem"?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.240
A rule like that is no trouble for a passionate educator.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.220
Here I thought you understood me,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.020
but it seems your students' defeat has unnerved you.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.100
You've dug your own grave with this simplistic assassination.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.400
One book left. It's your turn.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.440
How does it feel, having your own death staring you in the face?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.020
That grand kaleidoscope glimpsed in one's final moments...

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.320
What could be flashing through that perfect mind of yours?

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.950
Sensei!

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.410
Asano-sensei!

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.690
Two monsters took up teaching at the same school:

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.430
one to repent of his strength,

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.240
and one to repent of his weakness.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.160
Nice try, Ikeda-kun, but you couldn't get me today either.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.620
A deal's a deal. Be a good boy and study.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.580
Dang! You're a real beast, Asano-sensei!

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.790
Hey, Asano-sensei,

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.280
why'd you start a cram school in this abandoned schoolhouse up on this mountain, anyway?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.000
Didn't you graduate from a top school overseas with loads of qualifications?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.980
Feels like a waste of talent and money to me.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.140
And a waste of energy making it up here.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.480
Nothing is for naught in this world of ours, Nagai-kun.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.920
This mountain path is perfect for training up your physical strength.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.400
Urk...

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.150
And the money? This place is in the red, isn't it?

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.430
Don't worry, Mori-san. My stocks will make up the deficit.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.580
With my skill, they'll make money even with minimal attention.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.490
This month, I'm about five hundred thousand in the black.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.040
The perfect superhuman!

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.550
You may be perfect, but you're crazy into teaching.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.460
Just how do you intend to educate us, anyway?

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.470
By simply having you grow into good students.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.970
But the bar for "good" is different for everyone.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.490
Ikeda-kun's high spirits are good.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.300
Mori-san's savvy is also good.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.360
And Nagai-kun's diligence is good too.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.080
But in order to make each of your good points even better,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.940
as your teacher, I need to know all of the "good" qualities out there.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.430
I'm only perfect because I have to be!

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.850
The private cram school was off to a good start.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.430
Those three were the first students of my inaugural term.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.470
In the quiet of the mountain, I could cultivate their strengths to my heart's content.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.700
The ideal education of my dreams...

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.130
Ow!

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.390
Hey, I gave you a heads-up! Get outta the way next time, slowpoke!

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.650
We're barely out of class, and you're misbehaving already.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.500
I'm gonna be a basketball player!

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.200
How could anyone just study all the time?

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.790
A fine dream, Ikeda-kun!

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.150
How about a little...

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.190
one-on-one?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.900
What do you say?

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.870
Like I could win against a perfect superhuman!

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.830
Well, I do have abilities you haven't yet been given...

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.810
just like not everyone has the strengths you do.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.970
Sorry, Nagai.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.570
It's okay.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.390
Everyone has faults.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.770
I would tend to those faults,

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.820
cultivating people who could let their strengths shine to the fullest in society one day.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.500
I put everything I had into my lesson plans.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.310
A year flew by, and the students had come along well.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.740
What's this?

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.810
A kunugi oak-leaf tie clip!

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.100
We pooled our money together to buy it.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.250
It's probably peanuts compared to what you make on your stocks, though.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.520
Yep. I made another seven million yesterday.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.340
He could've kept that to himself.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.700
But... this is lovely.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.480
We all got into our first-choice junior highs.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.780
And we couldn't have done it without you, Asano-sensei.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.710
Yeah!

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.970
When I grow up, I'll be a real good guy, and I'll come see you!

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.460
This is already enough. You've grown into such good students.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.940
When they saw my résumé and track record,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.420
more parents started entrusting their children to me.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.790
Three years later, the cram school was booming.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.600
Oh! What's it been, three years?

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.670
Good to hear from you, Ikeda-kun.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.190
Long time no see, Sensei! Sounds like you're at the top of your game!

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.630
More or less. What's up?

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.200
Oh, nothing really. Just wondering how you were doing.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.100
Same as always.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.240
What about you? Not running wild and causing trouble, I hope.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.420
Course not! I'm a solid hunk of caring, just like you taught me to be!

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.350
You sound busy. I'll call back later.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.670
How 'bout we get a nice dinner with your investment money, eh? Bye!

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.790
I have an errand in his neck of the woods next week.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.420
Maybe I'll stop by.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.970
A suicide, they said.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.440
There was a nasty older kid on his sports team, I heard.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.260
Beat him up, of course, but took a fair amount of money off him too.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.480
He'd had a reputation for being such a sweet boy since junior high.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.650
Don't you think, you know...

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.480
he should have maybe stood up for himself a little?!

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.670
What on Earth had I been teaching?

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.620
Cultivating good students?

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.860
How can a student dying in three years be considered "good"?!

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.390
If I don't build strong students... this will all have been for nothing.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.300
But then what is "strong," anyway?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.290
If I'm going to teach it,

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.420
I'll need to get to know all of it.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.160
Things moved quickly from there.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.890
I learned all there was about many forms of strength.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.430
I sweet-talked the men who killed my student,

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.390
leading them down the road of gambling addiction and poverty.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.560
I honed my brainwashing techniques on them.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.050
After that, I opened another school.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.790
The campus that symbolized my lack of strength

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.420
would serve as an object lesson to the weak.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.820
Strong. I needed only to make them strong.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.600
Strong students who could survive,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.170
even if it meant sacrificing others when push came to shove.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.270
And to that end...

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.220
I would need more money. More staff.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.780
If it could serve my education, I would use it.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.260
All to produce even one more of the strong.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:02.690
And now, both the weak and the strong have left my side,

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.100
and all I have before me is death.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.090
Well, Principal Asano? Will you open the final book?

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:17.970
No matter how superhuman you may be, opening a grenade-filled workbook will not end well.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.310
Hey, this was your challenge.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.300
If you don't wanna die, just throw in the towel gracefully!

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.560
Yikes!

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.280
And besides, we don't even care if you fire Korosensei!

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.900
It'll be sad to leave this place behind,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.860
but we'll go where Korosensei goes.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.990
Even if it means leaving home or holing up in some mountain,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.790
we'll keep our assassination classroom going till March.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:50.060
This year's E Class has been a constant thorn in the side of my education.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.070
How many times now have I seen such bald-faced opposition?

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.240
Korosensei,

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.340
under my educational philosophy,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.270
you could very well destroy the Earth and it wouldn't matter.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.500
Once the Earth is gone, the end will come to everyone equally.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.660
My students won't be the only ones suffering defeat.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.660
That is one of my philosophy's ideals.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.660
Have you forgotten my ability to molt?

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.740
Your once-a-month trick, eh?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.220
Why didn't you use it on yourself?

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.250
I was saving it for you.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:52.140
If I won, there was no doubt you'd have opted to blow yourself up.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.190
How can you be so certain what I would do?

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.400
That's how much we have in common.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.380
We're both as stubborn as we are education-obsessed,

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.460
aiming for perfection in teaching even if it means giving up our own lives.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.540
I talked to your old cram-school students during the exams—

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.050
about their impressions of you as a teacher and what happened back then.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:22.500
The educational ideals I pursue are the same as yours were a dozen years back.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:28.840
Where I've been lucky, compared to you, is with the E Class.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.140
Because there are a fair number of students,

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.520
and because they all share the same circumstances,

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.220
they can come together to withstand challenges

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.820
and can ask each other for advice without holding things in.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:46.930
And, Principal Asano, this E Class exists because of none other than you.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:53.960
You've unconsciously been carrying on the ideal education you came up with all that time ago.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.170
I'm the only one this knife can kill—

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.460
my instruction is not in robbing humans of their lives.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.500
You and I share the same ideals:

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.320
an education that does not kill but lets live.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.890
Let's keep putting that ideal education of ours into practice.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.880
Playing outside is fine, but it's important to attend class as well, Ikeda-kun.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.630
Hmph! Bein' a kid's all about livin' life, not studyin'!

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.930
Hmm. Well, how about this?

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.810
I'll give you one chance per day to land a hit on me, whenever you like.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.540
If you succeed, I'll let you skip class that day.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.160
Seriously? Promise?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.000
Yep.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.040
You gotta see it through to the end, Asano-sensei!

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.040
No runnin' off halfway!

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.170
My philosophy is always correct.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.090
I've turned out a great number of strong students these past dozen years.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.350
But now you've acknowledged my system as well,

00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:00.060
so I will permit this E Class to remain.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.070
Still can't simply admit defeat, I see.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.780
Oh, and...

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.740
May I come by to kill you every now and then?

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.490
Of course.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.250
That knife suits a worthy rival well.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.590
Your perfect facade is crumbling.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.610
I can tell by your face you've lost again, Father.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.000
Did you need something, Asano-kun?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.930
Just thought I'd come console my loser father by asking compensation for this injury.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.260
You can throw in a grade-A prime Kobe steak while you're at it.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.150
Aha...

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.480
Take me to court on domestic violence charges if you like.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.120
You'll never win against me, no matter how much you grow.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.240
What makes you say that?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.580
Because I'll keep growing, too. As an educator...

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.290
and as a parent.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.520
By the way, sir... Where's our reward for the exams?

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:05.630
Oh, right!

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.090
I promised to tell you my crucial weakness, didn't I?

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.300
The truth is, I have surprisingly little strength.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.400
I'm too specialized for speed.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.160
When I'm at a standstill, even a single human can hold back one of my tentacles.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.290
So if we all locked down all of your tentacles...

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.990
...we could stop you from moving?

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.120
If we could do that, the whole assassination'd be a cakewalk!

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.940
You only told us 'cause you knew it was impossible, octopus!

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.830
Hmm. No luck, eh?

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.420
The trick is to pretend you're grabbing a slime eel.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.840
A drama festival?!

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.470
Now? When we're right about to take high-school entrance exams?

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.840
I complained to Asano about it at the student council meeting,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.880
but he shot back:

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.320
It's training to memorize lines and stage directions in a short period of time.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.940
All part of Kunugigaoka Junior High's educational policies.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.860
Besides, it's you guys. You'll figure it out.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.950
Nice.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.940
Nagisa-kun, Nagisa-kun!

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.120
You play the lead!

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.870
Not another dodgy suggestion...

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.300
What about you, Kayano-san?

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.040
The kids were really into your play at the preschool.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.560
Huh? But I—

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.540
Like that'll work with a junior-high audience!

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.930
They ain't gonna see themselves in some pint-sized player!

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.250
Hah!

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.250
I'd like to work on props.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.340
Okay, so for our main staff,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.050
I guess we should have Mimura as the director

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.940
and Hazama as the writer.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.270
As for our leads... I want to play the lead.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.550
Yeah, right! You, a state secret?!

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.020
You're a grown-up, so act like one and stay out of it!

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.800
B-But I've always wanted to be the lead in a play!

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.110
And I want to stand on the same stage with you all!

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.320
Sure. I've got just the thing.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.970
A play that'll satisfy the wishes of both assassins and target!

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.290
Okay, here's our chance!

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.950
Let's whip those main-campus mooks into a storm of excitement!

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.960
Let's see.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.680
Next up is the E Class.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.720
Let's just sneer at 'em while we eat.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.180
A peach.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.660
According to radiography,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.580
there's a baby growing inside.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.830
The old man's eyes lit up

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.370
as he instantly realized the value of this peach.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.560
How marvelous! A rarity, indeed!

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.660
The media'll be all over this one!

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.070
If I put it on display, I'll be rich for the rest of my life!

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.620
Eh?

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.420
Divorce papers.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.710
The old woman had been wavering over whether to leave him.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.930
But the old man's disregard for children's rights, along with his cruel words—

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.680
"I" and "my," not "we" and "our"—

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.490
made up her mind at last.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.930
The furrow that had formed between them over thirty years of marriage

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.100
was like the river where she did the washing.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.600
The stifling air between them

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.620
was like the carbon dioxide from burning mountain firewood.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.120
This peach is all mine.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.190
I'm the head of the household!

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.630
I decide how to divide our shared property!

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.520
Lawyers.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.560
We represent your wife.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.400
Any further communication must go through us.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.430
About the peach... As your marriage had failed long ago,

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.270
the cut-off date for determining marital assets is long past.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.270
Add in reparations for emotional distress,

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.490
and one peach isn't going to cut it.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.320
Thirty years of verbal and physical abuse directed at the old lady.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.070
He'd stopped earning a living a while back.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.530
She had plenty of evidence.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.580
The old man had no hope of winning in court.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.430
The local men he'd hired to intimidate her

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.960
were hauled off by the police.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.800
The old lady brought the peach to her new home.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.720
She felt bright and cheerful, like her life had been freshly laundered.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.340
It was the first day of her new life with the peach.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.800
One, two, one, two... hooray!

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.530
Here we see a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.520
It seems they're being trained to attack people.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.030
The wild animals ate their feed and innocently followed orders.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.450
The only evil one was the old man, tainted by his lust for wealth.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.670
Perhaps the demon island Onigashima is inside us after all.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.720
The peach child will be born soon.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.740
Will he, too, host a demon one day?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.690
Th—

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:14.760
That's heavy!

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.360
It totally ruined my appetite!

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.860
Funny how words can leave marks.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.700
I'm the lead! The lead!

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.760
That blasted E Class!

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:36.130
My school has wound up right in this creature's tentacles.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:42.590
But the E Class won't end quite so happily ever after.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.830
With what I've heard from the Ministry of Defense

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.410
and from my own experience here...

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.270
I'm the only one who can predict what will happen next.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.980
Can you still be a teacher...

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.380
in the wake of the biggest storm ever?

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.300
Surprise!

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.040
Cast-Aside Kunudon!

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.030
With the school infighting over, having served his purpose,

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.700
Kunudon was sent to the E Class.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.600
Get away from me, losers!

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.040
I ain't like the rest o' you!

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.030
Three cheers for unemployment!

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.930
Goodbye, Kunudon!
