00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.010
Surprise!

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.480
Teach us, Kunudon!

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.780
Hi, everybody! Kunudon here!

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.150
Autumn means good food, cramming sessions...

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.530
and school festivals!

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.230
And school festivals are no joke here at the prestigious Kunugigaoka Academy!

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.680
Return-on-investment ratio!

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.740
Getting results here will look great to potential employers while job hunting!

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.770
That's why everyone's so into it!

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.440
The employment Ice Age!

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.600
Some students display stunning business acumen that'd put any full-fledged member of society to shame!

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.680
Nouveau riche! Yay!

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.010
Our chain will gladly lend its support.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.780
The Kunugigaoka School Festival is famous nationwide.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.980
Using our products would be fantastic publicity for us.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.900
Asano-kun, we consider your customer draw and future promise well worth the investment.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.650
Thank you very much.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.120
Wh-What junior-high student signs on with a sponsor?!

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.810
No blind spots. We'll blow that E Class away—as we should.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.640
The main campus sure is getting hyped about this year's festival.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.350
They probably figure we'll be up to something, even if we can't win.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.420
I hear that Asano actually signed an endorsement contract with a restaurant.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.820
I wouldn't put it past him.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.300
We'll just have to go for the win.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.820
This match will likely hinge on a compilation of everything but assassination and studying.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.160
I really don't want to lose to the A Class...

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.040
but what can we do?

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.980
Asano-kun's right. The key is to make people feel they're getting a good deal.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.700
If you can use a tight budget to make something of greater value,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.820
the customers will come.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.790
Well, yeah, but... The answers are all around you!

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.750
The value of the E Class here

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.770
lies in this, this, this, and this!

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.360
These ingredients are like you:

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.110
hidden in the mountains where no one notices their power!

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.040
So we attack our customers with hidden weapons.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.610
Makes for a pretty assassin-y restaurant!

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.080
Now, sell these blades like you're going in for the kill!

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.620
Come on by! Acorn noodles made with real acorns!

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.750
A new taste sensation made with the mountain's natural goodness!

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.100
Even upperclassmen like you—adults who recognize value—

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.220
will never have tasted deliciousness like this!

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.320
Oh, yeah? Is it really that good?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.810
Of course! Taste the just-picked freshness!

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.120
Huh. Nice place ya got here.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.830
Hey!

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.260
It's the high-school guys from our class trip!

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.380
What are you doing here?!

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.130
Oh? Come to abduct another girl, have you?

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.120
Like hell we are.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.170
Wouldn't want your freak of a teacher to show up again.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.930
But we don't need to get physical to wreck your day.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.890
I could... start shoutin' that your food tastes like crap, say?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.140
Or put a few choice words online?

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.100
Well? Bring it out already.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.530
Our signature dish: acorn noodles.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.880
Whoa, this looks great! Hey, Ryuuki-kun, can I order a Mont Blanc too?

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.490
Yeah! I wanna try the smoked fish!

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.870
Hey, cool it! Your stupid's showin'!

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.710
Pfft. Leave it to a junior-high kid to come up with this.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.020
One bite, and I'm gonna puke.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.820
S-So good!

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.520
We wanted to get lots of dramatic reaction shots out of them...

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.780
but those cooking anime have a monopoly on that.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.890
Fuwa-san...

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.140
Not bad, right? I spent a solid week on research.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.600
The noodles are acorn, thickened with grated yam.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.840
Mountain foods are really strongly flavored,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.160
so I went with a rich dipping broth.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.020
It was hard work!

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.390
These pork-bone and soy-sauce acorn noodles

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.820
are the result of my search for the ultimate balance.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.040
True... I ain't ever tasted anything like it.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.700
For Muramatsu, it's downright miraculous.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.600
So much for your mediocre flavor being a selling point.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.000
Shut up, Itona! Get to work!

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.690
Let's try something else! C'mon!

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.320
What's this "slender Caesar" mushroom?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.140
Never had that before!

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.810
Hey, you jokers! Say it tastes like crap!

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.470
Oh? Does it?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.180
Oh, dear... Did you not like my students' cooking?

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.080
What a babe!

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.100
No, no, no, no, no! It's crazy good!

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.360
Oh? Then how about this persimmon-loquat gelatin?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.960
It's just as soft as my skin.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.860
Yes, ma'am!

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.820
And if you were to eat one of everything,

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.200
it would make me sooo happy.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.530
B-But I don't have the cash...

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.410
There's one right by the train station.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.500
An A... T... M.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.740
Time to make a withdrawal!

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.740
Okay! I'll be waiting!

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.750
They're poised to drain guys dry.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.490
With Yada at the bottom drawing in customers

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.430
and Bitch-sensei at the top...

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.590
That's one mean master-disciple duo.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.760
We have Sugaya-kun's posters,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.280
Okajima-kun's food photos,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.900
Hazama-san's menu descriptions,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.480
and Mimura-kun's special-edition website—

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.480
everything we need to pique our customers' interest.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.040
It's only day one. The battle's just getting started.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.380
According to my recon,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.400
it looks like the A Class is better at getting customers interested.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.870
This is our school festival debut!

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.890
Asano-senpai!

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.580
Glad you could come. I hope you enjoy yourself.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.880
We've got all kinds of events running at one-hour intervals.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.620
My idol friends and comedian buddies are performing for free.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.580
The 500-yen entrance fee gets you free food and drink.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.960
When the event on one stage is over,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.740
the next event starts right away on the other side.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.360
People will keep coming back, paying the entrance fee each time,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.510
and by the time they've satisfied their curiosity,

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.380
their stomachs will be full to bursting.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.140
I doubt they'll feel like going to the E Class's café.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:58.790
Okay, we're up. You get ready while I knock out a few songs.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.840
Is there anything he can't do?

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.800
Right?

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.140
Honestly, he can do so much it's kind of disgusting.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.060
But even a guy like that can fail.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.180
Can't have that—not against the E Class or anyone else.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.560
No matter how crafty our leader is, I'm sick of seeing him lose.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.920
We're the chosen ones too, you know.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.320
Learning an instrument between study sessions is no big deal.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.560
Shall we give him some backup?

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.280
Yeah!

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.700
Hey, Nagisa! You here?

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.680
I'll have this.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.260
You got it.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.660
We made it!

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.240
Sakura-chan!

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.500
And Matsukata-san with the rest of the kids!

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.600
Hey, so you kept in touch, Nagisa?

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.090
Yeah, I help her study sometimes.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.590
When your exclusive tutor asks you to come,

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.300
you pretty much have to, y'know?

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.930
Way to go, Nagisa.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.130
It's a predator!

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.360
That's a big boost to our customer count, at least!

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:00.950
Ladykiller!

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.420
How are you, Princess?

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.020
Sorry we don't have deeper pockets.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.920
Oh, now this is superb!

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.270
Something this tasty is gonna sell for sure.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.720
It's been a struggle.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.960
We can make good stuff, but it's hard to let folks know about it.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.030
Hmm.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.450
Aw, but I wouldn't worry.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.680
You guys have this mysterious power, y'know?

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.080
Right. If you've been nice to others, word will get out one way or another.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.280
Thanks again!

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.540
I am confident about what we've accomplished so far.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.430
But it'd be great to spread the word to as many people as we can.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.470
Listen, Nagisa, I heard why you let your hair grow long.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.960
I'm sorry. You didn't want to do it...

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.650
Did my teasing hurt you?

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.690
Oh, not at all!

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.640
I can handle a little ribbing from you and Karma-kun.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.330
Oh, okay. I'll try to lay off the teasing, anyway.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.900
Hey!

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.960
Th-That flighty voice...

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.420
Nagisa-chan! I came to hang out!

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.240
Y-Yuuji-kun?!

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.130
Yuuji?

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.590
Oh, from the tropical island—

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.680
that guy who mistakenly fell for Nagisa!

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.690
H-How'd you know I went to school here?

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.570
I looked up the island's guest records.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.690
When I checked the school's website, I saw your festival was underway!

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.650
O-Oh, okay... Ah, hey! Whoa! Nakamura-san!

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.160
One last time! One last time!

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.200
You just said you'd lay off!

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.300
He's rich, isn't he?

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.180
We've got to raise our per-customer sales any way we can.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.210
Go get 'em, Nagisa-chan!

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.080
The fate of the class rests on your hostess skills!

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.880
Whoa!

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.300
Man, I'm so glad I came during the festival!

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.100
I can't believe I got you all to myself!

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.740
Plus, your suggestion to eat in private where no one can see us...

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.560
You're getting my hopes up!

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.130
I just don't want any customers I know to see us.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.490
Now I've got cue cards?

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.950
I-I want you to try allll my favorites!

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.120
Sure, sure! I'll order the whole menu if that's what you want!

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.050
Kid's rich, all right!

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.590
He's a good eater too, so make us some money, Nagisa-chan!

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.420
Oh, I quit smoking those sketchy herbs.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.800
After all, you were worried about me!

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.910
Oh, I see.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.010
Here you are!

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.010
Ooh, this looks good too! Lemme take a picture.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.870
I feel bad about fooling Yuuji...

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.940
but I've got to keep up the charade so he won't sniff out all my secrets.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.520
Karma-kun, that is not my line of work!

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.980
Hey!

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.690
Karasuma-san! Brought you something!

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.500
I'm liking all the rich colors on this mountain!

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.700
I heard the Reaper did you in.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.480
It was touch-and-go there for a while.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.860
But I'm young enough to recover quickly.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.830
Never mind that, just hide your gun!

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.630
Who's that? He has a gun!

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.280
M-Maybe we should call the police—

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.050
Wh-Whoa! N-No, that guy is, uh...

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.570
Y-Yoshioka-san from the local hunting club.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.220
"Yoshioka-san"?! But he's totally a foreigner!

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.320
H-He's naturalized. A big anime fan. You know how it is.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.510
Oh, really?

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.050
Well, enough about Yoshioka-san...

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.280
Nagisa-chan, be honest.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.950
What do you think of m—

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.780
My god!

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.600
Lovro... The octopus invited me.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.500
I see. I'm just glad you're still alive too.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.870
Your pupil's been worried. Go see her.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:57.580
I will.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.440
Wh-What's with the scary old dude?

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.090
He's no ordinary guy!

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:07.350
M-Mild Yagyuu. He's a big name in the Asakusa theater scene.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.510
He's a comedian?!

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.710
Th-That conversation?

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.470
They were discussing a routine.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.480
His pupil quit comedy, see, and became a teacher here, and...

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.730
Hmm...

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.690
Gun-tastic! You wouldn't think kids put together this flavor!

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.900
Yeah! It tastes so good I'd gladly eat even a poisoned bowl!

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.370
F-Fellow comedians! From Asakusa!

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.790
And the guy eating the wasabi Mont Blanc is doing a reaction gag he learned directly from Mild Yagyuu!

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.660
We just seem to fall in with that kind of crowd.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.040
Hey, Nagisa-chan...

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.960
You're lying, aren't you?

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.430
My old man's a big-name talent.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.580
I've seen the faces of countless people who've cozied up to him ever since I was little.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.390
I can tell when people put up a front. When they wear a fake smile.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.360
The girl I met at that island hotel?

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.080
She wouldn't smile like that.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.940
Wow. Good eye.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.930
Nothing good about it.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.910
Just an unwanted talent I got from my skeevy environment.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.540
You're right. I was lying to you.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.080
I've looked like this ever since I was a little boy. l can't help it.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.340
And I always hated it.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.090
Wait... "boy"?

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:31.550
But lately I've learned that if it can help others, even an unwanted talent can give you confidence.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.560
So I don't hate it that much now.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.850
I'm sorry. I'm a guy.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.580
Another lie?

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.410
No, really.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.200
Another one?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.570
No, really.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.110
Show him, and he'll believe you!

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.150
Show him what?!

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.370
Does this look like the face of someone who's lying?

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.560
No way...

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.380
Examined from another angle,

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.310
your faults and weaknesses can be weapons.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.280
What I've learned in this classroom is how to achieve just that.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.540
It's how we put together this café,

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:12.060
and it's the connection that brought all these people here today.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.180
It's really exciting, not to mention fun.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.060
Oh, b-but since I tricked you, I'll give you your money back!

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.820
Nah. I just... feel like such a dummy.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.580
I'm out.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.740
Huh? He left already?

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.300
I was going to wring him out for a cosplay photo shoot.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.870
Just how much were you trying to make off me?!

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.170
Yuuji-kun... That was wrong of me.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.570
Well, our first day went all right.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.290
The sales reports are up.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.390
At this rate, we won't get anywhere near the A Class.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.770
Hurry, or we'll miss the morning broadcast!

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.500
Huh? A TV crew?

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.920
Covering what?

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.150
The only thing up ahead is the E Class.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.660
What the hell?!

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.700
You guys! Everybody's talking about us on social media!

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.600
I dug around a little to find where it began.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.290
And what I found...

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:29.250
was Norita Yuuji—the most influential food blogger on the 'net!

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.530
Thanks to having grown up on a diet of high-class food,

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.800
his tastebuds are, annoyingly enough, the real deal.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.220
His reviews as a wandering gourmet for whom money is no object are super reliable!

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.780
Yuuji-kun...

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.210
I came across a crazy-delicious café at the Kunugigaoka School Festival.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.920
My next post will cover the menu in depth, but for now,

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.080
my whole outlook on life has changed.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.760
They used all kinds of self-sufficient ingredients,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.700
turning a poor location to their advantage.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.710
"Your faults and weaknesses can be weapons."

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:07.400
When I heard my friend who works there say that,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.360
I thought about how guilty I felt to be so spoiled,

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.440
hiding in the shadow of my big-shot father.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.290
I was such a dummy.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.220
The allowance I've been pampered with—that's my weapon.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.010
And I want to use it to help people,

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.860
so I'll just go for it and post my recommendations.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:30.020
First, the life-changing mountaintop café.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.990
You've only got one day left to taste it!

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.040
Welcome!

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.030
We all ran ourselves ragged after that.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.440
With every new order, we foraged, cooked, served,

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.660
and sold.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.580
Our friends and acquaintances kept coming, and coming,

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.740
and coming!

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.970
Uh-oh! We're about to run out of acorn noodles!

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.410
We've had more customers than we thought we would.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.310
But the A Class will have made more money.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.860
The "tastes of the mountain" side menu is selling well too.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.230
Let's stick it out with those in the time we have left!

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.900
If we go a little further into the mountain,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.860
we can build up our reserves a bit.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.150
Hmm...

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.030
No. Let's end it here.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.210
But then we can't win.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.460
That's all right.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.980
Any more foraging, and we'll destroy the mountain's ecosystem.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.250
Yeah...

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.710
The actions of all creatures contribute to our deeper interconnection.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:41.250
Did you sense all the connections with which fate has blessed you?

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.630
Those who've taught you, those who've helped you,

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.990
those you've caused trouble for, those who've caused trouble for you,

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:52.100
and those you've fought as rivals, only to better one another.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.860
So today turned out to be another lesson after all.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.780
Damn. I really wanted to win, too.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.580
I'm sorry! We're all sold out—

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.210
Oh, are you? You were very popular.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.620
Mom...

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.790
Here you go: our last crimson-glory-vine juice. I'm sure you'll like it.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.810
Thanks.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:26.310
Your class is really something. I see why you want to stay.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.260
Yeah.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.720
Nagisa, what happened here the other night...

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.880
When I saw you walk away, I realized...

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.320
that my son was his own person.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.330
And that "graduating" from me was no bluff.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.480
I knew that somewhere along the way, you'd found the strength to do all that.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.240
But, Nagisa...

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.990
At least stay with me till you come of age.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.340
Then you can do whatever you like.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.760
I'm your one and only mother, after all.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.860
Let me worry about you for a little longer.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:12.880
Okay!

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.220
All of the connections we encounter in this world

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.860
serve as teachers who nurture us.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.030
How about making today the day you were born?

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.270
The connections you gave me...

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.410
Am I doing a good job passing them along?

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.800
Hey.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.560
Nagisa-kun's mother apologized.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.480
I understand she tried to set a fire?

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.500
Yes. But that's water under the bridge.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.880
And she whispered something to me as she left...

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.970
She said she'd keep my wig a secret? What's the meaning of this?

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.640
That A Class is amazing!

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.540
They beat the high-schoolers to come out on top!

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.110
That's Asano-kun for you.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.180
But the E Class stands out too.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.250
They came in third even after closing shop halfway through day two!

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.070
How would it have turned out if they'd stayed till the end?

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.640
Did you go?

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.240
Well, it was on TV and everything... I got all curious, y'know?

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.150
Here I thought the E Class was this hellish place.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.580
But being all self-sufficient out in nature like that?

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.710
They might actually have it pretty good!
