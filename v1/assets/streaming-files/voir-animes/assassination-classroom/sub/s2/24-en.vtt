WEBVTT

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.830
We'd always been kept safe.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.020
By a teacher as overprotective as he was tough—

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.860
a teacher who had learned life's lessons ahead of us.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.030


00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.990
24th Period Akabane Karma Graduation Time

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.170
Kayano... Thank goodness you're all right.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.880
Nagisachoo!

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.170
Brrr...

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.570
Hey! What happened to my clothes?!

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.470
Wh-What?

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.520
How pitiable.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.280
What is?!

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.850
Aw, c'mon.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.600
Korosensei even fixed up your hair for you.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.770
Thanks... but I wish he'd fixed up my clothes first.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.310
Y'know, Korosensei's so generous with his care and all

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.540
that you might've come out of that a little better-endowed than before.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.700
Is that so, Korosensei?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.080
Phew... I'm beat.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.050
Having collapsed, Korosensei seemed unusually satisfied...

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.870
and unusually frail.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.220
Class?

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.220
What kind of an assassin would let a dying target escape?

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.140
Don't you see?

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.520
It's killing time.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.360
All good things...

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.820
must come to an end.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.580
That's what a classroom's all about.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.430
The swelling light of the laser

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.880
told us eloquently, cruelly, that it was right on schedule.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.950
We had no time to hesitate.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.420
March 12th March 12th

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.230
Everyone...

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.120
We have to decide this ourselves.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.060
We could choose to stay out of this and leave it up to fate.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.660
Show of hands: Who doesn't want to kill Korosensei?

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.480
Okay, hands down.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.700
Who wants to kill him?

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.990
They were always with us:

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.860
our guns, our knives...

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.940
and our teacher.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.160
That was our answer.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.820
We were killers. Our target was our teacher.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.650
We were all painfully aware of what we had to do to our mentor

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.160
for us to graduate with our bond still intact.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.540


00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.870
Korosensei's Weak Point #33: Can be captured if everyone holds him down

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.540
Korosensei's Weak Point #33: Can be captured if everyone holds him down

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.340
You can't move when we do this, right, Korosensei?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.080
Exactly, Nakamura-san.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.580
But it might not work with such a weak grip.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.640
Maybe it was ultimately to kill him,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.180
but we tried not to think too much about that.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.990
This was our teacher who'd praised us, scolded us, and nurtured us all year,

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.910
and we all renewed our grip on his tentacles, holding on more firmly.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.130
Your heart is under your tie, right?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.350
Who's going to do it?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.310
Everyone, please...

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.400
Please... let me.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.530
We got no complaints.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.170
You're the head of this class, Nagisa.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.980
Sensei...

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.500
Nagisa-kun, you can stab down through my tie.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.950
The very day I received this tie, I managed to put a hole in it.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.690
I left it like that.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.820
This, too, is an important connection.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.590
Ah, but first, I have to say my goodbyes to these teachers.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.780
Irina-sensei, are you sure you don't want to join in?

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.350
This is your chance at that bounty.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.530
I've gotten enough already.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.060
So many bonds, so much experience... from you and the children both.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.020
This assassination... is the bond between you and those kids.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.530
And...

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.090
Karasuma-sensei.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.000
You were the one who truly made these students what they are today.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.410
Please continue to offer them your guidance.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.120
I will.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.000
You may have caused me no end of trouble,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.330
but this is one year I'll never forget as long as I live.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.430
Farewell, Korosensei.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.270
Very good.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.460
Now then, class, it's about time.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.780
Even twenty-four hours wouldn't be enough for me to say my goodbyes to each of you in turn.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.870
We can't talk long, so instead,

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.700
I'll take attendance one last time.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.910
Please look me in the eye and answer in a clear voice.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.570
Once you've all responded, you can kill me.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.660
N-Nobody left early, did they?!

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.980
If someone didn't respond now, of all times, I'd kill myself!

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.190
Just do it already!

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.020
Korosensei's Weak Point #36

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.360

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:34.740
Gratitude, parting regrets— I put all of my emotions into my blade.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:40.740
And so beautiful You understood us better

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.690
As if to pour in my very soul,

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:47.160
as if to thank him with all my being, Than anyone else

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.990
I offered my knife.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:53.510
Surely what you taught us

00:16:53.510 --> 00:17:04.380
Will keep guiding us on our way The cherry blossoms

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:10.190
Flutter to the ground

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.470
At the end, it felt like he was saying,

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.330
"Congratulations on your graduation."

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:24.720
Our time Ceaselessly brimming with emotion

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:31.900
We knew it wouldn't last, and yet we remained

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:43.200
Looking at the sky, unable to move Parting time

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:50.360
Thank you, we loved you

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:59.930
We feel you cheering at our backs

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:07.970
In this song of journey

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:28.790
Our time Our school, growing distant now

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:35.960
Precious friends, teacher of life

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:47.190
We found them all there Parting time

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:54.070
And so we graduate

00:18:54.360 --> 00:19:04.010
To serve as our thanks, we give to you

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:11.730
This song of journey

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.660
Soon the clock would tick over to midnight,

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.300
and it would be graduation day at Kunugigaoka Junior High.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.660
We'd graduated from our assassination classroom just ahead of that.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:10.120
Afterward, when we returned to the classroom in search of some trace of Korosensei,

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:15.160
we found our diplomas, yearbooks...

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.180
and one copy of "Korosensei's Rules to Live By" for each of us.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.680
Apparently the laser hit us at some point,

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.720
but it mattered so little to us then that we never even noticed.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.850
Karasuma-sensei met the on-site inspection squad that showed up later

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.920
and dealt with them outside.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.440
He said, "The students on this campus fall within my jurisdiction,"

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.020
and let our classroom be ours alone.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:51.780
The incredibly thick guidebooks that Korosensei had made

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.940
started in a considerate, easy-to-read manga format,

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.160
and then...

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.060
I think the workbooks at the end there are good enough to sell!

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.340
Add some short stories for an English vocab guide worth reading!

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.160
Tch!

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.880
You could draw a spin-off manga starring me—still alive!

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.140
I could even be the big baddie!

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.180
Honestly, we got a little fed up with his overly detailed advice.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:30.330
Before we knew it, we'd all forgotten our tears and were sleeping soundly.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:37.500
komorebi ga yasashiku sashikomu ookina mado no naka
As the dappled sunlight shone gently through the window

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.560
When we woke in the morning and looked outside,

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:47.760
kimi to deatta ano hi wo tooku ni kanjita
The day I met you felt so far away

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.790
the early-blooming cherry blossoms were nodding,

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.980
small and strong.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:59.000
sukoshi zutsu narabeta omoide wa boku wo atatameru
The memories I've arranged little by little keep me warm

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:12.020
chiisana heya tsunagu kokoro sotto oshiete kureta
A small room, hearts connecting: you taught me gently

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:24.810
kono kisetsu ga mukae ni kitara kimi no sugata mou sagasu koto mo
Once this season comes for me, I won't be able

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:30.050
dekinaku nacchaun da ne dekinaku nacchaun da ne
To seek you out anymore, will I?

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:35.690
zutto wasurezu ni iru yo zutto wasurezu ni iru yo
But I'll hold your memory in my heart

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:41.670
mata kimi ni aeru hi made mata kimi ni aeru hi made
Until the day I can see you again

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:53.850
Congratulations on your graduation!
