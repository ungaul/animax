00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.640
Now then, Korosensei.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.830
Let your final death match begin.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.890
Korosensei...

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.920
Compared to me, you are...

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.450
weak.

Itona!

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.730
First, we make drastic changes to the field of battle.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.740
Then we attack.
Ow ow ow!

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.620
Confining him first makes it far easier to strike.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.350
I've taken a page from your tactical handbook, you see.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.160
Sh-Shiro! So you were behind all this?

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.480
Exactly.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.070
Once that creature fears he will lose his students' trust,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.940
he'll act rashly out of panic.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.700
Even if things seem a little off, he'll dive headlong into danger,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.370
the fool.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.480
Dammit! That's our kill!

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.750
Why do you always play so dirty?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.540
It's called "being an adult."

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.300
See what Itona has on his tentacles there?

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.960
Beads with sharp edges made of anti-teacher material.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.940
Every time they touch,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.090
the creature's exposed tentacles will take more and more damage.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.760
That should be more than enough to finish him off.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.270
I win, Brother.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.730
I'm killing you

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.690
for one and only one reason:

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.570
to prove

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.320
that I am the strongest!

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.210
Yes, very well done, Itona-kun!

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.880
If it were still the first term, you might very well have killed me.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.340
But your attack pattern is a simple one.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.510
No matter how fast you are, no matter how strong,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.510
no matter how many schemes your guardian thinks up,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.120
no matter how easily I freak out,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.310
by our third fight, I can see and adapt to your patterns.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.850
No way... It can't be...

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.190
Itona-kun...

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.180
I study too, you know.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.490
How could I teach anyone if I didn't also grow and learn day by day?

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.160
Now, let's get rid of this troublesome cloth cage.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.650
Experiencing my Absolute Defense Form over summer vacation

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.390
taught me yet another skill:

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.380
compressing not my whole body but a portion of my tentacles to release a burst of energy.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.260
What?!

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.970
Remember this, Itona-kun.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.920
I say assassination is education.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.870
The teacher of the assassination classroom

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.100
gets stronger with every lesson!

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.550
Why... can't I... win?

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.640
I'm... supposed to be... stronger now.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.380
So there you have it, Shiro-san.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.070
Leave him in the E Class's capable hands and go quietly.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.970
Oh, and...

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.800
spread the real truth that I am not an underwear thief!

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.940
And I'm actually a B-cup! A B-cup!

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.210
lt hurts... Itona-kun!

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.110
My head's... killing me!

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.570
My brain's about to burst!

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.120
Due to the shock of his repeated defeats, his tentacles are starting to gnaw away at his mind.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.660
Hang in there, Itona-kun!

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.540
This might just be all that he can take.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.630
Why, he couldn't even pull off my otherwise flawless scheme.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.200
Wh-What is he saying?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.090
Itona,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.860
if this is all you're capable of, the Organization will withdraw their funding.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.070
It's not that I don't feel for you,

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.520
but we have to cut our losses at some point,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.020
if only to get the next model up and running.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.920
This is goodbye, Itona.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.660
You're on your own now.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.360
Wait!

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.570
What kind of guardian are you?

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.220
Quit playing school, you monster.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.040
All you can do is break things— break everything, even.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.850
I will not suffer your very existence.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.250
I wish only for your death, no matter the sacrifice.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.680
Say, are you sure your dear students will be safe, given the situation?

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.810
Look out!

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.820
Itona-kun...

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.520
Korosensei!

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.820
As you might imagine, I'm pooped. Time for a little rest.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.880
With tentacle cells grafted to your human body,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.280
you must undergo adaptive treatment almost daily

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.780
or be tormented by hellish rejection symptoms.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.360
Now that I've halted your maintenance,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.870
the excruciating pain will cause your nerves to wear away.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.940
The average person dies of madness in three days.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.940
Here's where the first incident occurred.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:13.020
A string of attacks on cell phone shops throughout Kunugigaoka

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.160
have the police discussing a potential link to terrorism.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.440
This has got to be... It's him, all right.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.600
But why cell phone shops?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.310
What should we do, Sensei?

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.680
As his teacher, it's my responsibility to stop him.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.630
I have to find him and keep him safe.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.430
I've got a good handle on Shiro's personality.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.060
To him, everyone's a pawn to be used and discarded—

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.930
and you never quite know what a guy like that will do next.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.350
I think it'd be wiser to leave him to his own devices.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.980
Even so, I'm his teacher.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.460
And when I accepted my position, I vowed

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.160
not to let any of you slip through my tentacles, no matter what.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.180
There are no shortcuts, Itona.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.730
Only those who study daily and work with integrity

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.010
will grow stronger.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.560
That liar.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.870
Forget lip service. Enough beating around the bush.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.620
I'm sick of the losers' phony strength. I want to win.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.230
I want the strength to seize victory.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.800
The human part of you is showing at last, Itona-kun.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.300
Brother... "Korosensei," if you please.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.080
After all, I'm your teacher.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.260
Don't be goin' nuclear on us now, Itona.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.850
You put us through a lotta crap, but we'll let it slide.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.520
Just come with us quietly.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.650
Shut up!

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.730
We'll settle this through battle. This time... I'll win.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.400
Of course we can fight it out.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.000
But since we're both state secrets, let's find a vacant lot somewhere first.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.240
Afterward, we'll all study ways to kill me

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.260
over a nice little barbecue together.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.540
He's a persistent one, that octopus.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.630
Once he takes charge, he'll go to the depths of Hell to teach you.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.590
Of course! Put a student in front of me,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.310
and I can't help but want to teach them. It's only instinct.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.400
Wh-What is this?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.440
I can't see!

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.190
Is this... anti-teacher powder?!

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.860
Setting Itona adrift was all part of the plan, Korosensei.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.870
I was so distracted by Itona-kun’s bloodlust that I didn't notice!

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.960
Come now, ltona—your final duty.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.120
Itona-kun!

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.540
You'll come after him, won't you? Being his teacher and all.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.640
Korosensei...

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.290
Is everyone all right?

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.800
More or less.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.480
Then I'll go rescue Itona-kun!

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.880
Protecting us reduced his evasion response time.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.240
No!

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.620
Damn that Shiro! He made us his pawns, all right!

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.960

Assassination Classroom Second Season Akabane Karma

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.300
Itona-kun!

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.630
Pressure rays, to slow me down!

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.680
Not that I'm surprised. But you really are a fool, Korosensei.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.140
I'm after Itona.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:16.240
That's right. You grow weak when the target is anyone but you.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.780
Now, will you run away?

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.700
I am his teacher!

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.200
I...

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.160
I'm powerless.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.950
That's why even my partner's abandoned me.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.700
Good eyes.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.250
In them, I see a dogged fixation on winning—

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.910
crucial for making the most of the powerful cells I've created.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.400
Why don't we do a little addition, you and me?

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.980
Let me plot your path to success.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:56.310
Your tenacity plus my technology equals the power to seize victory.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.280
With power, you can be stronger than anyone else in this world.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.160
I was dead set on power,

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.010
so I could withstand the searing pain of those mysterious cells.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.120
I was dead set on winning,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.440
so I could throw myself into conflict, again and again.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.370
But I didn't get what I sought.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.130
And the one I was meant to kill is protecting me!

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.050
I... I can't lose to those nobodies...

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:25.550
What the—

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.930
This is anti-octopus material, right?

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.260
Damn you for making us do the dirty work!

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.800
Terasaka! Get the light in the tree!

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.610
On it!

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.450
You brats...

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.780
But... why would you...

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.620
Don't take this the wrong way.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.280
We're just pissed at Shiro.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.790
If Korosensei hadn't run off, we would've left you high and dry.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.860
Hayami said "Don't take this the wrong way!"

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.010
The classic tsundere line. Marvelous.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.510
You sure you want to be looking this way, Shiro?

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.470
If you stop shooting, the netting'll come right off at the base.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.440
You made it!

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.740
The netting is melting his tentacles!

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.150
We'll get you out of there!

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.190
Step down, Shiro-san.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.190
We'll take Itona-kun.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.910
You always plan so carefully,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.870
but even the best-laid plans go astray once my students get involved.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.260
The sooner you realize the obvious, the better.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.170
A class consisting of a monster swarmed by tiny flies?!

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.460
How infinitely irritating.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.760
But I will concede that my plan needs some radical revisions.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.980
Keep the boy.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.240
He'll only live a few more days as it is.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.730
Play nice together, now.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.650
Studying, integrity... Lies, all of it.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.520
In the end, all that matters is whether I have the power to overwhelm my opponent.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.120
As long as Itona-kun keeps his pathological attachment to power and winning,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.210
his tentacle cells will adhere too tight for us to remove.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.790
Can't we cut them off somehow?

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.180
Not until we get rid of his fixation.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.920
That's why we have to learn more about how he got this way.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.430
Yeah, but...

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.510
I kinda doubt he'll be forthcoming about his life story.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.660
Actually, about that...

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.060
I'd been wondering something.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.520
Why was Itona-kun going after cell phone shops?

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.900
So I had Ritsu look up some stuff about him,

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.570
and it turns out the president of this company had a son named Horibe Itona.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.280
This little factory supplied smartphone parts to buyers around the world.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.540
But two years ago it went under, burdened with debt.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.160
The president and his wife vanished, leaving their son behind.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:04.920
We started to see the reason behind Itona's lust for power and victory.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.760
Pfft, is that all? That made him into a delinquent?

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.970
Everybody's worried about somethin'.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.470
Big problems, little ones...

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.080
We'll take him in 'n look after him.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.650
If he dies, well, that's that.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.820
Look, Itona.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:36.300
Even a tiny factory like ours can compete with the big names if we work with integrity.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.080
What a load of crap.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.610
But why? You know all our techniques! If you leave us...

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:52.640
Studying and integrity are meaningless in the face of superior, overwhelming power.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.520
I'm sorry, Itona. Go live with your uncle.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.400
You're awake. Finally.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.940
We refashioned the anti-tentacle netting into a bandana.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.320
Just for peace of mind.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.780
But you can't pop out those tentacles anymore, can you?

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.700

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.610
Why ramen?

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.340
He's got to be hungry, right?

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.210
He'll feel better after he eats.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.270
Well? Isn't our ramen totally gross?

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.180
I keep telling my old man, but he won't change the recipe.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.220
It is gross. And stale.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.390
The soup uses MSG to cover up the corners cut on chicken bones.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.140
The main topping is a smugly placed naruto cake.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.650
Basically, last century called, and it wants its ramen back.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.860
This punk knows his stuff!

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.330
If a franchise opened nearby, this place would be toast.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.820
My father may have studied, but he still suffered a tragic loss.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.190
Let's hit my place next.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:04.280
Our modern tech'll put this fossilized ramen to shame!

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.210
Why, you—

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.840
Whaddya think, Itona? Let the speed blow your cares away!

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.340
An unlicensed junior-high kid? You sure about this?

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.300
It is on Yoshida's family property.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.400
Feeling good and hyped?

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.120
It's not bad.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.100
Awright! Now for my high-speed braking turn!

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.050
You idiot! Go help him!

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.400
What if the shock makes him go nuts again?!

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.650
Aw, a little bump like that won't hurt him!

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.240
They're just making it up as they go along.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.470
Yeah.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.440
I mean, they're basically idiots. What do you want?

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.500
But at least Hazama-san's got some brains.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.460
You want to get back at Shiro, don't you?

Seven volumes. 2,500 pages.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.760
Read this, and feed the darkness within.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.000
He gives up on his revenge toward the end,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.240
so don't bother reading that far.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.560
What a friggin' pain!

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.080
Hazama, your stuff is always way too involved and way too dark!

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.400
So? You've got to cherish the darkness in your heart!

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.560
Don't you have an easier way to cheer him up?

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.530
This guy probably ain't the brightest—

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.720
Uh-oh. He's getting all twitchy.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.410
Probably pissed that Terasaka called him dumb.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:21.370
No...

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.330
It's the tentacles. He's going to flip out on us again!

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.910
I'm not like you, fine with just doing whatever.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.130
I'll do it now! I'll kill him, and victory will be mine!

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.300
Terasaka!

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.830
Hey, Itona. I used to think like you.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:42.140
I couldn't wait to kill that octopus.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.520
But you can't do it. Not right away.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.980
Get rid of that impossible vision of yours. It's easier that way.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.110
Shut up!

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.570
That's the second time... and you're weaker now. Easier to grab.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.860
Still hurts enough to make me hurl, though.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.160
But that just reminds me of Muramatsu's ramen.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.750
Hey!

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:11.500
That octopus told him to study business.

One day, when he takes over,

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.970
his new flavors and management skills will get that joint jumpin'.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:25.430
Yoshida was given the same recommendation— in case it came in handy someday.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.080
C'mon, Itona.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.160
Don't let a couple losses throw you off course!

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.150
All you gotta do is win someday.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.860
And when it comes to killin' that octopus... it don't hafta be now.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.190
We can fail a hundred times over.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:45.080
Just kill him once before March... and we win.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.140
You can use the prize money to buy back your dad's factory.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.040
Then your folks could come back.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.600
I can't stand this.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.230
What do I do until I come up with my next vision of victory?

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.050
Huh?

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.230
You just fool around, like you did with us today!

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.510
That's what we're here for!

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.990
Look at that idiot.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.560
Who else could say that with a straight face?

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.190
Although...

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.520
Sometimes a few words from an idiot is all you need to chill things out.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.590
So I was being... hasty?

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.450
Yeah.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.910
I think you were.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.620
That tint of attachment is gone from your eyes, Itona-kun.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.870
We can remove those painful tentacle cells now.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.880
In losing one great power, you'll gain many friends.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.590
You'll join in trying to kill me, won't you?

Awful, now that I've lost my power.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.370
But I don't feel any weaker.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.580
In the end, I will kill you, Korosensei.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.210
And so the problem child, Horibe Itona, finally joined our class.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.010
Hey, Muramatsu. I'm broke.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.270
Shout me some ramen. I'll try not to barf it back up.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.970
And naturally, he's in Terasaka's group.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:40.440
The moon that floats in the night sky
yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.670
If you stretch out your hand, you can reach it
te wo nobaseba todoku no te wo nobaseba todoku no

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:52.070
I went to touch it: it was warm

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:56.280
sotto furete mita atatakakute And slowly drew me in

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:56.280
And slowly drew me in jinwari suikomareta
jinwari suikomareta

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:08.060
The multiplying footprints, the view from my window
fueteku ashiato mado kara miru keshiki mo

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:14.170
As I drifted along, expressionless
muhyoujou ni nagare nagara muhyoujou ni nagare nagara

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:18.600
They spilled out of my hands ryoute kara koborete yuku
ryoute kara koborete yuku

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:25.520
It was rocking, swaying... I never knew
yurayura yureteta shirazu ni ita

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.020
Until I touched it with my own hands
kono te de furete miru made kono te de furete miru made

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.400
I want to gather up and go through all of the things
kaketa tsuki no shita chirabatta mono

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:43.790
Scattered beneath the waning moon
hiroiatsumete tashikametai sono subete wo
