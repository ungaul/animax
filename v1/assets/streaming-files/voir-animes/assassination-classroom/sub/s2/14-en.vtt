00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.850
Yesterday's drama festival sure was fun, huh?

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.000
Sugino got really into his performance.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.780
Who would've thought he could put on such an evil face?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.980
I got really worked up about co-starring with Kanzaki.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.820
But I bet my character totally put her off instead.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.070
That's not true, Sugino-kun.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.210
I thought it was really cool that you could act.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.170
Seriously?! Maybe I'll quit baseball and become an actor!

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.680
Pitchers need to be able to act, too.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.340
I'm happy to see my students discover unexpected talents.

Oh, no...

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.360
Everything fell out and made a huge mess, huh?

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.200
Yeah, my hand slipped while I was cleaning.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.970
These are the beads we used for the river in the play.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.630
We borrowed them from a prop company.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.880
It's fine. Let's pick them up together.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.420
Thanks!

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.640
I didn't want to get in the way of everyone making assassination plans.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.010
I see. So this is why you stepped out.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.590
I'll help too.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.560
If that's all right with you!

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.480
His back's wide open.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.800
But if we could get him under these conditions,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.260
we wouldn't have had to work so hard this past year.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.450
Something smells fishy.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.740
Oh, during the school festival, we smoked fish here.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.380
We had a lot of different school events, huh?

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.380
Yeah. But once we clean this up, they'll all be over.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.850
It really brings back memories.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.710
Like when Korosensei first came to the E Class.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.440
Back then, you kids were complete amateurs, huh?

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.560
I failed right off the bat.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.720
And Sugino couldn't do it, either.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.310
After that, Karma-kun joined us.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.850
I didn't know much about him, so I had you tell me all the details, right, Nagisa?

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.110
I got kinda antsy when Itona-kun came along.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.410
I thought he was going to beat us to it.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.950
I see Okajima-kun's left another hidden treasure!

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.160
I got to do lots of different things in this classroom, too.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.370
It's fun, but a little depressing.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.920
I'm a terrible swimmer.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.750
Once I put my mind to something, I just keep on rolling.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.370
Not even your closest friends get to see your true blade.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.620
I'll keep trying to kill you,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.790
with my wibbly-wobbly blades.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.710
I have more than you'd think.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.980
You didn't realize, did you?

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.820
Not in all this time.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.010
A pitfall?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.820
I love you, Korosensei.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.680
Now, please die.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.340
Kayano...?

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.580
In all the time I spent watching,

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.440
I saw many different assassins try and fail.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.320
The most effective tactic, out of all they used...

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.860
was a simple pitfall!

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.850
A pool of anti-teacher material!

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.120
I have to... get above ground... quickly!

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.120
I'm good, aren't I?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.300
I spent a year studying your tentacles' movement patterns from the best seat in the house!

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.010
One more attack!

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.180
Oh, no!

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.640
Korosensei!

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.660
What in the world was that just now?

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.280
Kayano-san?

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.300
What's with those tentacles?

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.770
Aw, man.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.930
I attacked with all I had, too.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.970
Can't believe I still underestimated him enough to let him get away.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.930
Kayano-san, what in the world...?

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.400
Sorry. Kayano Kaede isn't my real name.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.950
I'm Yukimura Aguri's younger sister.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.610
You understand now, don't you?

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.700
Murderer.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.000
Yukimura...

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.790
Kayano's face, after she'd dropped her facade...

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.690
The look of cruelty on it made her seem like someone else entirely.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.690
Well, no use crying over spilled milk.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.030
I have to move on.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.490
I'll try to kill you again tomorrow, Korosensei.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.420
I'll let you know where beforehand.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.890
Now that I've fought you tentacle-to-tentacle, I know for sure.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.420
I can definitely kill you as I am right now.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.610
Unthinkable.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.990
If she grew those tentacles without any maintenance,

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.910
she would have been under constant, hellish pain.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.620
There's no way she could have borne it without it showing on her face.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.560
Not only that, but she's Yukimura Aguri's little sister?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.130
Wasn't that our old homeroom teacher?

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.720
I thought I'd seen Kayano before somewhere.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.100
I remembered after seeing her with her hair down and that harsh expression.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.600
Do you remember Mase Haruna?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.060
The young acting prodigy who could easily take on any role.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.760
It's been a while since she began her hiatus,

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.710
and her hair and personality are completely different, so I didn't notice.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.020
Which is the real her?

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.970
When I first entered the classroom, I was surprised.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.710
There was someone completely unexpected in there.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.310
Yukimura Aguri's younger sister— real name: Yukimura Akari.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.760
She had infiltrated that classroom under an alias.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.630
When I realized who she was and investigated her private life,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.690
I confirmed she harbored tentacles of her own.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.710
She was able to grasp how to use those tentacles in a short amount of time,

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.260
so her intellect must be quite impressive,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.980
but her tenacity is even more miraculous.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.030
She endured the maddening pain from the tentacles without even breaking a sweat

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.670
and kept smiling for a whole year— a display of her mental fortitude.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.980
She put on different faces for different occasions

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.720
and prevented the others from noticing her murderous intent—a testament to her acting prowess.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.870
Her talent for assassination is head and shoulders above everyone else in the E Class.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.900

Assassination Classroom Second Season Kayano Kaede

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.900
I was just heading out to meet her.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.210
We had a lot of catching up to do.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.120
I was on an extended leave of absence from acting, as per my agency's wishes.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.100
People had stopped noticing me on the streets.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.470
This is a lot easier than it used to be.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.530
Maybe I should try just getting a regular job.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.020
Sis...

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.160
With my small frame, I was able to crawl in there before the adults could.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.010
And the sight that met my eyes was...

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.140
Sis...

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.360
Sis! Sis!

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.020
Sis! Come on, Sis!

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.010
To whom it may concern, I will withdraw for now,
but I am willing to take over as homeroom teacher
Kunugigaoka Junior High Class 3-E.
I will visit at a later date to negotiate.
Signed, a super-destructive being.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.510
Next to her, I found vials of liquid.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.810
I discovered later that they contained tentacle cells.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.600
I can't explain why I took one with me.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.150
But if there was a way to go up against that monster, the likes of which I'd never seen,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.820
it had to be in those vials. I understood that instinctively.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.760
Human Tentacle Weapon Prototype.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.300
Specially tailored for human implantation.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:31.000
Provides great power, but at the cost of hellish pain if maintenance is neglected.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.290
I don't care.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.210
It was the same as when I decided to become an actor.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.520
Once I put my mind to something, I just keep on rolling.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.700
This is the first time anyone's ever just passed our transfer exam out of the blue.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.190
Let's see... Kayano Kaede-san.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.060
Thank you very much!

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.460
A forged certificate of residence,

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.710
and the name of a minor character that was cut from a made-for-TV movie I was once in.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.530
I'll play the part. Perfectly.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.850
By the way, at this school, there's a class for students with behavioral problems...

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.360
Right?

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.320
If things proceeded according to that note,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.010
the monster that murdered my sister and ran away

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.820
would definitely come to Kunugigaoka's Class 3-E.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.790
Akari, you're so lucky you're cute.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.810
I'm jealous that you got those genes and I didn't.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.770
I'm jealous of you too, Sis.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.810
The only thing we have in common is our black hair, huh?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.560
I decided to change my hair color, too.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:45.690
I didn't know why that monster wanted to take over Sis's class.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.060
But as her little sister, there was only one thing I could do.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.160
In order to prevent my thirst for revenge from being exposed,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.920
I had to play the part perfectly.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.730
Oh, you must be... Yup, I transferred here today.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.510
Your hair sure is long.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:15.020
Oh, I want to cut it short, but I can't. It's kind of a long story.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.540
Whether I stood out or not, I'd be watched.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.710
That's why I had to play around with the casting.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.040
To create a main character who stood out more than me

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.320
and devote myself to being a side character.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.490
Look, now it's just like mine!

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.580
I'm Kayano Kaede. Nice to meet you!

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.100
The tentacles asked me what I wanted to become.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.820
I answered...

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.300
that I wanted to be an assassin.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.100
I stifled the resentment, the agony—all my true feelings.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.260
I would be an assassin, playing my part until it was time to strike.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.060
I don't care if I die.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.470
As long as I get my revenge.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.740
As I thought. You're not good at following directions.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.810
I even warned you to wait until my preparations were complete.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.080
What do you think you can do?

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.080
You couldn't even look after Itona. So you abandoned him.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:25.090
From the looks of it, your metabolic balance is off as well.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.300
The fate of those who continue to use untamed tentacles...

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.050
Mind your own business.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.470
I'll kill him myself. Just stay out of the way.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.150
Don't be so cold

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.180
to your one and only big brother.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.180
I'll kill you, you animal!

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.330
Now that you bring it up, that's definitely Kayano.
Give me back my mom! Give her back!

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.670
Bring her back to life right now!
Wow. Her countenance and personality are completely different.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.750
No wonder she was able to conceal her identity for almost a year.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.540
Kayano was friends with everyone,

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.540
but she never let anyone get too close.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:15.310
She stayed close to me because she was using my murderous intent to hide her own.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.720
My Plan (Secret)

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.600
Now that I think about it, the giant pudding was a decoy assassination, too.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.520
Because in this class, it would be more suspicious for her not to try anything.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.830
She was acting...

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.490
as the cheerful, fun, and almost- completely-harmless Kayano Kaede.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:39.160
Korosensei, Kayano called you a murderer.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.390
What happened back then?

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:50.220
We've known you long enough that we'll trust you, whatever you say.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:55.670
But you have to tell us about your past.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.510
If you don't, no one will be able to accept what's happening now.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.690
That's what it's come to.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.860
Very well.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.490
I'll tell you everything about my past.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.790
However, Kayano-san is a vital part of the E Class, just like all of you.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.830
I will tell you when the whole class is together.

Dear Korosensei,
Come to the field of zebra grass in the hills behind the school at 7 PM tonight.

Kayano Kaede Korosensei
Dear Korosensei,
Come to the field of zebra grass in the hills behind the school at 7 PM tonight.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.830
So you came.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.150
Let's end this, then.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.580
Korosensei, I'm the one who gave you your name, you know.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.080
So as your mother, I'll take your life, too.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.580
Kayano-san, it's too dangerous to keep using those tentacles!

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.330
If you don't remove them and seek treatment immediately, your own life could be at risk!

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.680
What are you talking about? They're in excellent condition.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.280
Don't even bother trying to throw me off with a bluff.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.420
Kayano...

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.720
Was it all an act?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:22.270
Even when we were having fun? Or overcoming hardship together with everyone?

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.690
It was.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.550
I am an actress, after all.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.400
When Nagisa was defeated by Takaoka-sensei,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.320
I could hardly bear to watch without joining in the fight.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.910
When I was kidnapped by delinquents and kicked by the Reaper,

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.510
I was so angry that I wanted to kill them on the spot.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.470
But I endured it and kept up the frail girl act.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.710
Because if my identity was exposed before I killed him,

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.040
I wouldn't be able to avenge my sister.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.630
Your sister... Yukimura-sensei?

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.070
Hers was truly a wretched fate, to be killed by this monster.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.980
She loved being a teacher.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.380
I heard a little about you all, too.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.410
Come on, you can do it if you try!

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.520
This E Class is a paradise, overflowing with dreams and opportunities!

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.230
Yukimura-sensei...

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.930
You wear really lame shirts sometimes, you know?

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.190
What? These are my best clothes!

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.760
We know, Kayano.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.980
We only had her for two short weeks in the March of our second year,

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.500
but she was a passionate, shining example of a teacher.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.340
Would Korosensei kill Yukimura-sensei just like that?

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.590
He's never done anything that cruel in front of us.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:46.060
Right? At least hear him out, Kaede-chan!

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.470
He even came all the way to my house when I was suspended.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.400
But are you really okay with this?

00:18:55.010 --> 00:19:01.370
I can't imagine that what you're doing now is the best way to resolve this as an assassin.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.000
I'm guessing your body feels hot, but the nape of your neck feels cold.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
That's the abnormal metabolism characteristic of those with implanted tentacles.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.140
If you fight in that condition, you'll really be in trouble.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.030
You'll lose control amidst the heat and agony,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.420
and your life-force will be drained by the tentacles.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.280
At worst...

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.850
Shut up. This is none of your business.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.550
No matter the weakness or shortcoming, anything that's polished can become a weapon.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.110
You're the one who taught me that, Sensei.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.520
If my body's too hot to bear,

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.200
I'll just make it even hotter and gather the heat in my tentacles!

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.660
No! Any more and—

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.940
I'm in the very best condition.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:54.130
My whole body's so sensitive that I won't miss a single opening.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.590
Stop it, Kayano!

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.050
This isn't right!

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.830
I learned this lesson too!

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.370
If you sacrifice yourself to kill someone, there won't be anything left behind!

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.610
I'm not planning on sacrificing myself, Nagisa.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.770
All I'm doing...

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.890
is killing him.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.730
Once I put my mind to something, I just keep on rolling!

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.660
Wow... They're like volcanic bombs.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.080
Kayano... isn't acting? These are her true feelings?

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.040
I snagged a piece! It's still moving!

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.130
She's only been fighting like this for ten or fifteen seconds,

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.960
but the tentacles are already starting to take over her mind.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.930
What's the matter, Korosensei?

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.110
My head doesn't hurt anymore!

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.600
The pain feels good now!

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.060
If they've already taken that much control, it's too late.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.430
Whether or not she gets her revenge,

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.490
she'll only last a few more minutes after that.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.950
Then I think she'll die.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.030
Is this...

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.990
Is this really the assassination Kayano wanted?

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.450
Come on! Die, Korosensei!

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.830
Kayano-san...

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:18.410
Die! Die! Die!

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.060
Korosensei... Kill me...

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.960
Help me!

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.310
