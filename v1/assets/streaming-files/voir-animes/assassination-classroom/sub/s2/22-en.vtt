00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.390
With the "Spear of Heaven"

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.860
and the "Shield of Earth"...

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.530
The government had put their last-resort plan to eliminate Korosensei into action.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.950
We couldn't get them to hear us out.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.410
Our last mission: get to school safely without losing anyone!

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.370
We need to see him.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.780
There won't be closure unless we do.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.900
Time left until the deadline for Korosensei's assassination:

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.040
three hours!

Happy Birthday Time

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.360
Three hours until the Spear of Heaven is fully charged.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.370
It's a shame we'll be destroying him so completely, though.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.560
We'll be losing a rare test sample.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.830
But it's worth it to keep the world safe.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.210
Can those kids make it through?

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.490
What is it?!

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.880
Intruders on the mountain!

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880
Seems they've gotten past the police line!

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.510
It's a mob of monsters!

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.930
What a nightmare!

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.600
I can't tell how many there are!

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.140
Think you can mess with us?

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.760
Okay... Nice teamwork, you three.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.500
We've lost contact with Squad B.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.950
Our intruders must be the real deal. Watch yourself.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.870
Got it.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.260
H-Hey!

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.670
They've got a sniper! Watch out! Location—

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.820
Hey, uh... that didn't sound so great.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.640
He's fine.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.850
I wrapped him up nice and soft, that's all.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.820
This squad's taken care of, Karma.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.810
Okay.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.780
How's things by you?

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.480
Hmm? Right now... Agh! Hot! It burns!

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.360
Ow! It burns!

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.820
Sorry 'bout that! But you're all such pros.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.570
How else am I going to get you to scream?

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.410
See, we need you to holler to lure out a few more reinforcements.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.380
I'd like to take care of two or three more while I'm here.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.900
That's doable, right, Ritsu?

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.380
Yep.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.840
About three more are approaching over the ridge.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.300
There's also a fixed machine gun on the high ground with the fir tree.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.710
Roger.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.770
How about the route from the crimson-glory-vine thicket through the stand of stone oaks?

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.480
Yep, that should be safe.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.560
Okay, Terasaka, go that way, take down their guys,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.270
and advance to the lone pine.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.380
Got it!

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.230
Squads C and D have gone missing!

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.580
I need a status report, pronto!

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.080
What's the meaning of this, Karasuma?!

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.540
That mountain is those students' home turf.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.400
They've spent the last year there tangling with a super-organism,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.540
having fun, and taking classes.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.440
They'll know their way around it blindfolded by now.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.480
Right there, on that patch of campus,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.330
they're the world's most terrifying assassins.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.160
Were you behind all this?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.940
They made their own decision. They formed their own plan.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.070
And they carried it out themselves.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.280
Even if we'd tried to hold them back,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.320
they'd be ready to bust through with everything they had.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.140
He's like a proud father.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.130
Okajima, they're coming your way.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.750
Another fifty meters.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.210
Akabane Karma is the most suited to take command.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.320
With his devilish brain, he'll use anything and everything at his disposal.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.880
What the...

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.100
How many of 'em are there?!

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.770
We're just gonna zap you a little, 'kay?

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.180
This mountain's just covered with traps.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.490
We might've set them for Korosensei, but this works too.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.780
Hey! Lemme down!

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.840
Still some o' you jokers left, eh?

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.550
I will admit: we did let our guards down.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.930
Looks like you kids have a far better command of this place than we do.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.520
Tranquilizer darts, eh?

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.070
But now that I know what I'm up against, that won't make a difference.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.700
Karma!

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.410
You punks...

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.370
If you'd only behave, this could all be over.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.590
Why in blazes are you rebelling this late in the game?!

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.340
This is something we have to resolve ourselves!

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.300
You don't get to march in now and boss us around!

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.650
Please trust us on the whole Korosensei thing!

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.380
Just back off already and let us handle it!

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.070
Karma!

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.570
Nagisa.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.380
Hey! He's still moving!

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.050
You damn brats!

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.720
Finish the job right, you dumbasses!

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.780
You can keep your show-off high-fives!

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.060
No response from any of our troops!

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.390
What?!

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.570
I knew it was you from your very footsteps.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.460
Sensei...

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.240
You've come so far, class.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.710
Korosensei!

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.840
You mean those students crossed the barrier, fully aware of the danger?

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.070
What do they possibly hope to accomplish?!

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.300
They're civilians. We can't leave them to their own devices.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.780
If the target gets desperate, it could be a catastrophe.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.910
Irina and I will go. We can talk them down.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.230
That's the light from the laser.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:38.200
I see. So they'll be firing the killing laser just before midnight.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.290
That much power would even break my Absolute Defense Form.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.130
No way... Korosensei, let's find a way out of here!

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.590
We'll be your hostages, or whatever else it takes!

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.550
There's no stopping that laser now—

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.510
not when people know I'm out there.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.200
Did you know all along that it would come to this?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.870
Even if I don't explode,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.230
you can't expect all these nations not to be afraid of a monster like me.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.910
Sooner or later, they'll want to snuff me out.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.200
It's only reasonable.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.910
If only we'd acted sooner, there might have been a way...

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.370
Like breaking the barrier projectors,

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.290
or making the rounds online and on TV to plead our case!

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.160
Octo-Creature's Students' Tearful Appeal!

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.520
Then you'd have been labeled as even more dangerous,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.300
and you might have been placed under stricter surveillance.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.260
Besides, the projectors' defenses are impregnable.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.920
There are anti-aircraft weapons in place,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.220
poised to launch if I so much as huck a rock at them.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.280
And with your current capabilities and equipment,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.440
you likely wouldn't even make it that far.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.480
That is how perfect this plan was.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.400
They spared nothing, pouring in tech, time, and manpower.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.370
This assassination—

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.790
this realization of the world's combined wisdom and efforts—

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.580
surpasses my own abilities, for which I offer my respect

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.040
and gratitude for the honor of having been its target.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.560
But... then all our hard work getting to this point... was all wasted?

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.580
None of it was, Yada-san.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:27.540
You went all the way to space to find out that my probability of exploding was less than one percent.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.440
That brought the light back to a gloomy and downcast E Class,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.450
and the month that followed was short, but very sweet.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.990
That whole journey—and the dedication in your hearts—is what matters.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.540
You used every last bit of what you'd learned to come and see me.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.900
A teacher can find no greater happiness.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.480
Why won't they just declare that time's up?

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:01.200
It's just one percent! That's a risk we'll take, and gladly!

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.470
Why won't the government and the rest of 'em hear us out, when we're the ones who've been closest to you?

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.440
This octopus is just a harmless perv!

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.030
"We won't listen to what those kids have to say.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.650
We'll just pity them instead."

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.120
It's insulting.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.360
Like we can shut up and take this!

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.950
Next time I see those goons, I'm gonna—

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.370
Terasaka-kun, all of you... Let me give you some advice.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.500
As you go through life,

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.200
there will certainly be times things don't go as you'd hoped

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.340
due to the mighty current of society pushing against you.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.800
When this happens, do not look to society for a cause.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.820
Do not renounce society.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.660
Frankly, you'd be wasting your time.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.880
Instead, just say, "That's life!"

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.690
and muddle your way through the frustration.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.990
Once you're past it, consider:

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.070
if society's swift current is tossing you around,

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.440
how should you be swimming there in its midst?

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.230
You should have learned how, here in the E Class—

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.110
in this assassination classroom.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.560
You don't always have to stand and face it head-on.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.670
You can run, and you can hide.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.630
If it's not against the rules, you can try a sneak attack.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.430
You can use unconventional weapons.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.680
Stay determined— neither impatient nor discouraged—

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.710
and with repeated trial and error,

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.190
you're bound to reach a splendid outcome eventually.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.900
That's because each and every one of you is a top-tier assassin who can do just that.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.110
Geez. A lesson, really? Now?

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.080
Now's just the time for this lesson.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.710
An educator never misses an opportunity to teach.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.420
But you know, for you to try so wholeheartedly to save me...

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.880
I'm so happy I've been holding back tears this entire time.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.380
And I mean that.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.810
How can Korosensei be so calm?

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.800
If he hadn't come to our E Class,

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.660
he might've been able to live a normal life somewhere.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.700
We were Korosensei's...

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.320
By the way, Nakamura-san,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.410
your footsteps were awfully gentle, even during that pitched mountain battle.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.950
And... do I smell something sweet?

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.630
Sharp ears and a sharp nose...

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.090
It's been exactly one year since the day the moon exploded, right?

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.480
As I recall, Yukimura-sensei made today your birthday.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.220
Feel free to praise my skill in getting this here in one p—

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.180
Hey! I'm talking!

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.850
But... It's just...

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.520
It's my first sweet anything in a week!

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.830
Ew, you're drooling!

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.690
Come on, everyone! Let's get singing!

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.150
And... go!

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:13.570
Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you!

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.570
Man, this is some bullshit—tooo youuu!

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:20.020
Happy birthday, dear Korosensei...

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:27.580
Happy birthday to you!

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.090
This is more than enough.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.560
C'mon, blow it out, Korosensei!

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.420
There's just one, so make it count!

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.970
A far greater reward than I deserve.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.410
Happy birthday.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.200
Shi—

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.580
No... Yanagisawa.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.670
The time is ripe.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.060
Let me give you the gift of the world's cruelest death.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.810
Sensei. You know who I am, don't you?

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.560
Why don't I reintroduce him—to your students, too.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:17.180
He's the man who stole the name of the Reaper from that octopus.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.460
And...

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.760
As of today, he's the new Korosensei.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.990

Assassination Classroom Final Season Akabane Karma

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.300
Farewell, my teacher.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.960
You never did see my face,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.510
did you?

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.380
If there were another with my skills,

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.730
the scope of my assassination work would widen considerably.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.690
So when he volunteered to be my pupil, I took him in and trained him.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.880
This was a man who admired power.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.590
And so power he was taught, just as he'd desired.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.380
To cultivate loyalty, I also showed him the absolute gap in power between us.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.260
I gave him profit and awe in spades.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.000
There should have been no risk of betrayal.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.090
Sensei! Looking at our infiltration route for this job,

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.730
wouldn't there be fewer guards if we come in from the east gate?

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.740
Let me handle this, and I'll do all the prep work!

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.180
Mmm. We won't make any changes.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.860
Lead us in through here, as planned.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.540
Sensei, I've thought up a knife move with lots of killing power!

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.990
This dual-wield variation—

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.960
Mmm. Doesn't work, does it?

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.690
If you don't want to introduce more risk to your work,

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.070
master the skills you've been taught first.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.290
It wasn't so much that I was lacking.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.770
I just didn't understand anything back then.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.900
Your student probably just wanted to be seen. By you.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.350
You were my first student, and I...

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.330
I wasn't seeing you.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.790
Yanagisawa...

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:49.310
Was this also part of your plan?

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:54.120
So now we can collect actual combat data and the target's body?

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.470
With just one of those, the whole war on terror would be over.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.400
An unkillable, invincible creature...

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.370
I'm sure our nation would love to put that to practical use.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.600
That's...

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.690
Is that thing...

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.400
The second Reaper... The one who'd attacked us!

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:20.360
Before it was just his face. Now his whole body is monstrous!

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.710
He's just had the same modifications as that octopus.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:30.300
The only difference is that he begged for them.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.920
Completely unlike that failure, Itona, or my little sister-in-law over there.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.470
Can you even imagine?

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.840
A man who overpowered you single-handedly even as a human

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.830
now possesses tentacles as matchless as his hatred.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.710
The resulting destructive power: unthinkable.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.190
Die!
Run away!

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.820
A sonic boom.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.910
His tentacles have an initial velocity of Mach 2.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.740
And they can reach a top speed... of Mach 40.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.670
M-Mach 40?!

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.960
In short, his basic performance is doubled.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.210
The Reaper 2.0's superhuman kinetic vision and intuition are amplified via his tentacles,

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.300
making him readily adaptable to a supersonic world.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.440
Unlike some amateur children, he took to his tentacles readily—

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.640
just like version 1 over there.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.890
Korosensei!

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.730
But the greatest difference is that unlike you and that octopus,

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.990
those tentacles were not designed with long-term operation in mind.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.720
That means he needs no upkeep. He's disposable.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.280
I've made it so he can draw out tremendous levels of energy,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.360
in exchange for shortening his lifespan to three months.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.820
And there's no danger of him exploding at death.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.680
Is this not a safe and invincible weapon?

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.370
You always do this.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.220
You're always hurting others...

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.820
from your safe spot away from it all!

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.170
Is that what you think?

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:18.320
Did you really believe I wasn't fully prepared to die?

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.400
Hey, that's... It can't be...

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.840
I don't give a damn about my life anymore.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.830
If I can kill the creature who stole everything from me, I'd call that a fair trade.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.790
Joints, muscle fibers, the spinal cord, the nervous system—

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:38.980
it may not be a full-body operation, but by gradually implanting tentacles in those key places,

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.720
I can retain my human faculties while becoming something so much more.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.550
Die a pathetic death, guinea pig...

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.970
and scar your beloved students for life!

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.520
Why, you...!

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.750
Class...

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.560
There's something I forgot to mention in my earlier lesson.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.160
Even an assassin who's cleverly avoided all head-to-head battles

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.200
is sure to have at least one encounter in their life

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.960
where they must fight with every last ounce of strength they possess.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.460
And in my case...

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.060
that would be now!

00:21:26.010 --> 00:22:54.790


00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:38.500
komorebi ga yasashiku sashikomu ookina mado no naka
As the dappled sunlight shone gently through the window

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:48.760
kimi to deatta ano hi wo tooku ni kanjita
The day I met you felt so far away

00:21:50.410 --> 00:22:00.000
sukoshi zutsu narabeta omoide wa boku wo atatameru
The memories I've arranged little by little keep me warm

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:13.020
chiisana heya tsunagu kokoro sotto oshiete kureta
A small room, hearts connecting: you taught me gently

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:25.810
kono kisetsu ga mukae ni kitara kimi no sugata mou sagasu koto mo
Once this season comes for me, I won't be able

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:31.050
dekinaku nacchaun da ne dekinaku nacchaun da ne
To seek you out anymore, will I?

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:36.690
zutto wasurezu ni iru yo zutto wasurezu ni iru yo
But I'll hold your memory in my heart

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:42.670
mata kimi ni aeru hi made mata kimi ni aeru hi made
Until the day I can see you again
