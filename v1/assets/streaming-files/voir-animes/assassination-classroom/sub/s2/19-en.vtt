00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.400
Yes! An out-of-season research project for our assassination classroom:

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.690
hijack the space station and steal their experiment data!

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.450
And so the E Class's unprecedented research project began.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.120
"The reentry capsule carrying the research data will splash down in the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.590
The capsule will be transported to the lab unopened,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.090
to guard against the unlikely possibility of theft by the target super-organism."

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.800
Clever precautions indeed.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.280
I can't carry anything too heavy,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.810
so anything locked in a five-ton container is as good as unobtainable for me.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.440
Which is why we need them to show us while it's still in space...

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.860
but does Japan really have the tech to launch a manned rocket?

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.310
At this point, we can handle that much.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.380
My influence might have moved things along.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.620
There was plenty to fear, of course, but above all,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.660
we had the most fun coming together to tackle challenges—

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.080
when we could forget about all our uncertainties.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:02:40.970

Our plans are in place.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.980
Now to put them into action.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.440
The rocket can only hold two people. Who wants to go?

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.450
Me!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.030
Right...

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.570
Oh, of course all the boys do.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.870
It's an unproven experimental vessel on its maiden voyage.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.950
Who still wants to go?

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.980
Right... I still want to.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.330
A rocket would make any mech-head's mouth water.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.200
But I'll give up my seat this time.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.440
Nagisa. Karma.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.650
Huh? I'm not big on putting my life in other people's hands.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.060
Just send Terasaka up with a dummy.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.160
If it crashes, no harm done.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.270
What?!

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.120
Karma, the aggressive fighter, together with Nagisa, the composed assassin!

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.230
They might be a good team for hijacking a space station.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.070
Yeah. We'll save our money and pay our own way.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.920
You two fought as hard as you did to bring the whole class together!

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.460
Take responsibility and lead the way!

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.380
Karma?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.620
Let's give it a shot.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.300
A graduation trip to outer space with your friend?

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.050
What could be better?

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.890
Okay, okay. I did promise I'd do as you say.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.550
Well, then, that's that!

Wow, cool!

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.760
This is where you launch the rockets, right?
Hey! You!

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.230
How did you two get in here?

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.160
You don't even have ID cards, do you?

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.440
We came here on a field trip, but we got lost!

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.160
We followed some guy and wound up here!

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.560
But since we're here... let us do the countdown!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.610
Ritsu, any of these control-room computers should work, right?
I don't care how cute you are: no! Authorized personnel only!

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.410
Right.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.950
Aw, I wanna push the big red button!

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.360
Okay, then... Time to plug this in and scram.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.370
Hey! Tickling won't help!

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.290
Security analysis complete!

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.770
I've placed a remote-control virus on the control-room computer.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.370
Now the control center and its system will act on my command.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.510
That's the first hurdle cleared.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.050
Ritsu, sorry to ask without any notice,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.010
but part of our entry route is out in the open.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.960
Can you do something?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.380
Roger. Checking your current position...

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.270
Done!

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.240
I'll turn off the corresponding camera for ten seconds.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.280
Roger that.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.610
Three... two... one... zero!

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.440
Security guard passing through. Next patrol in ten minutes.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.440
Surveillance camera angle adjustment complete.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.510
It's still live, so please be careful.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.360
Got it.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.240
A fifty-meter staircase to the rocket hatch...

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.000
Korosensei?!

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.870
Inspection? Perfection!

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.440
At least you seem aware you'd be responsible if anything went wrong!

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.660
Please don't say such awful things!

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.460
I'm relaying looped footage of the dummies to the control room.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.460
If you swap them out now, you won't get caught!

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.430
C'mon, Karma.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.140

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.080
You know, we've felt this kind of nervousness before, you and me.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.090
Yeah.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.500
But... we might've changed a little since then.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.140
Five, four, three, two, one... All systems go.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.380
Main engine ignition.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.720
One, two, three... SRB ignition.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.270
Liftoff.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.880
It's fast, all right!

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.450
Why did you tag along, Korosensei?

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.970
Well, you know, I worry.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.820
Don't worry too much about getting that data on me!

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.890
You're on a journey through space! Enjoy it!

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.980
Korosensei...

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.480
There's something I want to say.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:36.200
You use every ounce of your life to give us opportunities to learn.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.820
And we're really grateful for that.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:45.740
But your life means more to us than just teaching material.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.450
I know. And I'm glad.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.460
S-So fast!

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.420
You need to be traveling at Mach 23 to enter orbit.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.250
Today, for the first time, we were faster than Korosensei.

Your country sent you a doll to play with.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.600
How about welcoming it aboard and giving it a big hug?

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.780
Okay!

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.420
Huh?

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.360
Where's the dummy?

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.280
What?!
What the?!

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.210
Huh? A communications error?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.160
What's wrong?

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.200
Huh?!

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.670
H-Hello... Hey, it's Mizui-san! I've seen you on TV!

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.380
What?

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.630
Why is there a kid in here instead of a dummy?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.840
Hey, what's—

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.700
I've terminated the comm-link with Earth!

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.230
Thanks, Ritsu.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.260
We have a bomb.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.310
We would like to do this peacefully.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.770
Please back away so we can talk.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.190
This place is a little cramped.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.900
Let's talk somewhere with more space.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.940
Come on. Move it.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.660
Therefore,

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.780
please allow us to copy the American team's data.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.830
We won't be making any other demands.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.790
I think you know, but our teacher is a monster.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.300
I don't know what he'll do to the Earth if you refuse.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.690
Jeez. These guys calmed down way too quick.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.080
That's career astronauts for you.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:54.520
First, let me give you two daring kids a hand. Bravo.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.480
Oh... You speak Japanese.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.950
But are you really gonna take on the six of us—soldiers included?

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.450
We're not scared of some bomb.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.160
Because...

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.700
we've been running experiments here, not knowing when

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.000
this is all gonna blow up and kill us all.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.740
Enough pointless conflict.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.000
This is no place to fight.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.010
We'll talk, so please, let him go.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.410
Even if you do steal the data, how are you going to get home?

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.810
Are you going to ask us for help after hijacking us?

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.000
We can make it back on our own.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.920
Our classmate's worked out the return orbital calculations perfectly.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.580
Yep!

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.030
Our teacher can do any fine-tuning by pushing us in midair.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.660
This is way too reckless!

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.330
Maybe you're just young, but aren't you taking your lives too lightly?

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.290
I didn't come here because I wanted to.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.500
I came because my friend asked me to.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.490
Karma... And as far as our lives go...

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.670
We've done plenty of thinking in regards to that lately.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.800
I mean, we're students of a class whose aim is to kill its teacher.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.770
We should know by now to be prepared to face life with life.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.170
Just like you, right?

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.240
It seems you have genuine faith in your target's plans.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.220
All right.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.120
I'll take it upon myself to accept the hijackers' demands.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.460
Prepare the data.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.020
But first, help us unload supplies.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.490
We'll put you to work and get you out of here already.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.390
I think they must have wanted to give us junior high kids

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.810
the experience of a lifetime.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.200
This might just save him.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.270
Yeah...

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.550
And that'd be enough for you, right?

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.440
What do you mean?

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.870
Well, I'm not going to oppose the class's decision to save him.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:15.950
I'm just wondering what Korosensei really wanted us to do.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:24.000
That's the lab data on preventing that super-organism from exploding.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.780
No signs of falsification.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.140
I can confirm it's the full data from the experiment in question.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.890
I'll just grab a copy.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.200
It's copied.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.280
Now to get back and validate it.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.550
Yeah, we don't want to overstay our welcome.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.350
Hey, pops!

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.850
You can keep this.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.300
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.690
To tell the truth, it's actually just a block of sweet bean jelly.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.150
Oh, no!

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.580
Just say you were too spooked by the bomb to disobey.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.170
We're really sorry for the trouble we've caused!

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.200
At least it killed some time, right?

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.820
Swimming in zero gravity like they're at a friend's house,

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.340
negotiating for top-secret intel like they're bargaining at a penny-candy shop,

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.800
penetrating the atmosphere like they're heading home from school...

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.390
There are some pretty amazing junior-high kids out there!

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.100
You guys are an awesome group of heroes.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.270
Come back anytime—

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.060
but next time, do it the right way.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.630
I've had enough. However...

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.270
I'll make sure to increase the budget for

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.320
space exploration when I get in power.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.990
Yeah... I'm lookin' forward to it.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.080
Our time in space sure went by in a flash.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.120
Yep.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.620
Now to see if we can get back to Earth in one piece. Ritsu?

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.750
Ritsu...?

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.300
I'm on it.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.390
I've crunched a ton of numbers to get you down safely.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.760
This spaceship might as well be my own body by now.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:02.740
Plus, all those sensors I have are picking up more than ever before.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.510
External temperature, air pressure, speed, the scenery...

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.840
Nagisa-san, Karma-san...

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.280
I even have a clear read on your respiration, your conversation, your pulse, and your warmth.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.420
To think, move, and feel to the fullest...

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.750
How wonderful.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.920
I can feel this mission evolving my intelligence!

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.060
Hey, you two...

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.970
I just felt an emotion for the very first time.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:42.190
I'm glad. Glad I could be a part of this class.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.450
Right on schedule!

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.510
And what a grueling trip it must have—ow!

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.470
Korosensei!

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.870
So I didn't need to intercede in the negotiations after all!

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.430
Those spacemen were surprisingly understanding, weren't they?

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.890
Guess so.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:27.900
Now to give you boys a little shove.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.040
Hup! Ow! Hup! Hot! Ow! Hot!

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.570
Onward to—ow!

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.920
Hey, they made it! They're back!

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.530
Keep going! Almost there!

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.460
We doubted, fretted, came apart, and clashed...

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.550
And finally, at the end of that long month,

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:53.960
we went to space.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.390
Hooray! Yay! They did it!

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:09.800
komorebi ga yasashiku sashikomu ookina mado no naka
As the dappled sunlight shone gently through the window

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.010
Phew... What in God's name have you done?

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:02.810
Urk!

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.390
I can't even conceive of how much apologizing this will take!

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.290
I-I coerced the students into going!

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:20.060
kimi to deatta ano hi wo tooku ni kanjita
The day I met you felt so far away

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.400
You two didn't know of my plan, so you aren't responsible.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.740
Besides, we got a nice bonus out of it:

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.440
data from using real humans instead of dummies.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.150
This alone should make another rocket launch worthwhile.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:31.300
sukoshi zutsu narabeta omoi ga boku wo atatameru
The memories I've arranged little by little keep me warm

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.560
And Ritsu-san discovered a more efficient course into space.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.880
Take all this, and let's call it even.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:44.320
chiisana heya tsunagu kokoro sotto oshiete kureta
A small room, hearts connecting: you taught me gently

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.090
You miscreant.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.460
We're home.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:57.110
kono kisetsu ga mukae ni kitara kimi no sugata mou sagasu koto mo

00:18:44.320 --> 00:19:26.930
Once this season comes for me, I won't be able 

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:02.350
dekinaku nacchaun da ne dekinaku nacchaun da ne
To seek you out anymore, will I?

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:07.990
zutto wasurezu ni iru yo zutto wasurezu ni iru yo
But I'll hold your memory in my heart

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:13.970
mata kimi ni aeru hi made mata kimi ni aeru hi made
Until the day I can see you again

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.980
Whoa! Check out this data!

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.810
It's one thing to get the data, but with all this jargon, I can't understand a word!

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.980
I'll handle it. Here's a summary.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.970
"An experiment in space proved that the risk of explosion for a tentacle creature

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.800
is inversely proportional to its 'size.'

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.030
The bigger it is, the more stable it is,

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.960
while the smaller ones have a higher likelihood of exploding.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.290
Unlike those the size of a small mouse,

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.540
the probability of a human-sized creature going berserk and exploding

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.510
is much lower than expected."

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.720
Huh? That means...

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.060
"Additionally, by administering the medicine indicated below

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.180
and periodically stimulating the flow of silicon compounds in the body...

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.600
Simply put, by 'relieving muscular stiffness,'

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.150
the risk of them going berserk decreases dramatically."

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.610
Stiffness?

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.720
"When the following conditions are satisfied,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.580
the possibility of explosion, even at its highest,

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.320
is less than one percent."

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.840
One percent?!

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:31.810
"It is likely that other cells will die out before any explosion occurs,

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.330
and the creature will peacefully evaporate within ninety years."

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.180
So can you make this medicine or what?

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.210
It's surprisingly easy! In fact... Phew Phew Phew Phew

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.840
Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew Phew

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.870
I made one almost exactly like it before.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.010
Phew Phew Phew Phew

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.220
That one?!

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.220
You're kidding me!

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.810
The key to solving this was right there all along?!

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:55.360
Are you sure? I mean, it was almost too easy to find.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.310
No...

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.410
The road here wasn't easy at all.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.480
Kayano...

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:06.070
We made it here because my sister risked her life to stop Korosensei from turning destructive.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.290
And because Korosensei followed in her footsteps, risking his life to teach us.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.830
If not for the commitment of everyone involved,

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.790
we probably wouldn't have made that medicine,

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.820
and we wouldn't have grown into a class that could look for answers way out in space.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.760
Either way, less than one percent is as good as zero!

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.220
Even if we can't kill him, the Earth won't explode!

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.600
Wait... What about the assassination?

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.480
Huh?

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.620
The one we've been working on since our first term?

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.940
Should we just call it off as of today?

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:50.030
Huh? I... I guess we can. Wait...

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.960
Nagisa! Whaddya wanna do?

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.920
This was your idea.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.960
No matter how minute the possibility,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.490
the government won't cancel its assassination plans—

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.470
not as long as he remains a dangerous creature.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.420
I want to respect everyone's feelings, especially now that we've made it through our hardest challenge yet.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.820
Here's what we decided.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.820
If we couldn't kill Korosensei by the March deadline,

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.120
we'd graduate from assassination

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.490
and go back to being plain old students and teacher.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.620
But until that deadline, we'd wield our blades with conviction.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:44.460
After all, here "assassination" was our bond with our teacher—

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.670
and a required subject through which Korosensei nurtured us.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.670
That's what we made up our minds to do.
