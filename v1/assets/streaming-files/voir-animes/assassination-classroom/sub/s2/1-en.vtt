00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.190
To them, he was the superbeing who'd reduced our moon to rubble

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.440
then announced he'd do the same to Earth by next March. To us, he was Korosensei.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.530
He had a ten-billion-yen bounty on his head.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.620
And we at Class 3-E, the misfits of Kunugigaoka Junior High School known as the End Class,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.830
were tasked with assassinating him.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.250
Even though we managed to identify some of his weak points before summer vacation,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.870
Korosensei's Weak Point #23:
Can't swim Korosensei's Weak Point #14:

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.330
Prone to dampness Korosensei's Weak Point #2:
Loses his composure rather easily

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.920
Korosensei's Weak Point #4:
Punches like a wet sponge Korosensei's Weak Point #8:
Prone to motion sickness

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.750
Korosensei's Weak Point #16:
Vulnerable after molting Vulnerable after molting

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.340
we haven't landed on a definitive assassination so far.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.040
Korosensei's Weak Point #17:
Vulnerable after regeneration

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.170
In Class 3-E, the assassination classroom,

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.090
as our second term descends on us,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.550
the bell signals the start of another school day.

1st Period Maehara Hiroto Summer Festival Time

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.330
It was the last day of our special summer camp.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.070
The last day of our assassination vacation.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.520
We were making the most of what was left of our time on the island.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.250
A test of courage? Now?

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.960
Indeed! What better activity for a midsummer night?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.920
You just want to have some fun.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.970
Unlike you guys,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.840
I've been cooped up in a shell this whole time!

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.840
On a tropical isle, no less!

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.430
A test of courage? Sounds like fun!

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.010
Right?

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.180
But I don't like scary stuff.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.530
No sweat! Korosensei'll be playing the ghosts.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.360
Oh, right!

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.580
We had no idea at the time

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.600
that our teacher had another, baser goal in mind.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.120
Matchmaking!!

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.220
We'll hold it in this sea cave.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.330
Walk through to the exit in pairs: one boy, one girl.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.800
Do you mind this kind of thing, Nagisa?

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.360
Well, I can probably handle creepy stuff, but I'm not much for jump scares.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.730
Korosensei's so fast that he could scare the pants off me if he really wanted to.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.980
Is that an Okinawan banjo?

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.030
There he is!

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.070
This is a blood-drenched cave of tragedy...

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:56.460
where Ryukyu royalty, defeated in battle, met a violent end.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.420
Is it really?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.920
He probably just made it up to make it feel more real.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.440
You must stay together.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.610
Wandering spirits will haunt to death anyone left alone!

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.310
Th-This is sounding pretty authentic.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.190
Let's hurry through, Nagisa.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.690
Uh-huh.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.900
This is a blood-drenched cave of tragedy...

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.770
Hearing him tell the same story to the next couple

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.620
where Ryukyu royalty, defeated in battle...

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.620
makes it feel very real, all right.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.340
You've all grown so much stronger.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.420
But you're still missing a little something.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.540
And that is... Matchmaking!!

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.800
Matchmaking!!
A love scandal!

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.630
I figured a few couples would have formed by summertime,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.640
but you're so focused on assassination that there hasn't been a single love affair!

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.730
Here's where I use fear to give you a little push together.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.880
Then I can tease you... or write a based on-a-true-story novel!

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.610
Such is your teacher's generous consideration!

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.610
Korosensei's Weak Point #12:
Loves gossip

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.570
Fear of what doesn't inspire fear?

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.000
Yep. When I saw Nagisa-kun just then? 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.790
Honestly, I was shocked.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.630
Not when he beat Takaoka. After that.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.340
I didn't find him the slightest bit threatening.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.590
I mean, in a fight, I'd win for sure.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.070
But to an assassin, that kind of victory doesn't mean squat.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.660
That's when I first realized

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.650
what doesn't inspire fear should be feared the most.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.960
Still... I won't lose.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.780
I'll be the one to take that teacher's life.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.480
Uh-huh! Can't wait to see who ends up killing him.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.030
By the way... The Famous Ryukyu

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.410
The Famous Ryukyu Twister Game
Twister Game The Famous Ryukyu
Twister Game

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.320
Wasn't this supposed to be a test of courage?

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.460
The Famous Ryukyu The Famous Ryukyu
Twister Game Twister Game

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.460
'Cause it looks to me like he's got something stupid up his sleeve.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.580
These couples just aren't coming together. The next one, for sure!

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.390
This is a blood-drenched cave of tragedy... where Ryukyu—

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.640
It's a monster!

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.000
I've been spooking out people on the streets at night since I was a kid.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.240
They call me Miss Courage Tester of Japan.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.860
Well, uh... As long as you're havin' fun.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.160
Wh-What was that ghost I just saw?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.360
Korosensei's Weak Point #24:
Spooked by the supernatural, as you'd think
Not the actual spirit of an actual Ryukyu ruler!

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.770
No eyes!

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.160
m 62 362 l 266 362 266 608 62 608
His own konjac contraption

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.190
I just felt something slithery!

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.170
A Japanese doll?!

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.920
The great cartoonist Mizuki Shigeru!

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.510
Turns out he's enjoying the frights more than any of us.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.360
Let's just get out of here.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.390
What a disgrace. What a total disgrace.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.810
So you wanted to use the suspension-bridge effect to frighten couples together?

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.610
We saw right through you before you even scared us!

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.440
B-But I so wanted to see you all!

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.280
I wanted to grin at you holding hands and blushing, two by two!

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.700
Then I'd pop up and go, "Hey, students shouldn't hook up!"

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.700
He's sobbing with frustration.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.200
What a shabby grown-up.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.240
Never mind that stuff.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.790
Most kids our age don't want to be dragged into a love affair.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.890
We're not all as sleazy as you.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.860
All right, Nakamura-san. I get it.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.300
You call that a test of courage? There was nobody in there!

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.510
What a waste of fear!

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.020
I told you there was no point clinging to me like that.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.980
I don't need that kind of baggage after an all-nighter.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.230
Shut up! You're a man, aren't you?

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.690
If there's a pretty woman around, it's your job to escort her nicely!

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.510
Say... I'm starting to wonder... Is Bitch-sensei...?

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.530
Uh-huh.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.740
What should we do?

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.150
We've still got some time before we go home tomorrow morning.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.260
Shall we push them together?

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.780
So much for not being sleazy.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.750
And so our final operation was underway.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.400
Ugh! That does it!

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.360
How dense can one man be?

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.580
This isn't like you. You used to wrap men around your little finger.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.360
When it comes to actual love, you're still inexperienced.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.760
Love? 

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.720
Don't make me laugh.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.310
What, it's not love?

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.020
It was a challenge! You don't see many people as stuffy as him!

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:41.040
So I got all worked up, trying to get him to fall for me,

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.370
and before I knew it, I...

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.670
That was kinda cute.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.130
It feels a little humiliating.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:50.880
What? Why?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.260
Bitch-sensei is more awkward than she appears.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.190
All her experience must get in the way of being true to her emotions.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.220
Just leave it to us!

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.810
We'll set the perfect stage for you two!

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.020
Good idea!

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.520
You kids... Karasuma + Irina Pair-up Plan

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.770
Karasuma + Irina Pair-up Plan

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.820
Let the Class 3-E love consultant meeting come to order!

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.610
Karasuma + Irina Pair-up Plan Eager much, octopus?

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.330
It's only natural to support a colleague in love.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.940
A female teacher's days of desire, infatuated with a man...

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.080
It's got the makings of a bittersweet pure-romance novel!

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.750
You're clearly planning something racier.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.460
First off, Bitch-sensei, you dress all wrong.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.970
Totally. "If it's revealing, it's appealing"?

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.180
That's not what a traditional Japanese guy like Karasuma-sensei likes.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.770
You've got to be more neatly dressed.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.640
Neatly dressed, eh?

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.150
Yeah, like... Kanzaki-chan.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.570
If your outfit from yesterday is dry, could you lend it to her?

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.780
Yeah, sure.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.990
See? One piece of clothing and you're nice and...

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.410
H-How'd that make her sexier?!

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.370
For starters, the fit's completely off.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.130
When I think of Kanzaki-san wearing something sexy like that... Whoo-hoo!

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.710
Well, whatever. We can't fix the sexy.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.300
Compatibility is more important than boobs!

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.300
Does anyone know Karasuma-sensei's type?

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:27.190
Oh! He couldn't stop talking about that one person in that TV commercial.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.140
Said she was his ideal type.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.750
Now, there's a good one. 

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.360
Expression, figure... both ideal.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.440
And there are three of them!

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.320
Ideal military potential, he meant!

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.910
Th-Then how about cooking for him?

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.160
The hotel's dinners are plenty grand,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.580
but why not have his favorite dish together, just the two of you?

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.080
I've only ever seen him eat burgers and cup ramen.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.170
That'll just make the two of them look like outcasts.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.130
There's not a single opening we can use to get you together!

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.360
I'm starting to think Karasuma-sensei's the problem here.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.580
Right? Right?

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.440
And he brushes off my jokes so coldly!

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.190
With no options left, we began dissing Karasuma-sensei.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.440
Let's just do what we can before dinner.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.040
The girls will assist with the styling,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.160
while the boys will get the mood just right at the table.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.760
Roger!

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.880
I thought we'd be eating as a group. 

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.920
What's all this?

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.380
No seats left for you, Karasuma-sensei.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.300
These are the teacher exclusion tactics Class E is known for!

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.340
You lot just get in the way. 

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.810
Feel free to go eat outside instead.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.850
Where'd that come from?

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.260
I just don't understand what goes through junior-high students' heads these days.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.120
Why were we the only ones kicked out?

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.410
Oh, uh... Beats me.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.680
What's with the shawl?

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.280
I bought it at a shop, borrowed a sewing machine,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.750
and modified it into a brand-name lookalike based off online photos.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.920
Home ec always was your specialty.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.960
The field is set.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.640
Go get him, Bitch-sensei!

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:28.970
This shawl...

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.180
It'd never fly in high society.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.260
And this table setting? Clearly the work of an amateur.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.640
This is worlds apart from the top-class establishments I'd use professionally.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.860
Plus, do they have to watch? So much for privacy.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:47.790
And yet...

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.210
What do you know? This is fun!

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.840
I kinda love you kids! Just a little.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.400
I'm going to do this!

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.940
I'll take down this stick-in-the-mud, just you watch!

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.750
A lot's happened on this trip.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.340
But it was certainly worth it.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.350
The students demonstrated their mastery of the fundamentals, albeit in unexpected ways.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.110
If we keep this up, we're sure to kill him during the second term.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.440
I'll be counting on you too, Irina.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.790
What is it?

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.420
Say, Karasuma...

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:52.220
Do you really know what it means to kill?

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.220
Well, that got somber fast.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.820
And look how you've just shoved in that napkin.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.670
I like you, Karasuma. Good night.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.260
Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why don't you just drop dead?!

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.550
You were supposed to tell him you love him, not talk about killing!

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.560
Reveal killings Reveal killings Reveal feelings

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.980
Reveal feelings What kind of half-assed kiss was that?

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.400
Use your tongue, your tongue! Like you always do!

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.780
You bothersome brats! Grown-ups have grown-up circumstances!

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.520
It's okay. Now she'll take her time to work on some decently indecent developments. Right?

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.240
No, not "right," you octoperv!

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.800
I won't give this too much thought. 

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.920
After all, that's my duty.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.700
Prepare yourself. 

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.630
The second term is when we'll train even harder.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.260
When we'll kill you.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.450
And so, our assassination vacation finally came to a close.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.270
But what was that at the end there?

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.570
Was she practicing a new move? Impressive.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.860
Karasuma-sensei's Weak Point #1:
Denser than a neutron star

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.950
Assassination Classroom Second Season Shiota Nagisa

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:40.580
There we were, all spending the last day of summer in our own ways.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.580
Traditional Edo-Style Sushi-Go-Round

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.540
Getting along with Mom all right?

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.620
Must be tough when she's so strict.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.300
I feel bad for practically bailing on you.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.400
It's okay. She's not so strict if you don't tick her off.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:02.940
I see.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.330
But anyway, I—

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.650

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.530

It's the last day of summer vacation! Let's hang out and have some mindless fun!

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:19.490
Let's hang out and have some mindless fun!

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.490
It's the last day of summer vacation!

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.420
Thanks!

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.600
Hey, uh, thanks for the sushi, Dad!

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.730
Huh? Wait, you're done already?

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.670
There's something I need to do.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.490
See you! Take care of yourself and all that!

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.820
Glad to see you've cheered up, Nagisa.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:42.890
Huh?

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.390

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.610

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.640
All right.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.280
I was just lazing around anyway.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.810
A festival, eh?

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.000
I'm pleased my target would think to invite me,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.240
but I'm afraid I'm out of Japan on another job at the moment.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.990
I'll come pick you up!

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.100
Karasuma-sensei's in a meeting or something—no one'll be there!

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.260
Korosensei's Weak Point #25:
Thinks a poor turnout means he's worthless
Don't be silly. I'm working.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.890
Well, all right. Come by and kill me anytime, okay?

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.370
But of course.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.610
From what Karasuma's told me,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.150
that boy pulled off the secret move I taught him with no difficulty at all.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:40.160
Every country has its prodigies.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.450
His talent's wasted on Japan, though.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.790
From the moment you were born,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.630
I've always been at your side.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.680
Fear not the name of the Reaper.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.240
We got a real good deal!

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.280
Yeah!

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.700
It's so fizzy!

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.040
A bigger turnout than I expected! Excellent, excellent.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.720
If no one showed up, I really might have offed myself.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.370
I guess we shouldn't have come, then.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.430
Chiba-kun and Hayami-san? Why so glum?

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.010
We got banned from the shooting gallery.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.320
It was too easy. We got carried away.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.840
What am I gonna do with these?
Hey, mister...

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.770
I spent five thousand yen and never got any better than fifth place.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.180
Going by the number of strings and prizes left,

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.990
the probability of never getting fourth-place or above is...

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.930
Wow! 0.05 percent!

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.330
Are any of these strings a winner? 

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.080
Maybe I ought to get a police officer over here to check!

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.890
All right, all right!

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.120
You can have your money back. Just keep your mouth shut, kid!

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.040
No, no, no. I didn't spend five thousand yen to just get my money back.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.020
I want a game console!

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.310
Karma-kun sure is persistent.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.880
He must've figured from the start that none of 'em were big winners.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.680
There you go again, Isogai. Is there anything you can't do?

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.190
There's a knack to it. It's a lot like slicing with a knife.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.170
That'll do.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.040
When you're poor, getting a whole meal for a hundred yen is a godsend.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.800
Right.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.490
I could grill them, stir-fry them, deep-fry them...

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.320
What? He's gonna eat those?

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.030
Everyone's really raking it in, huh?

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.290
Yeah. We're putting the subtleties of our assassination skills to work.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.310
And Bitch-sensei is in the Chamber of Commerce tent, making everyone buy her drinks.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.290
Where's Korosensei?

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:59.330
He's always short on money around the end of the month, so...

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.890
He's running food stalls?!

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.320
And he keeps branching out, too.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.250
He's moving into stalls that closed up early after our class milked them dry.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:14.900
I get it. So we unwittingly helped him earn his spending money.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.820
Wow!

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.390
Nice!

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.740
What a beauty!

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.480
Our summer break sure was packed.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.420
Yeah.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.860
But I bet our second term'll be even more packed.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.470
If one person kills him, the ten-billion-yen bounty stands.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.400
But given the summer report

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.050
indicating that group tactics had him cornered,

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.690
a successful group assassination will reap a greater reward:

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:06.110
Extremely Dangerous and Destuctive Creature
Assassination Wanted Assassination Wanted Max Reward:
Max Reward:
an increased total bounty of thirty billion yen.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:01.400
Assassination Wanted Assassination Wanted

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:05.570
Assassination Wanted Assassination Wanted

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.290
The one thing we knew for sure in this classroom

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:16.100
was that neither we nor Korosensei would be the same when it was all over.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:21.860
Sure enough, our second term had started off with a bang.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.490
The moon that floats in the night sky
yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:46.720
If you stretch out your hand, you can reach it
te wo nobaseba todoku no te wo nobaseba todoku no

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:53.120
I went to touch it: it was warm

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:57.330
sotto furete mita atatakakute And slowly drew me in

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.330
And slowly drew me in jinwari suikomareta
jinwari suikomareta

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:09.110
The multiplying footprints, the view from my window
fueteku ashiato mado kara miru keshiki mo

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:15.220
As I drifted along, expressionless
muhyoujou ni nagare nagara muhyoujou ni nagare nagara

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.650
They spilled out of my hands ryoute kara koborete yuku
ryoute kara koborete yuku

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:26.570
It was rocking, swaying... I never knew
yurayura yureteta shirazu ni ita

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:32.070
Until I touched it with my own hands
kono te de furete miru made kono te de furete miru made

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:37.450
I want to gather up and go through all of the things
kaketa tsuki no shita chirabatta mono

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:44.840
Scattered beneath the waning moon
hiroiatsumete tashikametai sono subete wo
