00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.900
It ended up being a pretty long story, but Itona-kun,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.440
who had previously attacked Korosensei three times, finally joined our class.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.070
Then, one week later...

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.780
All right, class, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.120
I finally got paid, so I'm heading out for some Shanghai hairy crab!

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.710
Yi, er, san, go!

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.080
No fair! Take us too!

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.040
Now that it's the second term, our work's getting a lot harder.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.060
Korosensei's really trying to get our grades up.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.800
That's nice and all, but I haven't picked up any girls in ages.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.670
You're sticking around, Itona-kun?

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.050
What are you making?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.360
Just what it looks like:

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.760
an RC tank.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.860
Why?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.140
I had an all-day cram session with that octopus yesterday.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.780
It stressed me out.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.380
We'll save that for later. Now for your next question...

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.630
He really ticked me off... so I'm gonna use this to kill him.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.000
It's like Terasaka's dumb face told me:

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.970
I can fail a hundred times, no sweat.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.040
So I'll go kill him, expecting the worst.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.390
Go kill him? You mean... B-But this thing...

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.200
It's like, crazy high-tech!

4th Period Kimura Masayoshi Spinning Time

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.240
Is this for real?

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.450
This thing uses cell phone camera parts.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.520
Wow, Itona.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.920
You thought up these tweaks yourself?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.740
I learned basic electronics at my old man's shop.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.680
Anybody could do it, unless they're literally Terasaka.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.950
Itona-kun's changed so much from when he had those tentacles.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.810
Tongue's as sharp as ever, though.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.280
Whoa!

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.050
Amazing... It's practically silent when it moves and when it shoots!

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.300
I used a lot of electronic controls to minimize gear noise.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.770
The camera feed is sent to the controller,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.980
and it moves in tandem with the main gun's sights.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.060
Wow, real spy stuff!

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.280
Even if you can aim this at him... where would you aim?

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.440
I'll let you guys in on a little something.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.350
There's one ideal place we should be aiming for:

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.280
our target's vital organ.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.200
Korosensei's vital organ?!

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.790
He has a heart. Right under his tie.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.210
If we hit that, we can take him down in a single strike.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.220
He'll probably have spread the word by now—

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.330
about my vital organ, that is.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.670
Korosensei's Weak Point #26:

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.140
His heart Korosensei's Weak Point #26:
His heart
These assassinations are bound to get a lot more fun with Itona-kun in the mix.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.180
Korosensei's Weak Point #26:

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.100
We can use this.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.200
Yeah.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.310
Okay, let's give it a test run in preparation for the assassination.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.350
If it breaks during the real deal, we'll be screwed.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.110
Dead slow ahead!

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.080
Bye, Bitch-sensei!

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.880
See you later!

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.160
Go straight home, now! No detours!

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.750
We will!

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.800
Want to stop for a snack?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.170
Yeah, let's!

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.140
But you just said...

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.760
See anything?

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.720
No, the camera didn't get that far. The field of view is too narrow!

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.370
Can't we put in a bigger camera?

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.600
It'll increase the weight, decrease its mobility,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.840
and make target acquisition more difficult.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.760
In that case...

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.570
Why don't we use a fisheye lens on the camera?

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.030

Got it. I'll find a small fisheye lens with a wide viewing angle.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.600
Yes?

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.030
Can you build a distortion correction program?

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.930
Sure! I'm not sure what you'd need it for, but I'll take care of it!

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.340
You're a genius, Takebayashi.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.360
We need a recording function.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.350
Yeah. It's a must for effective analysis of our upgrades.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.980
So much for taking the moral high ground against the underwear thief.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.650
All in the name of assassination! Onward!

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.750

Thanks, Kimura!

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.410
Shouldn't its suspension be able to handle uneven surfaces?

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.750

This light khaki chassis color is too obvious.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.150
That's combat camouflage.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.370
It needs to blend into the school scenery, or the target might notice it.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.520
I'm on it.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.270

How do you like this school camo?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.980
You guys do realize we're planning an assassination here, right?

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.750
Yeah, yeah. We know, Mr. Class President!

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.520
All right, let's get in a test run before the girls show up!

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.820
Yeah!

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.840
Nobody's tardy on a day like this.

Move! It's my turn!

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:13.170
There was no need to worry whether the antisocial Itona-kun would fit in with our class.

Sex, violence, and making things:

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.850
he ticked all the boys' boxes, and before he knew it, he was the center of attention.

Itona, we're all working on this together.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.860
Why don't you give this thing a code name?

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.790
I'll think about it.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.110
The tentacles once asked me what I wanted to be.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.280
When I said I wanted to be strong,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.300
before long, that was all I could think about:

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.020
hazy thoughts of fighting and winning.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.370
You can start with a fine thread.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.640
Over time, you'll spin it into something stronger.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.300
Itona: "growing thread." My wish for you, right there in your name.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.220
How did I ever forget my roots?

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.890
Ack, it crashed! Terasaka, you suck at this!

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.080
Say what?!

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.920
Hey, Itona, isn't this lever a little loose?

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.990
This is probably where I should have started all along.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.660
A monster!

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.440
Run! No, fire!

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.180
The main gun's nowhere near strong enough!

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.890
Gotta tweak that, too!

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.290
Eeeyikes!

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.880
Damn it.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.320
To think we got done in by a weasel.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.950
Next time we'll need to assign a driver and a gunner.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.870
You're on firing duty, Chiba.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.600
- Gunner - Chiba Ryuunosuke Uh... okay.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.770
Mistakes are all part of the development process.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.730
Itona Mk.1 may have been a dud, Itona Mk.I Itona Mk.I

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.280
Itona Mk.I Itona Mk.I Itona Mk.I Itona Mk.I Itona Mk.I

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.860
Itona Mk.I but we'll spin it into something stronger.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:57.450
Itona Mk.I Itona Mk.I Itona Mk.I Itona Mk.I

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.120
I can fail a hundred times,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.800
but I will kill him in the end.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.330
Hope I can count on you.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.560
You bet.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.210
Bloodlust is what binds us together.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.840
This is going to be fun.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.700
All right! By March, we'll have this thing looking up all the girls' skirts!

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.330
So that's our goal now?

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.360
What's this about up our skirts?

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.310
Kataoka!

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.480
Nothing! We were talking about side skirts on cars, that's all!

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.640
Oh, we heard you.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.000
Boys are the worst.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.730
And just who came up with this idea?

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.680
I hope it wasn't you, Itona.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.510
Okajima.
Hey!

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.840
Good morning!

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.560
Oh, Okajima-san!

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.200
I have that fisheye lens correction program ready for you.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.030
Wait! It wasn't just me! Right?

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.880
No idea what you're talking about. Leave me outta this, Okajima.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.760
Maehara, you dirty rat!

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.090
Just give it up, guys.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.880
Either way, it's clear you were all in on this little scheme.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.930
Boys are the worst.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.810
What's going on?

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.880
Kind of a crime of passion.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.890
Huh.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.650
No, it's like, all adventurous!

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.110
You boys are hopeless.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.640
Karma, I'm skipping today.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.780
Show me somewhere cool.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.200
Wow, you can talk!

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:22.780
Sure.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.280
Hey, you! Itona!

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.770
Itona-kun's tougher than we thought.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.960

Assassination Classroom Second Season Shiota Nagisa

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:39.590
Itona Horibe

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.590
Oh, so "Itona" is written with the characters for "growing thread"?

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.380
One of those fancy-pants names!

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.070
Hey!

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.760
It's a good name! Sounds cool.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.050
There are plenty of people with weird names in this class.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.850
What? It's read "Justice"?! I totally thought it was "Masayoshi"!
Kimura Masayoshi Kimura Masayoshi Kimura Masayoshi

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.440
Everyone's kind enough to read it that way, yeah.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.190
And I asked Korosensei to call me that, too.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.290
Sure made us nervous, hearing your name at the entrance ceremony.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.890
Yeah, I guess.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:12.330
I'm not looking forward to being humiliated in public again at graduation.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.880
Kimura-kun's parents are police officers.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.550
Justice Justice
They were so high on justice that that was what they named their child.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:25.600
And being my parents, they'd just smack me if I complained about it.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.230
They didn't think about how much hell kids can get put through in school.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.980
That's parents for you.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.000
Just look at me. They called me Kirara.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.280
Do I look like a Kirara to you?

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.480
N-No...

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.640
My mom lives in her own little fantasy world,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.700
but if something happens that she doesn't like, she goes into screaming hysterics.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.760
Imagine the stress of growing up in that house.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.180
No way was I going to grow into my adorable little name.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.920
You've sure got it rough, saddled with such weird names.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.210
Akabane Karma Oh, me?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.440
I actually rather like my name.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.600
Guess some kids inherit their folks' strange tastes.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.890
Hmm... I'm not satisfied with how I was named, either.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:14.800
Huh?

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.950
I though you liked "Korosensei."

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.820
Kayano named you that.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.190
I do like it. That's why I'm not satisfied.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.970
There are still two people who won't call me by that name.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.800
Karasuma-sensei just says "Hey" or "You there."

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.910
We're not some middle-aged married couple!

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:39.380
But it's embarrassing for a full-grown adult to be like, "Korosensei!"

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.300
Then why don't we call each other by code names instead?

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.590
Code names?

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.180
Yeah. We make new names for everyone.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.760
Like the assassins we met on the island:

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.250
they called each other by code names to hide their real ones.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.400
Don't you think it's kinda cool and assassin-y?

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.980
I see. Good idea!

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.860

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.070

Lottery Box Write down your suggestions.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.780
We'll call each other by the names I pull out of this box.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.990
Sounds fun, but do we have to think up names for everyone?

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.580
I'm just writing down whatever comes to mind.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.460
All right, so for today... you may not call each other by your real names!

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.920
Whaaat?

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.590

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.680

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.640
So how did it feel, spending the day under code names?

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.570

Why was I the only one with my real name?

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.140
Because I knew what you'd be doing in phys ed training today.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.520
I figured, with your mobility, you'd play quite a role.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.300
And given the awesome moves you pulled off,

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.660
the name "Justice" is a perfect fit.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.030

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:21.280
it should be relatively easy to put in for a name change.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.740
Oh, right!

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.600
Still, Kimura-kun...

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:31.360
If you manage to kill me, I bet this is how the world will see your name:

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.280
"'Justice' indeed! A perfect name for the hero who saved Earth!"

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.760
To be honest, there's no great meaning to the grand names our parents give us.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:48.460
What's meaningful is what the people so named accomplish in their lives.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.640
Names don't make a person.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.420
They're merely left behind in our footsteps as we walk through life.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:18:00.420
How about cherishing that name for a while longer?

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.890
At least...

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.480
until the assassination's over with.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.540
Okay?

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.980
I think I will.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.840
So... Today's the day we all use code names.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.160
Now to tell you mine!

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.790
From now on, please call me:

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.560
Why do you get to pick such a fancy-pants name?!

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.720
And what's with that smug look?

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.510
Aw, c'mon, why not? Just for one day!

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.260
Korosensei spent the rest of the day

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.760
as "The Pervy Octopus of Spineless Stupidity."

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:48.480
Code Name The Pervy Octopus of Spineless Stupidity

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.560
The Pervy Octopus of Spineless Stupidity!

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.480
Huh? Octopus?!

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.690
That was a blast!

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.650
Code Name Specs Code Name Specs

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.650
Sure was funny today, using code names in class.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:57.920
That it was.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.830
Right, Dennis the Menace?

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.900
Can it, Baseball Brain.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.970
Ouch!

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.860
What does it even mean?

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.930
Yeah, and whose big idea was it to put me down as "Forever Flat," huh?

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:11.700
Gulp!

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.790
So it was you.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.280
Code Name The Art of Darkness See you tomorrow.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.270
Hey, I'll put up with that nasty ramen again today.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.950
C'mon.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.220
Now look here...

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.030
He's totally a Terasaka guy.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.060
He really is.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.980
And so the days went on, each of us giving it our all.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.880
But we were the End Class.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.260
Our fun times couldn't last forever.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.870
How's the second term coming?

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:53.040
Of course, as my son, you should know that "poorly" isn't an option in the A Class.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.540
Quite smoothly.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.510
I'm thorough in my handling of any students who lag behind even the slightest bit.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:05.470
I'll aim for the midterms and train them even harder.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.840
How encouraging.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.960
However, the students still talk about when you let the E Class

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.940
get carried away during first term...

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.150
owing, I'm sure, to your inexperience at the time.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.370
I'll be sure to crush them...

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.330
as one of the strong.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:38.420
Of course. Not having students to fill the roles of "the strong" and "the weak"

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.130
would run counter to my educational principles.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:49.140
Allow me to impart upon you some guidance, for your own sake,

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.100
about what separates the masses from the leaders who stand at the peak.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.610
First, consider where and when you want to win.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.890
Then consider how.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.660
How will you capitalize upon loopholes in the rules to best utilize the pieces you hold?

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.930
That is the true measure of a leader.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.870
If you cannot do that, you'll never best me, Asano-kun.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.940
All right.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.590
I'll show you what I can do,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.590
Mr. Principal.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.410
The moon that floats in the night sky
yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:46.640
If you stretch out your hand, you can reach it
te wo nobaseba todoku no te wo nobaseba todoku no

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:53.040
I went to touch it: it was warm

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:57.250
sotto furete mita atatakakute And slowly drew me in

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.250
And slowly drew me in jinwari suikomareta
jinwari suikomareta

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:09.030
The multiplying footprints, the view from my window
fueteku ashiato mado kara miru keshiki mo

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:15.140
As I drifted along, expressionless
muhyoujou ni nagare nagara muhyoujou ni nagare nagara

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.570
They spilled out of my hands ryoute kara koborete yuku
ryoute kara koborete yuku

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:26.490
It was rocking, swaying... I never knew
yurayura yureteta shirazu ni ita

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:31.990
Until I touched it with my own hands
kono te de furete miru made kono te de furete miru made

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:37.370
I want to gather up and go through all of the things
kaketa tsuki no shita chirabatta mono

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:44.760
Scattered beneath the waning moon
