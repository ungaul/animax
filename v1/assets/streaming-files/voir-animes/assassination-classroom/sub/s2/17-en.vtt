00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.080
I don't know if it's even possible,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.020
but I want to find a way to save Korosensei's life.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.280
Save his life?

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.990
You mean find a way to keep Korosensei from exploding come March?

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.910
Do you have any ideas?

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.500
Not yet.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.600
I don't know, but...

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.080
I'm in!

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.670
I wanna look for tons more creepy-crawlies with Korosensei!

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.620
Kurahashi-san...

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.010
If you hadn't said something, I would have.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.300
I want to repay him.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.870
Kataoka-san...

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.050
Our assassination work has gotten us far enough.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.540
Let's tackle a whole new challenge!

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.520
Like launching a new series!

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.730
We'll regret it if we don't.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.280
We should do what we can, at least.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.500
You guys...

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.490
Thank goodness.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.950
I'm glad they feel the same way.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.690
Amen to that, Okano!

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.110
I hate to spoil the mood...

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.670
but I'm against the idea.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.650
Huh?

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.090
Our relationship is one of assassin and target. Korosensei said as much.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.880
And I really treasure the bond we've built over this past year.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.340
But that's exactly why I think we have to kill him.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.820

You're against it?

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.640
You say you wanna save him, but how, exactly?

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.720
W-Well—

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.360
It's not like we haven't thought about it.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.420
But what if time runs out before we find a way?

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.930
You think that octopus'll be happy to meet some wishy-washy end with a buncha wishy-washy students?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.640
B-But isn't it at least worth consid—

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.970
It's always the talented ones,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.190
mistakenly thinking everything will go their way.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.440
Hey, Nagisa-kun, aren't you getting a tad full of yourself?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.590
Huh?

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.890
Here you are, the most gifted assassin in the E Class,

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.910
and you're suggesting we just give up on the assassination?

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.010
What about the less talented students who are still giving their all to kill him, even now?

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.880
To put it another way,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.170
it's like a hot woman telling a bunch of homely ones they should all quit trying so hard to find boyfriends.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.990
Th-That's not what I mean.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.350
Besides, when it comes to assassination, you're way better than me.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.210
You saying that just ticks me off even more.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.560
Isn't it more like you're the worst at understanding how the less powerful feel?

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.970
No! That's not it!

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.740
I'm being honest with my feelings!

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.010
Do you hate Korosensei that much?

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.450
Remember the movie he took us to? Remember all the fun we had?

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.600
That's just it!

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.380
That octopus put everything he had into making a fun classroom

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.670
that wouldn't turn out lazy losers like you!

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.050
This classroom couldn't exist if our bloodlust were blunted!

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.550
Can't you see all his hard work?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.900
Or do you have the brains of a little kid to match your body?

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.470
Oh?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.070
Huh? What's with that look?

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.340
An itty-bitty mouse like you, defying a great big human?

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.600
I just... Got something to say?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.620
How about you say it after beating me in a fight for once?

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.030
I'll gladly take you on. Bring it.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.830
What's the matter? C'mon!

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.840
A-A flying triangle choke!

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.280
I...

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.010
am not making this suggestion lightly!

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.010
When did Nagisa-kun learn that?

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.720
Still...

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.580
He's no match for Karma in combat!

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.940
Why, you... Stop that!

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.400
What the hell are you two trying to prove?!

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.070
Urgh! This guy is crazy strong!

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.490
Dammit! Chill out already!

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.360
A junior-high fight? Most excellent!

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.210
Ma, this classroom is all about the assassinio, capisce?

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.130
Shouldn't you be deciding things with these?

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.470

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.100

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.720
First, each student will state their position clearly and choose a color.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.930
Then you'll do battle here on this mountain.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.660
The class will accept the winning team's decision.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.420
Win or lose, no grudges allowed!

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.790

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.270
If you care about me... just promise me that won't happen.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.330
Blue Red Well?

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.980
Blue Red All right. We'll settle it with these.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.450
To kill,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.100
or not to kill?

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.260
Okay. I guess I'll choose first.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.330
Me too.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I think we've come a long way only because of the time we've spent working toward that killing shot.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.380
And as for who—or what—brought us this far...

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.240
We don't want to take our eyes off that target.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.050
So...

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.100

When I tried to kill Korosensei, I regretted it.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.740
I wanted him to live longer.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.200

The power of science is infinite!

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.240
I've come to recognize that the target's death

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.380
would be our greatest loss.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:03.410
It's difficult to determine the correct decision with my current specifications.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.210
In the spirit of cooperation, I will remain neutral.

I was in the don't-kill camp...

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.630
but after hearing everyone's thoughts, I'm not so sure.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.050
Korosensei, killing you doesn't mean we don't like you, right?

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.230
Of course not, Okano-san.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.560
In fact, when you're trying to kill me is when I feel closest to you all.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.730
In that case... Sorry, Nagisa.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.780

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.800
Those two have been friends for a long time, right?

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.050
Yeah, they've been classmates since our first year, and they hang out a lot.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.610
Well, for all that...

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.890
there's still this space between them.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.570
It's like they treat each other like guests or something.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.150
Even the way they talk to each other...

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.380

Steal the other team's flag or wipe them out to win.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.180
I'll be the referee.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.150
I'll make calls and watch for zombies and other illegal plays from the midpoint.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.880
Aside from that, I'll pretend that I don't know where you're attacking from,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.880
so don't worry.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.680
Even if they stick with the assassination,

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.750
they won't succeed with doubts in their minds.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:11.240
It's one big gamble whether the class will get to focus on assassination again.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.590
All right. Let our assassination classroom's paintball civil war...

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:19.590

Kanzaki-san's an ace at this online shooter.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.260

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.010

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.670

Yukiko... She's not one to show off her true ability, is she?

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.110
Yes, and she has a most proper battle style.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.960
A frontal breakthrough on this field is extremely difficult,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.320
so normally you'd circle around from the outside and attack.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.780
However...

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.850
That's right. You trained on a virtual battlefield, didn't you?

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.460
But once I know you're targeting our key positions,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.920
all I need to do is lie in wait for you along the way.

Mimura, see that high point to Karasuma-sensei's right?

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.310
Head there.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.120
Okay!

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.280
Don't let anyone see you.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:08.410
Terasaka, you and the other two stooges are on defense at Face Rock.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.080
It'll be big trouble if they make it past there, so play it tight.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.650

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:13.870

Ah, well done out there.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.730
How careless of me. I can't believe I got killed right at the start.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.520
It was probably on Karma-kun's orders.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.630
So all this time...

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:30.100
that red-headed kid was the one who'd been downplaying his abilities the most?

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.560
Karma! I'm in position!

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.440
Okay. You should see the enemies' positions pretty well from there.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.560
I'll give orders to the team once you report on those.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.850
Mimura's unassuming looks are perfect for covert ops,

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.830
and his producer's eye makes for a wide field of view.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.760
Hence his knack for reconnaissance in force—

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.360
not that anyone in our class ever noticed.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.790

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.280

Muscling the slim-figured Hazama-san deep into enemy lines...

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.770
Karma-kun can't have expected her to get away alive.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:30.320

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.780
one of them Sugino, the close-combat superstar.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.060

Chiba can shoot with greater range and accuracy,

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:14.230
but her kinetic vision and sense of balance are miles better.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.200
A fast-paced battlefield like this is where she really shines.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.410

we'll have to break through Terasaka and his stooges' solid defenses,

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.730

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:59.610
While they're scuffling with Rinka, I'll rush in with you as my shield.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:04.760
By the time you three are dead, I'll have had plenty of time to get to the flag.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.000
So you're sacrificing us? Geez, you'll stop at nothing!

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.160
Well, duh!

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:16.250
I want to win this battle indisputably so we can kill Korosensei as a class, as we should!

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:25.060
Nakamura, you wanted to be a dummy, so you did dumb stuff,

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.480
and joined the "kill" faction first outta some sense of duty to protect our bond.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.940
Y'know, you might be the most no-nonsense one outta all of us.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.540
Hmph.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:41.110
The plan's as ready as it'll ever be. The only disconcerting part...

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.530
would be that not even Mimura can find where Nagisa-kun is.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.230
Okay, guys, forget about defense.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.410
We go after Hayami and Itona with everything we've got.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.880
If we kill those two, Karma'll be the only one guarding the flag!

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.690
Let's settle this once and for all!

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.880
Now! We're going in too!

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:01.920
Hah!

m 489 452 l 533 452 533 495 489 495
Surround them from the left!

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.720
Isogai's in the lead? If I can just take him down, this is as good as won!

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:18.570
I hate conflict, and I've never once shot better than Rinka.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:22.010
But just this one shot... for Korosensei!

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.240
I got her!

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.490
And they got me.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.970
I knew I was more of a knife guy.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.670
No way I can hit you guys with a gun.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.000
Damn! They got you?!

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.040
Doesn't matter. Now the flag's under-guarded.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.320
Nakamura, go get it.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.140
You bet!

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.070
A-An attack from behind at point-blank range?

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.280
It came so suddenly... and out of nowhere!

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.480
There wasn't a soul there until just now!

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:36.080


00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:37.390
komorebi ga yasashiku sashikomu ookina mado no naka
As the dappled sunlight shone gently through the window

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:47.650
kimi to deatta ano hi wo tooku ni kanjita
The day I met you felt so far away

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:58.890
sukoshi zutsu narabeta omoi ga boku wo atatameru
The memories I've arranged little by little keep me warm

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:11.910
chiisana heya tsunagu kokoro sotto oshiete kureta
A small room, hearts connecting: you taught me gently

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:24.700
kono kisetsu ga mukae ni kitara kimi no sugata mou sagasu koto mo
Once this season comes for me, I won't be able

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.940
dekinaku nacchaun da ne dekinaku nacchaun da ne
To seek you out anymore, will I?

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:35.580
zutto wasurezu ni iru yo zutto wasurezu ni iru yo
But I'll hold your memory in my heart

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:41.560
mata kimi ni aeru hi made mata kimi ni aeru hi made
Until the day I can see you again
