00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.800
Bitch-sensei, those presents we got yesterday are fantastic!

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.150
Yeah, our new P.E. gear really kicks things up a notch!

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.070
I proposed a design for those, you know.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.130
That Karasuma wanted the same style for both boys and girls!

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:22.580
The Karasuma

The Irina

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.580
The Compromise

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.210
Sure glad we didn't go with the Irina.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.580
It's cute, but it's a little lacking in defense.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.000
That man just doesn't get women.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.230
He never even gave me a present!

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.540
Huh?

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.340
Oh, that's right. Four days ago, October 10th...

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.100
...was Bitch-sensei's birthday!

7th Period Kataoka Megu Reaper Time, Part 1

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.610
In the past,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.470
I've had plenty of sugar daddies give me all kinds of pricey gifts.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.050

any gift not from him is just worthless junk.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.460
And I still can't get a hold of Lovro-sensei.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.260
Ugh. I couldn't feel more alone.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.210
Bitch-sensei, teach us more conversational French!

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.640
Megu...

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.880
That's right. You wanted to work overseas, didn't you?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.430
Yes. Or something along those lines.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.570
Oh, all right, then.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.270
Have a seat—

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.590
Say, isn't the weather nice? Let's do it outside!

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.820
Huh? Why—

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.650
C'mon, now, let's go!

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.250
Geez, if we weren't here to push 'em along...

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.870
We've successfully separated those two.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.540
Fingers crossed for the birthday-present-buying squad.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.730
But what can we do?

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.670
Bitch-sensei's probably already gotten just about every gift there is.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.190
It's a tough one.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.880
Between everyone in class who pitched in, we have 5,107 yen.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.180
What's a good present for a grown woman we could buy with this?

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.180
I knew it!

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.330
Hey, you guys!

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.660
Did everything turn out okay? You know, with the old guy's leg?

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.560
Oh, you're the florist who called the ambulance!

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.750
Thank you so much for your help. He found it in his heart to forgive us.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.200
Ah. I'm glad it wasn't anything serious.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.190
And now you'd like to find a gift— something for a grown-up?

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.540
Oh, yes.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.000
How about something like this?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.080
I get it! A bouquet!

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.230
In this age, with more presents to choose from than ever before,

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.150
why do you think flowers are still a popular go-to gift?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.670
It's not just about heart.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.610
With their color, shape, fragrance, and even their very impermanence,

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.430
they appeal perfectly to humans on an instinctual level.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.550
Wow, that's pretty persuasive!

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.440
A very fine speech indeed...

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.790
somewhat spoiled by the calculator in your hand.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.680
Well, uh, it is a business.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.530
So what'll it be?

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.450
It's flowery fate! I'll cut you a deal.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.200
And then what? What magic word slays French guys?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.460
Geez, Touka, you're hanging on my every word today.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.170
I'm just really curious, that's all!

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.640
Bitch-sensei, play piano for us later, like you did before!

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.060
Bitch-sensei, strike one of your killer poses!

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.020
No fair! I was first!

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.960
What...

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.230
What's with me today? I'm so popular!

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.820
All right, bring it on! I'll deal with every last one of you!

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.700
Just try not to get turned on, you rotten brats!

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.610
A bouquet for Irina's birthday?

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.250
Why me? She'd be happier to get it from you.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.500
Wow. Is he really that clueless?

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.640
Karasuma-sensei, if you consider that bitch a vital asset,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.470
wouldn't winning your colleague over be a big part of your job?

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.680
Oh, and don't tell her where it came from, okay?

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.060
You do have a point.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.980
All right, I'll do it. Thank you for your concern.

Bitch-sensei, we just remembered something we have to do.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.800
Sorry, maybe next time!
Huh? Wait—

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.350
Hey! Why's everyone leaving all of a sudden?

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.030
What is all this?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.200
I just don't get it.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.000
It's looped right back to being a lonely day again!

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.710
Hey, Karasuma, listen to this!

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.450
Those brats—

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.670
Nice timing, Irina.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.380
Karasuma?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.220
Happy birthday.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.580
No way...

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.350
From you?

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.190
Sorry I'm late. Things got busy.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.300
No, this is lovely. Thank you.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.870
This is really something, coming from you.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.410
You don't have anything else up your sleeve, right?

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.490
I do want to mark the occasion.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.460
This is probably our first and last birthday together.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.840
What do you mean, "our first and last"?

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.170
It stands to reason. Either we complete our mission, or the world ends.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.430
One of those two will happen.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.110
And either way, it'll all be over in under six months.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.200
Uh-oh.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.540
You caught us.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.520
I figured it was something like this.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.150
There's no way that stick-in-the-mud would come up with flowers on his own.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.950
Did you enjoy yourselves?

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.410
Stringing along a pro assassin? Watching her get her hopes up?

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.090
That's not it, Irina-sensei.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.380
The students acted out of pure goodwill to—

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.130
You're not convincing anybody, octorazzi!

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.470
How could I forget?

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.290
This is merely a business relationship.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.430
I've just been playing school with these brats in their peaceful world.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.170
You've opened my eyes.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.620
Thank you. It was the best present you could've given me.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.120
Hey—

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.540
Bitch-sensei!

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.130
Karasuma-sensei, wasn't that a little cold?

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.770
Don't tell us you still haven't noticed!

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.040
Do I really look that dense to you?

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.690
Huh?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.870
You may think I'm heartless, but if she can't keep her cool,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.640
I'll simply hire another assassin.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.510
If her blade can be blunted by matters of romance, she's not qualified to work here at all.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.680
That's all there is to it.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.210
Karasuma-sensei...

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.940
Argh, dammit! That pisses me off!

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.760
That Kara—no, Crapsuma! That Crapsuma!

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.190
Ugh, it's so hard to say!

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.700
But perhaps the time has come.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:41.120
I doubt I'll be able to score any kills here with my current skillset.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.570
Bitch-sensei hasn't come to school since.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.740
Day three, huh?

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.180
Maybe we went too far.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.850
Call me if anything happens with Irina-sensei.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.800
I've got to get to Brazil to take in a soccer match!

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.320
Samba-bye!

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.400
That's right. He'd had his mind set on attending the final today for a while now.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.320
Korosensei's Weak Point #28:
Not quite sure what "our brand of soccer" is

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.040
He's your typical once-every-four-years bandwagoner.
Pressing forward with the player's own power!

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.320
Most of the time, he's a baseball fan.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.070
I wonder if Bitch-sensei is okay.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.830
No good. I can't get through.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:25.330
There's no sign of her via GPS tracking or public surveillance cameras.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.040
She wouldn't leave over something like this, would she?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.880
That's not it.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.090
She still has a job to do.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.590
Yeah. It's fun having her around.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.860
Yes, you've bonded nicely, you and her.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.840
My preliminary research has already verified that much.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.420
All I'll do is exploit that.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.530
It was so casual,

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.180
the way this man just insinuated himself into our classroom.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.240
I'm the assassin known as the Reaper.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.860
And now I have a lesson for you all.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.920

Assassination Classroom Second Season Shiota Nagisa

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.140
What the...

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.020
This guy...

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:28.770
A flower's beauty negates human caution and opens the heart.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.480
Just like I told you and the others, Nagisa-kun.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:38.000
But the original reason flowers evolved to be lovely and fragrant—

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.370
Ritsu-san, bring up the image I sent you—

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.750
was to attract insects.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.670
Bitch-sensei!

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.210
I'll cut to the chase.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.630
If you want to keep her alive,

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.630
you must all come to the location I will specify—

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.090
and not a word to your teachers.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:06.740
You don't have to if you don't want to. I can send her to you.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.000
I'll make sure you each receive an equally-sized piece.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.400
And my next flower

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.360
will likely be one of you.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.320
I can't bring myself to be wary of him.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.340
That's when I first realized

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.330
what doesn't inspire fear should be feared the most.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.000
Hey, now, buddy...

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:35.410
We have no real obligation to save that bossy bitch. Plus...

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.640
Did you think we wouldn't just give you a beatdown right here,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.010
you kidnapper?

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.670
That's incorrect, Terasaka-kun. Wrong on all counts.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.940
You all like her more than you think.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.190
And a human could never cut down the Reaper.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.030
Fear not. It's just the Reaper going about his harvest.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:14.790
"Come as a class to the location on the map by six o'clock tonight."

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.950
This is just like with Takaoka and Shiro.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.880
That guy must be looking to take us hostage and draw out Korosensei.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.550
Dammit!

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.630
We usin' these?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.980
It's to protect someone... right?

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.000
World's greatest assassin or not,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.340
we won't let his plans go off without a hitch!

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.820
Is that the way in?

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.150
I did a loop-around from above. No sign of anyone in the area.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.960
Pretty ominous... Ritsu, if we're not back by midnight,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.160
tell Korosensei what's going on.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.380
I will. Stay safe, everyone.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.370
Let's go!

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.540
Big space he's got here.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.320
That all of you?

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.610
Okay, then. I'm closing it up.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.070
Hmm. So you can tell what we're up to.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.040
Reaper? More like Peeper, if you ask me.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.070
We kept our end of the bargain.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.040
Just give back Bitch-sensei and it'll all be over!

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.930
Wh-What the?!

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.960
The whole room... is going down?

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.130
Trapping complete!

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:56.480
Doing it all at once like this keeps the risk to a minimum.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.810
Bitch-sensei!

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.650
Dammit!

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.320
It's all right. If he comes quietly, no one gets killed.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.390
You won't snap and start killing us if we resist?

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:14.080
Of course not. You're a little too scared, even for a kid.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.080
Actually, I'm a little relieved.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.580
Here! It sounds hollow here!

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.000
A shaped charge!

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.460
Smoke-screen capsules!

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.600
Oh?

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.050
Right! Now you're talking!

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.020
Now for the moment of truth.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.020
Can you hear me, E Class?

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.510
The truth is, I'm very pleased you escaped.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.280
It'll be a fine warm-up before I head into uncharted territory.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.610
I expect great things from you.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.660
It's like... a game.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.110
This is different to Takaoka-sensei's simple vindictiveness.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.480
We can't see the Reaper's true face.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.720
Hmm... Seven to one.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.720
Test Questions Test Questions Test Questions

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:19.100
Yes, a seven-to-one ratio of X to Y gives us a lovely math problem.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:22.310
Test Questions Seven to one, seven to one... There.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.310
Note: Germany defeated Brazil 7-1 in the 2014 FIFA World Cup semi-finals

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.310
Mineirão... Sete a um...

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.290
Hey, big guy!

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.570
You lookin' for a fight?!

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.850
I-I seem to have angered the local residents!

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.090
Could there be any special circumstances?

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.990
Let me just ask Maehara-kun. He knows a lot about soccer.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.240
The party you have dialed is currently out of range, or—

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.330
Huh? Isogai-kun, then?

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.210
Hinata-san and Terasaka-kun won't pick up either.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.200
I've got a bad feeling about this.
It's a promising new star!

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.420
Our redeemer!

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.880
Let's intercept him here. No matter which direction he comes from,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.090
we'll have the upper hand if we outnumber him.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.090
Back us up, Ritsu.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:16:00.220
Don't feel like it. Not like I'm gonna defy the Reaperman.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.560
I'd sooner turn off than do any work.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.400
She's been hacked!

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.370
The Reaper...

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.450
Wha—

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:24.020
I can't make him out.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.500
This is the skill of an assassin!

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.280
That jerk!

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.960
He's just waltzin' right up!

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.680
The first skill I honed upon becoming an assassin

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.140
was head-on combat.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.840
It's ninety-nine percent unnecessary in this trade,

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.360
but without it, the remaining one percent of targets would get away.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.690
If you're looking to be the world's best assassin...

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.650
it's indispensable.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.200
Females are so very fragile.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.890
Can't be treating the rest of my hostages so carelessly.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.600
Move aside, everyone.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.120
I'll take him.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.540
Nagisa-kun...

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.840
That sound was the frame of her super P.E. clothes absorbing the impact.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.970
The Reaper thought it was her ribs breaking.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.340
He thinks that's what has me so furious.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.820
But I am angry.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.070
My anger will quell my bloodlust and avenge us all.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.620
I just need to bring my hands together!

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:32.730
Huh?

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.700
Uh-oh. We're no match for him.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.280
The clap stunner. For you and Lovro, it's simple misdirection.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.800
But there's a whole other level to that skill.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.160
Human consciousness has a wavelength:

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.020
the higher the peaks, the more sensitive one is to stimulation.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.780
So when your foe's consciousness is at its most sensitive,

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.880
you strike with your most powerful sound wave.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.970
That impact won't just momentarily startle your opponent.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.240
It'll paralyze their nerves, immobilizing them for a while.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.500
So this is what the world's greatest can do.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.380
Well, I wasn't expecting much.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.380
Now, then.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.460
Second Unit: Irina Rescue Squad
We seem to be short some people.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.660
Bitch-sensei!

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.840
She's breathing!

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.760
Take care of Bitch-sensei.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.890
Why do I get stuck with all the shitty jobs?

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.810
Okay, let's rendezvous with the rest and get out of here!

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.340
Got it!

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.770
Tell you what, though,

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.640
I'm glad Bitch-sensei's all right.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.530
Right?

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.220
Bitch... sensei?

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.270
I've been asleep for almost six months.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.040
But now my eyes are open, thanks to him.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.950
Time to put you out of commission.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.000
Bitch-sensei... Are you serious?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.780
Time for your final lesson, you brats.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.390
Ow!

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.810
I stepped on a rock barefoot!

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.220
Sheesh. You oka—

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:36.800
N-No fair... Acting like you were hurt...

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.550
We were worried about you for... a...

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.690
Such is our experience gap, my little hatchlings.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.280
I've seen far more than you: love and war alike.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.700
What's this? You beat them all by yourself?

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.970
It's just like you said:

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.210
it's worthless to throw in with these children.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.900
Exactly. We're from a whole different world.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.210
While these children were breathing clear air,

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.150
we've been filling our lungs with the smell of gushing blood.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.490
And what will you do?

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.860
Come quietly, or fight a hopeless battle?

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.770
Heh. Bring it on.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.180
Let's go, Itona. Between the two of us, we'll clobber this clown!

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.200
I surrender.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.070
Huh?

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.160
He's on a whole different level to us.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.000
We have everything to lose by fighting him.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.080
Itona...

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.040
I've learned something.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.470
We can lose today.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.420
We'll wait for our chance. Until we can win.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.390
Nagisa...

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:44.680
I don't know how you're going to try killing Korosensei,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.180
but will it really all go according to plan?

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.550
No matter how poor my intel, I'll still get results.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.660
That's why I'm the world's best assassin.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.820
Karasuma?

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.840
How did he figure it out?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:07.170
The octopus said if there was ever a wall his students couldn't get over...

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.600
...then it'd be his turn.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.170
This way.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.140
This dog disguise gives me a natural way to track their scent!

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.130
What's natural about such an overgrown mutt?

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.350
The moon that floats in the night sky
yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.580
If you stretch out your hand, you can reach it
te wo nobaseba todoku no te wo nobaseba todoku no

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:52.980
I went to touch it: it was warm

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:57.190
sotto furete mita atatakakute And slowly drew me in

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.190
And slowly drew me in jinwari suikomareta
jinwari suikomareta

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:08.970
The multiplying footprints, the view from my window
fueteku ashiato mado kara miru keshiki mo

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:15.080
As I drifted along, expressionless
muhyoujou ni nagare nagara muhyoujou ni nagare nagara

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.510
They spilled out of my hands ryoute kara koborete yuku
ryoute kara koborete yuku

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:26.430
It was rocking, swaying... I never knew
yurayura yureteta shirazu ni ita

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:31.930
Until I touched it with my own hands
kono te de furete miru made kono te de furete miru made

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:37.310
I want to gather up and go through all of the things
kaketa tsuki no shita chirabatta mono

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:44.700
Scattered beneath the waning moon
hiroiatsumete tashikametai sono subete wo
