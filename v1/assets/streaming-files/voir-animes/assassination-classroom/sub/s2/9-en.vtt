Everyone was starting to find their own answers.

What? So you do want to see more skin?

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.400
No... Hiding it actually made you more sexy!

So you're looking to become a bureaucrat?

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.660
Working behind-the-scenes in running the country...

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.230
That's rather restrained for you, Karma-kun.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.120
You know how the politicians were all useless during the last quake?

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.820
I can't deny that.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.460
But the country wasn't paralyzed. In fact, it kept functioning remarkably well.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.800
The bureaucrats pulling strings in the shadows must be pretty great.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.600
So that's what I want to be.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.560
Got a problem?

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.270
No. I agree that it fits you perfectly.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.480
Terasaka, you should be a politician.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.230
Huh?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.530
A big-mouthed, impulsive fool like you on the ticket?

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.950
It'd be a cinch to control you from the wings.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.950
Control me from the wings? You've been watching too many movies, man.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.580
Still, a politician? Where'd that come from?

Nakamura-san, you want to be a diplomat?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.630
I never would've thought you'd have such an earnest goal!

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.880
That's totally rude!

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.390
Believe it or not, they used to call me the grade-school genius.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.290
I aced all the sixth-grade tests as early as first grade,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.600
and I always came in at the top of the class!

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.340
But I liked being normal more. I wanted to be normal.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.280
I wanted to get lousy scores and joke about them with my friends.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.680
I managed to get into Kunugigaoka and played dumb

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.850
until I wasn't playing anymore.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.910
When I saw my parents' disappointed tears,

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.940
I finally began to realize the importance of what I'd lost.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.020
But I still wanted to do dumb stuff with everyone else, too.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.780

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.690

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.160
I got the car I'm driving right now from a guy who insisted I keep it.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.490
She's not used to buying off the rack.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.270
Should we tell her?

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.580
I'll get it.
Wow!

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:16.670
But that car was a war trophy I won by coming on to a young tech CEO for intel.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.630
Well, it's not a bad car, so I've been driving it,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.470
but Karasuma was all, "you obtained that car by fraudulent means!"

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.160
Last but not least!

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.720
So what's your chosen career, Nagisa-kun?

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.730
Sensei, I... I think...

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.140
I think I have a talent for killing people.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.700
I'd say I could probably get to the Reaper's level one day, too.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.400
For someone with no real strengths like me,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.860
that talent is the best thing I could hope for going forward.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.640
Korosensei... Should I...

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.540
Should I become an assassin?

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.630
Please... Tell me what path I should follow.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.150
You're a sensible student.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.680
You must have considered the risk and absurdity of becoming an assassin before asking me this question.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.780
Nagisa-kun, there can be no doubt that you have a gift for assassination.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.700
Whether facing a fearsome monster, a violent teacher, or a prodigious assassin,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.990
you have the courage to attack without fear.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.990
For a master killer, that's an indispensable skill.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.520
But, Nagisa-kun...

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.130
This courage of yours is fraught with desperation.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.050
You're taking your own safety and dignity too lightly.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.850
"It hardly matters what happens to someone like me."

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.560
To what end should you use your talents?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.230
And for whom?

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.500
Re-examine these questions. Then we'll talk again.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.330
And if you still want to be an assassin,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.760
I'll support you with everything I have.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.160
Whoa, you beat it? Even the secret boss?!

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.790
Not on my first playthrough.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.660
But I managed to beat him on the second round.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.560

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.060
Just please, let me stay where I am for junior—

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.470
Uh-oh.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.860
I talked back when she was in a dark mood.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.840
This isn't good.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.570
Here it comes.
Ow!

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.960
Watch your mouth! How could I have raised such an unambitious child?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.230
Don't you know that your failures now will haunt you your entire life?

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.580
I certainly do!

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.490
Why can't you understand your own mother, who only wants to spare you that same pain?!

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.000
Here I was, prepared to make a donation to cover for your bad grades!

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.760
See what your mother does for you?! Just who do you think you are?!

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.760
There's no talking to her when she's like this.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.640
It was my mistake for not speaking up when she was still sunny.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.220
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.190
Dad hates fighting. He got fed up and walked out.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.190
Now listen.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.010
You're just a child,

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.580
so how would you understand how to make your way through life?

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.660
But your mom knows all about it!

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.510
I have an ideal plan to make sure you don't wind up like me and your father.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.220
Like getting into Keisetsu University.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.610
The top school Mom couldn't pass the entrance exam for.
Choose a school: Keisetsu University

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.670
Big companies have colleges they favor,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.720
so your career success depends on your alma mater.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.160
You'll join Hishimaru Corp, where all the executives are Keisetsu grads,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.400
The famous company Mom couldn't get hired into.
Choose a company: Hishimaru
and you'll travel the globe for work!

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.990
Oh, and while I'm talking ideals... I so wanted a girl.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.650
She's said that a lot, too.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.610
My parents were all about the studying. Girlishness came second.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.150
That's why I never made it into Hishimaru, with their emphasis on personal appearance.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:10.010
And that's why I'd teach my daughter all the fashion I could.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.010
See how nice it looks with your long hair?

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.080
I don't want to hear it. I'm not a girl.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.900
Her tenacity was chilling.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.330
I'd likely never be able to defy her.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.520
Korosensei saw right through me. I'm not the hero of my own life.

I'll be coming in tomorrow to ask the E Class teacher for a transfer.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.700
Huh?

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.800
Th-That's pretty sudden. He might be busy.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.010
It's for your own good, Nagisa.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.040
Say your goodbyes to the E Class tomorrow.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.590
She's gone dark again.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.810
Nothing I can say will do any good.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.850
I see. So your mother's coming to discuss a class transfer?

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.590
What now? Nothing can change her mind once she's determined.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.020
Karasuma-sensei's out on business,

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.180
and I can't ask his underlings to step in on his behalf.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.110
Most of all, I don't want to leave the E Class.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.170
Don't worry about a thing.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.880
I'm a super-organism capable of destroying the Earth.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.700
Parent-and-child meetings are no problem!

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.920
I-I don't know about this.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.920
Assassination Classroom Second Season Shiota Nagisa

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.440
Your mom, huh? She's a tough cookie.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.180
Korosensei said to let him handle it, but...

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.800
I could pretend to be your teacher.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.430
Huh?

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.790
No.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.400
On paper, Karasuma-sensei is our teacher.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.690
If our parents talk, it won't add up.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.160
Oh.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.270
It's really quite simple.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.770
I'd just need to become Karasuma Tadaomi.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:02.990
Korosensei?

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.450
It's me! Me! Y'know, Karasuma!

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.160
What a shoddy dupe!

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.540
What's with the scribbling between the eyebrows?

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.080
I'm accentuatin' Karasuma's standoffish nature!

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.120
Spittin' image, right?

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.480
And why do your arms look like sausages?

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.210
Those're Karasuma's bulgin' muscles!

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.130
Quit obsessing over the most pointless details!

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.310
I was uneasy, but all I could do was pray.
At least put on a nose and ears!

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.220
Yeah, add a nose and lose the fake drawl!
Pray that Korosensei would be able to convince my mother...

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.460
to let me stay in the E Class.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.320
Is that Nagisa's... She's really pretty!

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.310
But she does look tough.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.080
Nice to meet you.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.000
I'm Shiota Nagisa's mother.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.080
Please, have a seat. You too, Nagisa-kun.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.950
It's quite a trip, all the way here to the mountains.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.120
How about something cold to drink?

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.080
I-I guess that'll do.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.350
You know, you're really quite beautiful, ma'am.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.040
I see Nagisa-kun takes after you.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.840
This one here...

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.720
If he were a girl, I would have brought him up to be my ideal.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.220
Your ideal?

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:12.700
Yes... A girl this age looks best with long hair.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.440
I was only allowed to have short hair as a child, you see.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.300
I got mad when he started tying it back for school this year,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.120
but it does look pretty good on him, so I let it slide.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.130
Oh, yes. Future plans.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:32.200
In my experience, children cannot be allowed to lose ambition at this age.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.650
Kunugigaoka High is one of the best in Tokyo in terms of Kei U acceptances.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.760
Being kicked out after junior high

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.950
will hurt both his college chances and his career.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.890
So I'd like your help in getting him out of the E Class.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.390
Have you spoken with Nagisa-kun about this?

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.680
He doesn't understand anything yet.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.400
It's only natural for a parent who's tasted failure to set their child's path to avoid it.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.230
Mom?
I—

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.400
You hush now, Nagisa, okay?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.580
I see.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.690
I understand why Nagisa-kun came to be who he is today.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.540
A wi—

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.040
Yes.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.750
I, Karasuma Tadaomi, wear a wig!

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.150
Hairstyles, high schools, and colleges

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.160
are not for a parent to decide.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.180
Nagisa-kun must decide for himself.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.390
Ma'am,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.850
Nagisa-kun's life is his to live.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.640
He's not a tool for hiding your own complexes.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.360
As his teacher, let me be very clear:

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.040
unless Nagisa-kun wishes it,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.280
I will not permit him to leave the E Class.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.700
What's your deal?! What teacher talks to a parent like that?

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.910
How dare you insult me!

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.000
You think you're so great that you can nitpick my education plan?!

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.000
Yikes!

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.210
I won't stand to be lectured by a moron teaching morons out in the mountains!

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.450
Holy crap!

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.210
Nagisa's mom is pissed!

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.590
Nagisa! So all your acts of defiance lately

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.920
are because this bald bugger suckered you in?!

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.010
Well, watch this!

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.720
I'll open your eyes, all right—as far as they'll go!

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.640
Korosensei...

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.500
Hmm. I was a bit more forceful than I'd planned.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.750
But still...

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.990
What's most important is that you make your own intentions perfectly clear.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.300
But right now, since I'm powerless on my own,

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.120
maybe I should just be Mom's round two.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.720
I wouldn't say you're powerless at all.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.370
As long as you have the urge to kill, you can do anything.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.590
You began the first round of your own life right here in this classroom.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.240
My... My first round...

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.140
Looks good.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.600
Sorry for blowing up in front of your teacher today, Nagisa.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.480
I'm just so invested in you.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.560
Uh-huh.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.320
And, well, I've been thinking.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.100
Huh?

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:10.320
I've decided I will allow no further interference with my life.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.110
I'll remove the obstacles.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.740
I'll give you a new outlook on life...

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.740
Nagisa.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.720
School...

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.160
Mom?

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.400
You went crazy after you were sent down here.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.320
Started disobeying me.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.280
What—

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.650
Burn it. Burn down the school— with your own hands.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.400
What are you saying, Mom?

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.690
If you light the fire yourself,

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.720
you'll feel too guilty to ever show your face to anyone here again.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.380
With your escape route cut off,

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.700
we'll go ask a teacher from the main campus to take you.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.120
N-No, I don't want to!

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.080
Who do you think raised you?!

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.090
Sent you to cram schools? To a private junior high?

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:07.130
Do you have any idea how much time and money you've cost me?!

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.540
Every night, exhausted from work, I still made dinner for you!

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.460
You have no idea how I've suffered!

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.050
That clueless cueball brainwashed you! He turned you against me!

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:20.670
I'm the one who made you! Everything you are!

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.860
She's wrong. But she's also right.

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:28.650
How can I express this feeling?

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.370
First, you must make your own intentions perfectly clear.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.030
Mom... I—

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.000
Quit your screeching, you old bag.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.830
It's almost time for the show.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.170
Wh-Who are you? Get out of my way!
That bloodlust... He's an assassin!

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.670
You're the ones in my way.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:59.140
He comes every Wednesday at ten to watch TV dramas with the autonomous artillery.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.510
As he approaches, I'll kill him with my whip,

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.450
splitting his head wide open at the speed of sound.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.890
You'll kill him?

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.960
What?

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.200
P-Police!

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.300
If I kill the kid, the bounty goes up in smoke...

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.620
but they don't much care if I kill his old lady.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:25.190
Mom's afraid. The assassin's let his guard down.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.040
Mom, a life spent watching for your reactions

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.840
has cultivated a talent within me.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.260
It may not be the talent you wanted me to have...

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:42.260
but it's that talent that lets me be of use to everyone here.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:47.480
You began the first round of your own life right here in this classroom.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:54.190
Mom, I'm putting everything I have into this class now.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.740
And by the time I graduate, I'll get results.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.450
If I succeed, I'll cut my hair...

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.620
and pay back all the money you spent to raise me.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.120
If you still can't forgive me...

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.830
What's this?

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.030
Then I'll graduate from you, too.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.430
Mom...

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.390
I'm so, so grateful to you just for giving me life and raising me.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.280
It might be asking a bit much,

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:36.020
but if you could just be happy that your child was born in this world and grew up fairly okay,

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.160
everything would be tied up in a neat little bow.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.830
Wh-Who are you? What have you done, Nagisa?

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.560
Some undesirables have made this their hangout,

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.920
so I recommend staying away at night.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.650
Korosensei...

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:59.020
You just swore fair and square you'd kill me before March. No backsies!

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.260
Urgh... I know.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.790
Now then, ma'am... Yes, Nagisa-kun is still immature.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.890
But please, watch over him warmly.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.120
He is not trying to betray you.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.970
He's just getting ready to leave the nest, as everyone must.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.820
Pulling away... from me? Nagisa?

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.780
Mom!

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.110
It seems she fainted once the adrenalin wore off.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.070
I'll take you back in her car.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.510
So, Nagisa-kun... If you did manage to kill me,

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.180
would you go on to use your talent to become an assassin?

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.680
Probably not.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.220
Talent isn't just for one specific thing.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.390
Even if my talent is good for assassination,

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:58.110
I want to use it to help people— like how I protected Mom.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.780
And I won't do that by being an assassin.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.570
Way too dangerous, for one thing.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.860
I'll find a career that won't worry my folks.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.370
Take your time.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.590
Oh, and don't forget to make an effort to talk with your parents.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.500
I won't.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.840
Sheesh, cars are so slow, and you have to wait for lights!

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.050
How inconvenient can one mode of transportation get?

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.760
Korosensei's Weak Point #30:
Easily susceptible to road rage

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.900
What's this?

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.430
I'll make breakfast from now on,

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.190
so you can take it easy before work.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.490
yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte
The moon that floats in the night sky

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.460
I'll take out the garbage and stuff, too,

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.900
and I'll get into a high school just as good as Kunugigaoka High!

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:45.720
te wo nobaseba todoku no te wo nobaseba todoku no
If you stretch out your hand, you can reach it

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.700
So please, let me stay in this class!

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:51.890
sotto furete mita atatakakute
I went to touch it: it was warm

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.700
Do what you want. I don't care.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:56.330
jinwari suikomareta jinwari suikomareta
And slowly drew me in And slowly drew me in

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.790
I am an assassin—

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:08.110
fueteku ashiato mado kara miru keshiki mo
The multiplying footprints, the view from my window

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.120
holding my head high till graduation!

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.220
As I drifted along, expressionless
muhyoujou ni nagare nagara muhyoujou ni nagare nagara

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:18.650
They spilled out of my hands ryoute kara koborete yuku
ryoute kara koborete yuku

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:25.570
It was rocking, swaying... I never knew
yurayura yureteta shirazu ni ita

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:31.070
Until I touched it with my own hands
kono te de furete miru made kono te de furete miru made

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:36.450
I want to gather up and go through all of the things
kaketa tsuki no shita chirabatta mono

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:43.840
Scattered beneath the waning moon
