00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.890
Stop it, Kayano!

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.350
This isn't right!

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.520
All I'm doing... is killing him.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.150
Once I put my mind to something, I just keep on rolling!

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.200
Kayano... isn't acting? These are her true feelings?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.220
She's only been fighting like this for ten or fifteen seconds,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.120
but the tentacles are already starting to take over her mind.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.980
If they've already taken that much control, it's too late.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.940
Whether or not she gets her revenge,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.950
she'll only last a few more minutes after that.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.960
Then I think she'll die.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.070
Kayano-san... Die! Die! Die!

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.760
Die! Die! Die!
Korosensei...

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.790
Kill me...

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.600
Help me!

00:00:42.890 --> 00:02:12.940

Die! Die! Die!

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.950
Looks more like she's gonna die... any minute now.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.880
Can't we do anything?

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.380
Do we just stand by and watch her get eaten away?

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.520
Class!
Whoa!

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.760
Korosensei?!

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.160
Why just your face?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.680
It's an afterimage!

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.050
Kayano-san's ferocious attacks don't leave me much time to spare,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.170
so leaving an image of my face is about the best I can manage!

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.850
Still, that's pretty nifty.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.810
We have to remove her tentacles ASAP!

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.190
Die!
They're only giving off all that abnormal heat

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.690
because she's not putting any thought into her own survival!

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.530
At this rate, the tentacles will suck out all her life force, and she'll die!

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.770
However! As long as her bloodlust matches that of the tentacles,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.700
they'll stay rooted to her nerves, impossible to remove!

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.210
We don't have the time to talk her down like we did with Itona-kun!

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.170
Then what can we do?

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.170
There's only one way:

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.280
I'll pull them out as we fight.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.290
I'll let her attack my most critical weak point:

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.310
my heart, located just under my tie.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.850
Its complete destruction would kill even me.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.240
If I can make her think she did me in,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.310
her tentacles' bloodlust will weaken for a moment—if only a little.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.760
And in that moment, one of you

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.780
will have to make Kayano-san forget her bloodlust.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.990
Forget it? But how?

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.450
Whatever works. Anything to get her mind off assassination.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.870
It's the only thing I can't do.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.910
If the target of her bloodlust were to try any funny business,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.070
it would only fan the flames.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.820
But if you can quell that bloodlust,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.000
the tentacles' bond with her will momentarily be broken,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.260
and I might be able to remove them with minimal damage!

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.470
And Kayano's tentacles will be stuck through your heart the whole time?

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.440
Won't you die first?

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.440
I'll try to avoid being fatally wounded.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.020
But I'd say the odds of me dying first are about fifty-fifty.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.090
No!

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.310
But you know...

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.650
Having you all graduate safely is worth more to me than my life.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.330
H-How are they supposed to step into the fray and distract Kaede?

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.790
Does he want those brats to pull off some kind of parlor trick?

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.100
Mimura... Hmm?

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.300
Play some air guitar.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.890
Huh?

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.810
Show her your mad skills.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.470
She'll turn her bloodlust on me!

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.580
Look, just do it!

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.430
There's no way that'll work!

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.310
Then what do we do?
The clap stunner?

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.240
No. If her brainwaves are as messed up as they look,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.780
a single clap stunner won't be able to take effect at the ideal moment.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.100
Knives... Guns...

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.860
All this stuff would just hurt Kayano.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.660
Isn't there anything else?

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.950
The techniques we mastered in this classroom—

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.330
we learned anything and everything we needed to become expert assassins!

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.710
Wait. There is that one killer move.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.710
Die! Die! Die!

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.740
I got him!

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.760
I swore to your sister... Let me go!

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.770
that I wouldn't give up on any of you.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.610
Nagisa...

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.140
Nagisa-kun...

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.180
I can't let you say it, Kayano.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.680
That it was all an act.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.370
Our memories here... The fun times we all had together...

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.850
I can't let you say that the only thing on your mind through all that was revenge.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.830
Korosensei?

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.670
Is this enough?

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.630
Full marks, Nagisa-kun!

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.630
I can remove them now!

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.020
Does this mean Kayano-san will be all right?

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.750
Most likely, yes.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.900
Though she'll need complete rest for a while.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.940
Hey, Prince Charming!

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.640
Shutting her down with a kiss, eh? Nice!

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.910
I thought it'd be the best way to make her forget her bloodlust.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.070
I'll apologize to her later.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.030
Fifteen hits on a ten-second kiss?

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.160
You've got a long way to go.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.120
"Hits"?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.250
After all the training I've given you through my forceful, indiscriminate French kisses,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.360
you should have been able to make at least forty.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.670
Well, I could do twenty-five easily.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.290
Same.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.690
God, I hate this place.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.970
Though I could make it to twenty or so myself.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.890
Korosensei!

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:46.000
I'm fine. It'll just take a while to recover since I got hit in the heart.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.150
Now, I know you're dying to hear all about my backstory,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.690
but please, wait just a little longer.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.710
Don't get all dramatic about dying, now.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.410
You're still alive enough to dodge.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:01.780
Shiro...

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.910
Useless girl.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.340
If she was willing to give her own life for that revenge plan of hers,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.920
you'd think she could have done a bit better than this.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.920
You're quite the monster.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.890
Just how many assassins have you driven away in a single year?

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.060
But there are still two of them right here before you.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.990
I'll be your final opponent.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.950
You took everything away from me...

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.530
and I'll make you pay for it with your life.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.560
The genius scientist, concealed by a cloak and voice modifier...

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.030
So it is you, Yanagisawa.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.130
Let us go, 2.0.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.820
Come March, his accursed life will meet a perfectly fitting end.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.640
What's with him?

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.760
I...

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.860
Kayano-san... Thank goodness.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.000
Kayano, are you okay?

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.820
Uh-huh...

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.100
Kayanocchi...

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.010
At the start, it was pure bloodlust that drove me.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.830
But as I spent time with Korosensei,

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.120
the conviction that fueled it began to waver.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:32.400
I started to wonder if there was more to his background. Circumstances I didn't know about.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.300
And if so, I thought I should find out what they are before I kill him.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.930
But by that time, the bloodlust in my tentacles had swelled forth.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.170
They wouldn't let me back down.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.200
I'm such an idiot, right?

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.480
You were all genuinely enjoying your assassinations,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.290
while I wasted the whole year on plain old revenge.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.830
Kayano...

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.010
Once you showed me this hairstyle,

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.910
I stopped fretting about my long hair.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.580
And like you said,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.000
you coined the name "Korosensei"— and we liked it enough to use it all year.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.820
It doesn't matter what your motives were.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.280
You're one of the people who've made this classroom what it is.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.350
No matter how much you suffered on your own,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.980
we can't let you say it was all an act—

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.980
My Plan (Secret)

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.770
not all those days you spent smiling right there with us.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.720
Korosensei promised to tell us everything once we were all together.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.050
He's not a saint.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.510
We know he doesn't always do the right thing.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.530
But let's hear him out. All of us, together.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:47.660
Yeah.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.090
Thank you. Now I don't have to act anymore.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.570
Korosensei...

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.780
Whatever's in your past... We'll accept it, as long as it's the truth.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:15.080
To be honest, I was hoping to never talk about my past if I could avoid it.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.500
But I see I have no choice.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:25.300
I don't want to lose your trust— the bond we all share.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.640
This past summer, on that tropical island,

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.820
Karasuma-sensei said of Irina-sensei:

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.670
"The better the assassin, the broader her skill set."

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.990
I think that's relevant here.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.950
You, the E Class, are the first students I've ever taught.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:49.350
Even so, I've managed to teach you just about every subject without a hitch.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.770
Why do you think that is?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.690
Don't tell me... That's right.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:02.150
Until two years ago, I was the assassin known as the Reaper.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.700
And one more thing...

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.180
Even if you do nothing, I'll still die come March.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.120
Either I die alone, or the Earth dies with me—

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.900
that's the only part of the future an assassination can change.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.090
And so, the super-organism began to speak

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.540
of the human memories he had hidden away.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.940

Assassination Classroom Final Season Kayano Kaede

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.920
He grew up trusting only in death.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.470
Born in the ugly world of the slums,

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.820
the only truth he could rely on even as a child

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.000
was that if you killed someone, they were gone for good.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.340
So he chose the path of the assassin.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.220
It was his calling.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.490
The mighty, he killed with knowledge.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.960
The intelligent, he killed with strength and skill.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.080
Those gifted with both, he enticed with his own charisma.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.900
Once he had claimed a thousand victims,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.010
he was given the nickname "The Reaper."

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.240
Watch how you handle him.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.210
Assume there's always a danger of him killing you, no matter the situation.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.150
Though this is a pretty sad state for any assassin to be in.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.830
Clear-headed and tough-bodied.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.840
No family registry means no one will complain if he dies.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:53.450
He's perfect for this experiment— which is exactly why we got him.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.460
Listen up, guinea pig.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.610
Once, you were the legendary assassin, "The Reaper."

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.360
But now you'll be our experimental subject from dawn to dusk, every single day.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.430
Wow, that's a surprise!

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.390
I wasn't expecting such a kind-looking person!

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.640
Someone pressed into service as my monitor, eh?

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.860
Right? I won't do anything, so could you get me out of here?

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.820
No can do. If I'm killed, that's it, y'know?

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.280
This woman...

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.900
I might just be able to use her.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.720
But there's one thing that's bothering me...

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.860
What's with that shirt?!

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:04.020
80% Full 80% Full I'm Yukimura Aguri. Nice to meet you!

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.590
80% Full 80% Full

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.090
ATPase, rebalance phase...

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.240
Give him forty units of SOD inhibitor.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.050
Yes, sir.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.960
They're wide open...

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.680
but if I kill them now, it'll just complicate my escape.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.030
Good job today.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.920
Let me know once you've rested a bit, and I'll check your vitals.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.250
Again with the dorky shirts, Yukimura-san?

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.990
N-Not this one, too?!

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.220
I thought it'd be a breath of fresh air in your solitary lifestyle!

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.090
To be honest, it ticks me off.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.810
And I like this brand, too.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.060
Well, they don't go over well with my students, either.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.660
Students?

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.020
Aguri!

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.650
Just how long does a simple data check take?!

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:07.320
I-I'm sorry, Koutarou-sa—

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:15.450
I'm only marrying you out of pity, since your father's one of our subcontractors!

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.420
Now, repay that kindness!

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.080
Follow my orders with utmost effort and whole-hearted devotion!

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.130
And as for you, my guinea pig...

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.300
See you tomorrow.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.200
Generating antimatter within life forms:

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.810
That was the core of Yanagisawa's research.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:48.380
He sought to incorporate antimatter-generating particle acceleration cycles into biomolecular networks

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.280
and activate the intracellular machinery through colossal energy.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.330
Yanagisawa?

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.200
Hmm?

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.620
My hands and feet are pretty numb.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.610
And I'm getting chills.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.140
That's Yanagisawa-san to you!

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.510
Tch. Peripheral neuropathy, eh?

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.730
Perhaps we should stop administering the alkaloid?

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:13.950
Yeah. If it starts affecting polymerization of macromolecules, this'll all be for nothing.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.220
If I can skillfully manipulate the experiment myself,

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.650
I can boost the probability of success even further.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.780
I'll gain powers of destruction beyond all human reckoning.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.690
Wow, so much on my checklist today!

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.800
Better hurry it along or I'll get smacked around again.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.950
And I guess you don't want that, huh?

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.400
Yeah, basically.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.860
I'm actually a teacher, so I can't be getting stupid, now.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.210
A teacher?

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.480
Aguri!

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.600
How many times do I have to tell you? Don't keep me waiting!

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.250
I'm sorry! I'll do it right now!

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.240
Your physical ability and clerical skills are all you're good for!

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.920
Can't you observe one lousy guinea pig?!

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.420
Maybe I'll have to beat it into—

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.140
Mr. Reaper... What did you do?

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.930
I've immobilized him. That's all.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.610
Now you can still teach tomorrow, right?

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.440
After he had spent about three months in this place,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.340
the killer and the teacher were as open with each other as old friends.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.500
Quadratic equations?

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.060
You have to dress it up a little more, or it'll feel too easy.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.000
That goes double for students at a college-prep school.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:34.550
The equation x² - kx + (3√3 - 9)/2 = 0, which is quadratic in x, has two roots, and their difference is (5√3 - 2)/2. Find the value of k.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.550
Urgh... The professional teacher, being schooled by an assassin...

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.380
You're better suited to be a teacher than I am, Mr. Reaper.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.150
Well, I can play a college professor if work demands it.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.850
But I'm not cut out for teaching.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.340
I had a pupil once... but he betrayed me.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.210
That's how I wound up here.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.940
Now the Reaper's name and all his skills are mine alone.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.790
And that's not all.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.050
I recently mastered a disguise technique that even you don't have.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.540
Farewell, my teacher.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.800
You never did see my face, did you?

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.980
I still don't understand.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.960
I had developed his abilities and supervised him almost perfectly, and yet...

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.270
I think I get it.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:34.190
Your student probably just wanted to be seen. By you.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.150
But I did see him.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.100
Closely observing someone's abilities and personality is key to winning them over.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.560
Break time's over, guinea pig.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.220
Get back on the restraint table. We're doing more testing.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.040
The subject's body is starting to undergo strange changes.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.220
Given the enormous energy within, if he were to rebel...

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.560
If he's planning on making a run for it, he'll take Aguri hostage.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.180
Huh?

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:12.170
She's a docile and reasonably capable specimen whose death no one would mourn.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.930
In other words, a canary to gauge his malice.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.120
Rejection response is within expectations.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.170
You may leave him be.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.280
She was to be a living sacrifice.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.040
The Reaper was turning into something that wasn't human.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.100
And though she sensed these things...

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.060
she was not the type to ask unnecessary questions.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.530
Good job again today.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.660
Once you've rested a bit, I'll check your vitals.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.300
Then we can talk, like always.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:15.400
She just looks straight ahead and smiles peacefully. Like always.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:22.400
Oh... So this is what "seeing" is.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.130
Yes, let's.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:37.350
komorebi ga yasashiku sashikomu ookina mado no naka
As the dappled sunlight shone gently through the window

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.500
How are those exam questions coming?

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.500
The legendary killer who'd never shown himself to anyone

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.820
knew for the first time the happiness in being seen.
I-I'd like your opinion on a few of them.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:47.610
kimi to deatta ano hi wo tooku ni kanjita
The day I met you felt so far away

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.820
The seasons changed yet again.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:49.780
Her new batch of students met as Class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High...

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:58.850
sukoshi zutsu narabeta omoi ga boku wo atatameru
The memories I've arranged little by little keep me warm

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:57.960
two weeks before the crescent moon came to be.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:21:59.920


00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:11.870
chiisana heya tsunagu kokoro sotto oshiete kureta
A small room, hearts connecting: you taught me gently

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:24.660
kono kisetsu ga mukae ni kitara kimi no sugata mou sagasu koto mo
Once this season comes for me, I won't be able

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.900
dekinaku nacchaun da ne dekinaku nacchaun da ne
To seek you out anymore, will I?

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:35.540
zutto wasurezu ni iru yo zutto wasurezu ni iru yo
But I'll hold your memory in my heart

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:41.520
mata kimi ni aeru hi made mata kimi ni aeru hi made
Until the day I can see you again
