00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.870
The target is gone, and the Earth is saved.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.250
Thank you for all your hard work this past year.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.490
I imagine there are some things you'll find hard to swallow.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.820
You'll have all eyes on you for a while, I'm afraid,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.660
and I'm sure they'll be asking you to keep quiet about confidential matters.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.930
I'll do my utmost to protect you, of course,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.380
but allow me to apologize in advance.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.820
It's all good, Karasuma-sensei.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.440
We'll do our best to get this settled peacefully, too.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.990
We don't want to complicate things for you either.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.520
But in return, we do have one request.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.740
Please let us attend Kunugigaoka's graduation ceremony today.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.720
Our days spent battling with the main campus

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.190
are yet another precious memory we made with Korosensei.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.690
Sure, I'll arrange it. After all, that's why I'm here.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.210
All students, please rise!

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.470
Karasuma-sensei, Bitch-sensei, thank you both for everything you've taught us!

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.580
Thank you!

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.570
So where is graduation, anyway?

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.300
School's locked up tight. Looks like it's at the civic center.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.060
We'll need our folks to bring by our uniforms.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.600
There must still be some lingering sadness, and yet...

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.780
How strong they've become.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.080
They're almost unrecognizable compared to a year ago.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:03:11.000

Kunugigaoka Junior High Graduation Ceremony

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.880
Korosensei never said anything about the E-Class system being wrong

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.120
or about us trying to change it.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.470
Kurahashi Hinano.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.150
Sir!

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.010
This world is full of unfair things by nature.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.440
If you have the time to be resentful and resigned to that...

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.440
Shiota Nagisa!

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.260
Sir!

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.580
Kunugigaoka Junior High Graduation Ceremony

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.520
...wouldn't it be more fun to spend it trying to change things?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.110
He taught us plenty of ways to do just that.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.080
You have a much sharper look in your eyes these days.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.800
The fruit of your teacher's instruction, I'm sure.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.810
Thank you. And you can take yours down a notch...

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.220
But please do take care!

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.930
That was a nice ceremony, wasn't it?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.120
I was really moved!

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.730
Right?
Huh?!

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.660
Mom, Dad... Why are you here together?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.160
At the end of last month,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.850
that monster—your teacher—paid me a visit.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.410
Nagisa-kun asked me a favor at the very start:

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.340
he wanted to be called by his first name, not his last.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.170
That way, he said, he won't have to readjust in class

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.620
if he goes back to using his father's name.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.980
He's a fine, respectable young man.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.270
He's likely to meet his major goal in March.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.780
Please give him your blessing—as a family.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.480
Both he and your mother told me how hard you worked

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.660
and how determined you were in making it this far.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.160
Your father and I have talked it over.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.280
We'll follow your example and work hard to give us another try.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.340
Huh?

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.080
Just how many life-changing legacies did our teacher need to leave behind?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.880
The ceremony's over!

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.230
It's interview time!

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.600
E Class, a word?

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.060
This place is off limits!

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.560
Tell us about the monster!

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.310
How do you feel right now?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.320
Did you really kill him?

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.780
Hey, buddy, outta the way!

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.300
You vultures! Spare a thought for the students' feelings for once!

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.990
Who cares?!

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.420
Outside, everyone! Quickly!

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.960
There's a bus waiting outside the main gate!

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.540
Hey!
Ow!

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.880
What the—?!

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.170
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.980
Quit meddling with our coverage!

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.560
You quit meddling with our moment in the sun!

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.390
After a little editing, I might just release this online!

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.750
We know what you look like!

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.070
Now, let us escort you to the front gate.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.480
For many of us, our ties and our relationship end today,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.010
but we are still students who studied at the same school.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.370
To abandon you now would bring shame upon me as your ruler.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.880
Akabane?

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.870
Seems you're the only one staying on.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.470
Once all this blows over, I'll have you grilled until you spill the beans.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.920
You'll tell me about this Korosensei guy who managed to make you all who you are.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.100
Sure, I don't mind.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.120
It might have a hard time getting through that stodgy old skull of yours, though.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.000
C'mon, you're the last one.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.690
Whoa!

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.610
Off you go.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.380
A day like today, with so many reasons for tears...

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.820
I doubt I'll see another like it.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.340
The clear blue sky Good-bye, Kunugigaoka Junior High.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.800
Good-bye, Class 3-E.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:53.180
The same as on that day Good-bye...

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.010
Ah, up here on this hill Korosensei.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.080
Farewells come around

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.820
The vapor trails that hold our hopes

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.760
Lots of stuff happened after that.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.970
Rise up high, shining white
Kunugigaoka Academy came under fire for putting its students in harm's way.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.930
Keep Out No Trespassing Keep Out No Trespassing

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:15.010
Keep Out No Trespassing The cherry blossoms Keep Out

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.600
No Trespassing Keep Out No Trespassing Keep Out

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.640
No Trespassing Keep Out No Trespassing

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.980
The E-Class system was also seen as problematic and was abolished.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:25.730
Keep Out No Trespassing Keep Out No Trespassing

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.600
Keep Out No Trespassing Bloom now, full and proud
After we left, the E-Class campus closed its doors for good.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.410
The principal had to relinquish his administrative powers.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:38.130
Our time Our school, growing distant now

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.360
But I got the feeling he had accounted for that already.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:43.920
Both our bitter memories and our joy

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.870
He was a man of tough convictions and prodigious wit,

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.180
and I'm sure he found another job in education soon after.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:51.530
Were in that classroom Can we help, Asano-sensei?

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:56.580
Parting time Ah, Nagai-kun and Mori-san!

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.940
Our youth may be incomplete How many years has it been?

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.200
We heard things were really rough.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.780
Both for you and for the students who came after us.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.270
But our dazzling days will be

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.880
Is there anything we can do?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:16.700
In our diploma

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.380
We'd be glad to give something back to our mentor.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.710
Well, let's see.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.530
Can I ask you one favor, then?

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:30.920
I close my eyes and see them, so vivid

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:29.250
Will you celebrate this new start for me and your juniors?

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.740
Come, let's drink.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:38.120
Ah, the precious pain and kindness

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.360
We'll talk about what you're doing now,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.950
and I'll air out my complaints.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.220
We'll listen to anything you have to say.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.240
Coming back to me All three of us.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:48.240
We laid out our dreams on those desks

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.810
The thirty-billion-yen bounty...

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.340
And we'll think of them many, many times

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.020
was promptly paid out.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.140
Karasuma-sensei said it was also hush money of a sort.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:10:02.880
The cherry blossoms Bloom now, full and proud

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.740
We talked it over,

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.120
referring to Korosensei's book of advice.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.070
The accomplishment's the thing!

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.860
Our time

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.400
You can't grow up right if you live your life relying on piles of money!

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.210
The last bell rings out And so...

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.680
we each took some for our education and a down payment for living on our own,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:23.000
A message written on the blackboard and in our hearts

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.640
donated here and there to various places,

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.680
and finally made one big-ticket purchase together.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.720
"I'm sure we'll meet again"

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.980
The rest we returned to the government in thanks for their year of support.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.090
Parting time

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:38.060
Karasuma-sensei—I mean, Karasuma-san's reputation is sure to rise.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:39.570
We're overcome with emotions

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:48.120
Both this bright light and the heartbreak will simply be

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.140
The moon began to crumble, slowly but surely.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.370
Under its own gravity, it would eventually end up a much smaller sphere than before.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:55.200
In our diploma

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.720
The explosion had also brought it closer to Earth,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.770
so after a while, its size, shape, gravity, and orbit

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:04.700
would start to look and feel very similar to how it was before its destruction.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.950
The crescent moon that symbolized our year together

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.290
would slowly forget its shape.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.950

There's been some dangerous movement from an organization that incites violence in the Middle East.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.090
The plan is for each country to send in a secret agent to infiltrate their group.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.620
You'll head there tomorrow, Irina.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.000
Okay, sure...

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.240
But I'm scared, Chief Karasuma.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.270
If a gorgeous woman like me was captured in dangerous territory, could you imagine?

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.300
Or does it turn you on?

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.780
Picturing your wife having all kinds of things done to her...

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.670
I asked you to go because I had faith in your abilities.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.210
But if that's really how you see yourself...

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.170
Then I have no choice. I'll ask someone else.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.050
Huh? But—

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.460
I was joking! I just wanted you to show a little concern!

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.010
Come on, sweetie!

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.680
So you're going?

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.970
I'm going!

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.600
Then go get ready!

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.980
Yes, sir! Gladly!

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.480
It's been seven years since we met...

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.530
and she hasn't changed a bit.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.860
I wonder if our students—

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:55.830
or should I say, his students too—are doing all right?

Hey-hey, Miss TV Drama Actress!

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.940
Hi, everyone!

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.190
Kaede-chan, are you in costume?

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.280
Are you sure you're not too busy?

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.160
I sneaked out on a break.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.240
I can't always let the rest of you do all the work.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.620
All right!

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.610
Okay, folks! Let's start polishing up this place!

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.080
Yeah! Let's do it!

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.200
Once class president, always class president!

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.720
Well, you all practically forced me to hold on to the key!

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.090
This kind of stuff's always been best left to you.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.530
Hey, are you done reading "Korosensei's Rules to Live By"?

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.780
Nowhere near! It never ends.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.350
People have been leaving their trash around here again.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.240
And we even bought the mountain and everything.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.060
It's okay. When there's a mess, we clean it up—

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.000
that's one of the rules on this campus.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.240
But man, you sure have hit the big time, Kayano-chan.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.210
Well, geez...

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.170
She's got the looks, she can handle action,

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.130
and she can dive off a thirty-meter cliff with a smile.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.120
It'd be weirder if she weren't so big.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.800
No, no... I'm just relying on stuff I learned during junior high.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.350
And, Okajima-kun, quit the low-angle shots and get to work.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.020
We agreed that we didn't need a grave.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.940
After all...

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.560
it didn't feel like they were gone.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.360
This school is where the two of them are now—

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.470
a place we'll always return to.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:05.420
We should think about putting this place to some use, not just preserving it.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.000
You know, before we get too busy with job-hunting.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.550
Okano's using the other side of the mountain.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.380
She formed an acrobatic performance squad at her sports college.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.520
Said this was the training field she's most used to.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.730
We'll run the circuit! Follow me!

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.190
Hup! Hup! C'mon! Faster!

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.780
Whoa... And Kurahashi's giving nature tours to kids.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.380
She's always had her ways of earning a little extra allowance.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.370
Okay, this way! Watch your step!

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.330
Okay!

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.460
We've all grown up just how Korosensei taught us.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.010
Look at Manami-chan and Takebayashi-kun—

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:53.790
taking hints from the cell activation protocol in their guidebooks,

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:58.150
they're developing an artificial blood that can be transfused regardless of blood type.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.190
This has the potential to save hundreds of millions of lives!

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.360
Okuda-san did the bulk of the development.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.650
I'd like to take it into the clinical realm myself.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.610
We call it "Rh slither blood."

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.670
Sugino-kun's become a college baseball ace.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.380
Strike three! Batter out!

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:27.980
Yes!

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.800
His versatile pitching has even caught the eye of pro scouts.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.080
It slithers and curves even more than rumored!

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.180
That Slithery Sugino is a tough one!

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:42.890
Terasaka-kun's strength and guts have been recognized by a certain politician.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.820
Hey! We'll be late for the lecture!

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.110
Are you a man or a mouse, boy?

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:52.400
That old fart, workin' his student to the bone!

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.610
Maybe he'll start as a personal assistant once he's out of college.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.030
Yoshida Yoshida Motors Motors
Yoshida-kun and Muramatsu-kun are taking over their family businesses.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.310
Listen to that purr! Ain't it great?

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.750
I guess, yeah!

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.790
Shourai-ken Ramen Gyoza Check this out, Takuya!

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.680
Bet it's tasty!

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.260
What?! How do you expect to make any profit using such fancy ingredients, ya dummy?!

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.220
Itona-kun went to his family's factory straight out of high school.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.510
If I have any problems on the management side,

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.800
I'll get Yoshida-kun and Muramatsu to help.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.930
And that's his plan.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.900
Ritsu's made a home for herself online.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.860
Now that I'm doing parallel processing with computers around the world,

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.180
I can even make songs and draw pictures!

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:42.020
Now she's helping out her former 3-E classmates with more emotions than ever before.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.960
We've all been stretching ourselves as needed,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.290
steadily deciding our paths in life.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.630
Oh, you hear about Karma?

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.970
I heard he passed the management-track national civil service exam like it was nothing.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.490
Good luck finding flaws in that guy.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.240
The hard part comes after, though.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.640
I hear bureaucracy is really stressful work.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.680
All the bullying during the interviews and the training

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.110
really tests how you stand up to stress.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.070
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Huh...

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.340
So this is where I'll make my money, eh?

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:25.220
But I'm sure he'll be fine.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.750
Wait!

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:38.930
Okajima... Yikes!

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.720
You haven't changed at all, have you?!

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.680
Looks like you haven't either!

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:43.680


00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:56.680
komorebi ga yasashiku sashikomu ookina mado no naka
As the dappled sunlight shone gently through the window

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.460
No matter which path we chose,

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.660
Korosensei probably would have smiled and said the same thing:

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.770
"It suits you."

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:06.940
kimi to deatta ano hi wo tooku ni kanjita
The day I met you felt so far away

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:03.130
We learned so many different kinds of life from him in just one year.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:11.740
And even now... they live on inside us.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:18.180
sukoshi zutsu narabeta omoide wa boku wo atatameru
The memories I've arranged little by little keep me warm

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.220
The life named "pride"...

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:31.200
chiisana heya tsunagu kokoro sotto oshiete kureta
A small room, hearts connecting: you taught me gently

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.150
Listen, I don't have ten times the estimate!

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.180
You said you'd leave it all up to my artistic sense!

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.460
The life we share...

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.150
How about we visit that park over there today?

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:43.990
kono kisetsu ga mukae ni kitara kimi no sugata mou sagasu koto mo
Once this season comes for me, I won't be able

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.540
The life we're given...

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.070
Isn't Euler's polyhedral formula so, like, the coolest thing ever?

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.050
The life we want to raise someday.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.650
I hope we can continue to carry them on—
dekinaku nacchaun da ne dekinaku nacchaun da ne
To seek you out anymore, will I?

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:54.770
dakedo bokura wa warau yo dakedo bokura wa warau yo
But we won't lose our smiles

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.260
the lessons from scrambling for life in a classroom swirling with bloodlust.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:20:01.170
mata kimi ni aitai kara mata kimi ni aitai kara
Because I want to see you again

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.790
This classroom is our greatest memento of Korosensei.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:08.970
And I know there's someone I'd like to see using it one day.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:22.630
So, Kayano-chan, what's up with Nagisa-kun? Are you two in touch?

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.910
Well...

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.870
I'm... not really on his radar right now.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:33.330
You know him. He's one assassin who always has his eyes on his target.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.540
Hello, everybody!

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:40.040
I'm Shiota Nagisa, the student teacher in charge of this class.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.400
Seven years have passed.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.590
I've grown way taller and become a teacher loved by all.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.560
If only.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.060
Huh? A student teacher?

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.210
You're shittin' me!

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.230
Hey, that's a girl!

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.940
Let's pull down her pants and make sure!

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.570
C'mon, you're still in junior high, ain'tcha?

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.900
Why me?

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.120
How could I have not grown the tiniest bit since junior high?!

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.120
7 Years Later 7 Years Later

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.960
Everyone else shot right up!
Hey, sis!
Look how much I've grown!

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.980
And Karma's over six feet tall! Give me a break!

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.620
And this hell is where I wind up for my teacher's traineeship.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:23.860
The power dynamic is the polar opposite of our assassination classroom!

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.540
Do you know what kind of place this high school even is?

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.510
If you don't wanna wind up in the hospital, better make this period study hall.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.690
Th-The bell's rung, so take your seats, class.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.620
"Take youw sheetsh, cwassh."

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.720
You don't get to boss us around. Try it, and we'll kill you.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.460
Eh?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.920
Kill?

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.630
Kill, huh?

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.700
A commonplace word,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.930
one that anyone will have heard.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.970
But for us, it's a magic word that gives us courage.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.410
I do hope you can kill me—

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.390
before graduation, that is.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.370
Now, take your seats,

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.960
and let's begin.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.930
