00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.860
The math exam's final problem.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.970
Half of our grade couldn't even make it this far.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.710
The other half had arrived in the nick of time,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.410
already short of the energy needed to solve it all the way.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.930
The only ones capable of getting full marks in the time remaining...

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.180
were these two.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.620
What was it that Nagisa-kun always used to say?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.280
Aw... How can two fellow humans have such a gap between them?

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.060
I guess your talent's on a whole different level, Karma-kun.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.040
Easy for you to say.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.000
If you ask me, I'm not sure which of us is the real genius here.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.040
What we call "talent" is the part of us that others can't see.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.820
Like Sugino, who can slide right in with people.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.030
Or Okuda-san, who can totally lose herself in something she loves.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.690
Or Terasaka, who can act without giving it a single thought.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.820
From where I stand, those are all talents.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.660
Everyone has their own area of talent that I can't see,

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.740
so in that sense, we're all the same.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.460
The issue here is whether I can see this problem with my own talent.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.460
Oh, man. I definitely won't have enough time for this.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.280
Atoms, body-centered cubic units...

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.010
I can't let these unnecessary details throw me off.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.620
Once I get down to the essentials, it's painfully simple.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.250
Find the volume of your own domain here in this box, surrounded by enemies.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.250
When both sides are evenly matched,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.710
their attacks meet in the middle.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.090
So from there inward is my domain!

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.930
Gotcha. You won't be breaching my domain any time soon.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.750
Eight enemies surround the inside of this cube.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.030
So if I find the volume of the eight areas I've sealed off

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.190
and subtract it from the cube, I'm left with...

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.420
A[0], my domain!

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.620
Once I lock down this space, I'll have the correct answer!

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.130
Really, what fits me better than becoming ruler of my own domain?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.100
A different kind of ruler than my father, mind.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.490
Right now, he's obsessed with proving that his own "rational education" is correct.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.980
It may break a person, but it will not educate them.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.110
I'll set him straight and give him a piece of my mind!

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.360
To take control—

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.450
that is my duty as a son!

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.500
There it is!

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.040
The volume of one of the sealed-off areas is an aggregate of one hexagonal and three triangular pyramids!

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.370
Hang on...

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.580
This doesn't call for any tough math at all!

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.260
It's separated out into this one little cube,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.610
but if this is an atomic crystal,

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.570
there'll be more of the same structure outside this cube too.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.030
Which means...

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.180
the world doesn't end here!

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.880
So from where I stand, everyone has their own talent and their own domain,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.550
and it's the same from where they stand.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.810
All I could see from inside the box were mere fragments of everyone.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.520
Just as I claim my own domain, everyone else will claim theirs.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.080
We're all the same size, the same distance apart.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.990
To occupy a given box this way,

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.990
each of us must be broken up equally into eight boxes,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.740
so each person's fragment accounts for one-eighth.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:45.460
The box holds a whole me and one-eighth each from eight people's fragments.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.920
In other words, inside this cube,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.980
the ratio of me to the other eight has to be one-to-one.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.560
And if it's one-to-one inside the box,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.150
the volume of the domain I can claim is up to half the cube!

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.210
Well, geez... This is primary-school stuff!

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.460
No need for drawn-out calculations or complex diagrams.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.360
If you just realize the fact that there's a world outside yourself...

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.850
Time's up!

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.390
Pencils down, Asano-kun.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.110
One more line...

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.970
Dammit! I knew the answer!

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.180
And so the surging tide of our end-of-term exams receded at last.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.000
Now then, class,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.110
I'll be returning your papers—an evaluation of your growth.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.670
Did your second blades manage to reach their targets?

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.410
No grumbling about a point here or there, now.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.560
We had only one goal going into it:

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.060
for all of you to do well enough to get into the top fifty overall.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.500
The main campus will be posting the overall ranks right about now,

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.820
so let's unveil them here in the E Class too.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.460
I-I...

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.420
I'm 46th?!

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.230
Isn't Terasaka dead last in the E Class?

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.740
If Terasaka-kun came in 46th... Then that means...

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.770
We did it!

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.110
We pulled down the Big Five in the battle for top spot, too—practically a perfect win!

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.520
And first place is Karma for once!

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.800
How does it feel, Karma-kun?

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.320
To go after that first-place rank on such a high-level battleground... and win?

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.790
Um, whatever, I guess.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.220
It seems your battle against the perfection-boasting Asano-kun

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.450
came down to that final math problem.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.290
About that...

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.710
I'm not sure exactly why,

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.490
but I don't think I could've solved it if I hadn't spent this year with you all.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.490
That's the kind of problem it was.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.000
It sure was a slog getting to this point, though, huh?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.160
Our most fervent wish—besides a successful assassination, anyway!

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.980
We really did beat the A Class!

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.270
We can go to our first-pick schools!

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.410
Girls will be throwing themselves at us!

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.980
Go, us!

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.410
Yay! Girls everywhere!

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.640
Feels like a final episode to me.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.450
Hey! It can't end yet!

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.230
You feeling okay, Takebayashi?

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.410
Yeah, it's just...

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.820
So much happened since I dropped down to the E Class,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.130
but I'm glad I stayed.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.340
Aw, why so glum, chum?

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.120
Weird as heck comin' from you!
Yeah, leave the ugly mugs to Terasaka.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:16.720
Say what?!

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.470
Terasaka, you're choking him!

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:19.960
Well?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.040
I think I can get into my dream school with this.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.680
You want to be an architect, right?

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.620
Yeah. That's why I want a high school that's big on the sciences.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.430
Boy, those A-class twerps must be white as sheets right about now!

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.530
I bet they never thought they'd lose to us!

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.930
For their part, the A Class did well on the first half of the exams.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.880
But it seems more and more students got hung up on the tougher problems in the second batch of subjects.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.580
Well, sure. You can't keep your bloodlust going for that long.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.420
Even with daily assassination training,

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.800
it's rough staying in that frame of mind for a whole day.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.560
If you want to enhance your performance with bloodlust, cramming won't work.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.640
You have to nurture it slowly but surely over time.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.480
How? How could we lose after all we went through?

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.740
With your study program, there's no way you could have won.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.260
That's all it comes down to.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.550
Though the scores I earned are nothing to brag about either.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.770
I'll make good use of this frustration, that's for damn sure.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.760
Even in high school, I'll keep winning,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.390
and I'll be looking for ways to let you win as well.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.990
So please...

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.800
lend me your support in turn.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.170
Asano... Asano-kun...

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.720
Could you still say that

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.860
even after a battle on which you bet your life?

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.260
Principal Asano, sir!

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.090
Life is always a great unknown.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.630
Will losing a battle mean losing your life as well?

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.970
You never know until the battle's over.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.340
That's why you all need to keep on winning.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.180
I have an obligation to teach you as much.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.400
I'll improve your mindset by graduation time, mark my words.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.690
Principal Asano?

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.840
It's clear to us now.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.220
With these current methods, we can't beat the E Class.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.770
The E Class and Asano-kun—both grew stronger through defeat.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.560
Our strength is no match for the resilience they have.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.070
We apologize for falling short of our goal.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.530
If you wish, you may send us down to the E Class.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.910
I have the feeling we can learn and grow more there.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.130
You have your answer, sir.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.380
Asano-kun!

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.420
Asano-kun!

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.300
That look on your face, like you're glitching out...

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.520
I might just be seeing your fatherly side at long last.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.950
I'm fine.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.580
If you'll excuse us, sir.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.330
All right, students,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.670
you've formally received your qualifications to move out of the E Class.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.670
So is anyone looking to leave this mountain?

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.800
Of course not!

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.850
We found our second blades! This is when it gets serious!

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.700
What other environment is this suited to assassination?

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.140
Gluttons for punishment, eh?

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.650
Then for your reward, I'll tell you my crucial weakn—

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.490
The school building!

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.340
Prepare to vacate the premises.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.220
Principal Asano!

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.670
The board came to a decision this morning.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.030
We're tearing down this old campus building today.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.220
I'll have you move to the new campus of our affiliate school opening next school year.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.720
You will help us performance-test the building until your graduation.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.890
A-A new campus?!

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:39.400
With surveillance and anti-escape systems drawn from correctional facilities,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.420
one can study in a more polished environment akin to a prison.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.320
The new E Class: the culmination of my educational theories.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.700
B-But moving us now?

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.330
No way! We wanna graduate from this campus!

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.590
You'll carry out your educational vision to the very end, won't you?

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.410
Indeed.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.500
But make no mistake: you are no longer useful to my education.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.900
Therefore, this...

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.300
is where I kill you.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.060
K-Korosensei's dismissal notice?!

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.980
He actually went there! He played his forbidden ace in the hole!

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.690
Th-That's wrongful dismissal!

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.170
It works hilariously well on this octopus.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.110
I don't think a super-organism has any business staging a protest.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.630
And so that you don't jump to any conclusions,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.460
let me say that this is nothing but a tool to control my target.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.370
I have come, Korosensei,

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.120
to kill you once and for all.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.120
You are no longer necessary for my education, you see.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.460
Are you serious?

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.500
I know you're superhuman and all,

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.500
but our octopus won't go down quite as easily as you think.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:59.370
Hold off the demolition for now. I have some work to do inside.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.840
Where'd that notice of dismissal come from?

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.820
What could Principal Asano be thinking?

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.820
Now, then, Korosensei... If you want to keep your job—

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.530
if you want to protect this classroom—

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.000
I'll have you join me in a little game of chance.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.620
A game of chance?

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.510
I've prepared test review workbooks across five subjects as well as five hand grenades.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.520
Four of them are anti-teacher grenades. One is effective on humans.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.940
They're the real deal.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.730
They are identical in appearance and smell,

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.400
and made such that, once their pins are pulled,

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.640
they'll explode the moment their handles begin to rise.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.060
I shall now pull their pins

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:51.280
and place them carefully between random pages in the workbooks, handles in place.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.640
You will open the book and solve whatever problem is written in the top right.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.870
As soon as he opens it, the handle will pop up, and—

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.680
Yes. He will almost certainly be hit with an explosion.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.810
But until he solves the problem, he may not move an inch.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:13.560
You'll handle the first four books, while I'll take the last one.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.400
If you manage to kill me or force me to withdraw,

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.520
I will permit you and the E Class to remain here.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.810
Let's see... Ah, Terasaka-kun.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.900
Use a formula to determine Korosensei's odds of winning.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.230
An anti-teacher grenade explosion won't kill you,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:43.150
so to do that, we'd need to avoid the real grenade until the end.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:52.010
4/5 times 3/4 times 2/3 times 1/2 equals 1/5. Twenty percent.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.210
Correct!

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:58.040
But the octopus has to take four deadly grenades in a row,

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.770
while you can just tap out soon as it gets ugly.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.980
That's messed up! It's totally unfair!

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.180
Terasaka-kun.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.000
In time, you'll find that the world is simply one injustice after another.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.590
Especially between the weak and the strong.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.510
That's why I've taught you to be the strong ones.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.210
So will you give it a try?

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:25.180
This is also a test of how serious you are about your chosen profession.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:29.670
If I were you, I'd jump right in.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.840
Of course. Let's do it.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.740
He threatens dismissal and concocts a game of chance that's clearly in his favor.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.960
But there's no backing down.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.140
Mathematically, it has better odds than any of our other attempts.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.240
To be one of the strong—that is the mightiest blade.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.980
Truly, this is the principal's assassination!

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.920
Open, solve, and close—do it all in one motion, and it won't explode.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.020
With your speed, it may even be easy.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.660
Y-Yes, of co—of course!

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.000
Plane figure calculations!

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.080
Um, well, that's an easy one! It's, you know, that thing,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:36.320
where you borrow from the tens to get 3 with 4 left over, or, say, about 3 or so—

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.650
Seeing you struggle with that metal ring puzzle,

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.700
I noted how your reaction and thinking speeds drop when you're flustered.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.600
You'll never overcome this trap.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.960
Korosensei...

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:57.130
First one is a hit. Make it through three more and you win.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.470
Now, solve the next, before you have time to recover.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.820
You're kiddin' me! He can't take three more of those!

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.520
Is he really gonna fall to such a simple trick?

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.660
The weak can only kill the strong through assassination,

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.220
but the strong can kill the weak whenever and however they like.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.360
I will pepper the nation with mechanisms to teach this truth.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.210
With my money from the Ministry of Defense and the bounty from killing you,

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.290
I can build my affiliate schools all over the country.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.250
It's always about education with him.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.780
Now, Korosensei,

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:43.000
become the foundation on which I will lay my philosophy.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.180
Surprise!

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.850
Teach Us, Kunudon!

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.500
Phew! That school festival was a real white-knuckler,

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.920
but it looks like the E Class is finally down for the count!

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.280
Show's over!

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.160
What a bunch of loser garbage!

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.120
Serves you right!

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.960
Oh!

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.650
Mr. Principal, sir, what brings you here?

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.340
Notice of dismissal!

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.740
I'm... going to the E Class?!

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.930
Jobless forever! Yay!
