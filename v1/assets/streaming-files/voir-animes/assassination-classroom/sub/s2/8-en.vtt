00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.270
I'm betting... he means to lure me in and then kill me.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.650
Well, shucks.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.750
That sure throws a wrench into my plans.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.240
Korosensei and Karasuma-sensei!

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.790
He came all the way from Brazil?

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.630
Oh, well. Plan 16 it is.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.400
My time to shine.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.560
Wh-What is this?!

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.940
The whole room is lowering!

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.270

8th Period Terasaka Ryouma Reaper Time, Part 2

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.060
Not you too, Irina-sensei...

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.840
You're the one behind all this?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.050
Does the name "the Reaper" mean anything to you?

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.350
Lovro mentioned it once before.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.760
I let him live on purpose.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.640
If I want my competitors to leave the game,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.020
I need him to spread the word about me.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.090
Hey, how about lowering that gun?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.960
Or are you trying to shoot your friend?

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.110
The way he obscures his presence...

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.510
I've put explosives on her neck and the students'.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.040
They'll detonate on my signal.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.130
You think threatening hostages means I'll just roll over and die for you?

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.330
Why don't we find out?

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.090
I don't sense anyone else around.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.760
If I'm just careful with his guns...

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.770
But why?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.530
H-He can see my tentacles?!

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.450
Korosensei!

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.200
Sir!

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.450
Are you okay?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.580
That was disappointingly quick.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.660
I didn't even have to use the hostages.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.350
Let's go say goodbye.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.070
Irina-sensei... Sensei!

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.340
Class... Is everyone unhurt?

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.930
I can't believe he captured you too.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.390
A cage made of anti-teacher material, eh?

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.270
It's tricky stuff, to be sure...

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.600
but my body has finally overcome it!

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.020
Really?!

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.240
Now to reveal to you... my secret biological weapon!

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.280
I formed this tongue with a coating of digestive juices.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.870
Give me half a day, and I can lick these bars away.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.160
Too slow!

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.670
Say...

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.040
Keep licking like that, and I'll detonate everyone's neckbombs.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.550
What? Aw!

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.300
Now, then. Better hurry.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.260
I'm about to flood this place with water.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.520
This is a drainage canal.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.180
I just have to give the command from the control room up above,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.710
and two hundred tons of water per second will squeeze you into spaghetti against these bars.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.470
Wait! You intend to kill the students too?

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.120
Of course. Now that he's here, I can't wait a moment longer.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.670
Irina! You knew as much, and yet...

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.680
As a pro, I just prioritized results. That's all.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.210
Isn't that what you wanted?

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.080
True, it may be a little harsh...

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.160
but is that reason to let our best chance of saving the world slip away before our eyes?

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.480
Say an opportunity arises where we can kill him, but only in exchange for the students' lives.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.210
What is the government's policy on such a situation?

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.980
Well, that's, uh... You'd handle that on a case-by-case basis.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.690
In the very real possibility of it coming down to that, you'd, uh...

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.100
J-Just make that decision at the scene.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.070
So in other words, it's my responsibility.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.590
Then my decision also becomes...

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.890
Here's how the government sees it.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.450
The lives of twenty-seven people weigh more than the Earth.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.000
If you still plan on killing them,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.590
I'll stop you.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.140
Karasuma-sensei!

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.310
S-So cool!

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.680
And I'll tell you this, Irina.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.600
Being a pro isn't quite so simple.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.150
If it takes too long to kill Karasuma, my plans will come apart.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.620
And so...

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.160
I don't think so!

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.520
Karasuma-sensei!

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.450
Turn on your transceiver!

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.880
Hmph. How rash.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.240
Karasuma may stand apart from others...

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.160
but he goes even further.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.280
Just look at how easily he trapped that octopus.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.220
Bitch-sensei...

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.850
Irina, I need your help.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.810
I've set a trap.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.550
While Karasuma's fiddling with it,

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.700
shoot him from behind.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.600
Understood.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.490
The other side of this doorknob feels wrong. A trap?

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.980
No time to disarm it.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.700
Guess I'll just open it.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.290
Did that get him?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.710
At the very least, it'll slow him down.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.030
Tsk. More powerful than I'd expected.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.210
Your nose for bloodlust is spot on.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.120
I'll admit it: l underestimated you.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.790
It's like a trade fair for traps in here. Well done.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.330
Once you master the skills to kill a person,

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.170
it's in an assassin's nature to want to use every last one of them.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.920
Make sure you hit him, Irina.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.010
Sorry.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.970
This next one won't miss.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.930
You're going to die, Irina.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.110
I'm fully prepared for that.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.020
You probably can't understand, but he does.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.150
"You and I are the same," he said.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.650
That's right. Did I tell you my backstory?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.280
I was born in a poor slum beset by constant terrorist attacks—

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.330
an uncertain world where life could blink out in an instant.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.670
All I could trust in was money and my own skills—

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.460
and the fact that those I killed weren't coming back.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.860
And so Irina understands how I feel.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.820
Isn't that right, Irina? Even if I did use you as a sacrifice.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.940

Assassination Classroom Second Season Akabane Karma

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.030
You're alive!

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.070
I should have known.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.080
But you can't come after me.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.510
You know, I only hired her to deceive you all.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:30.920
Irina...

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.380
Well, time for the big finish.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.630
Wait!

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.720
Ka... ma... sei... Karasuma-sensei!

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.990
Are you all right?!

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.840
What is it?

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.880
I finally got through. What was that explosion?

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.060
I'm all right, but Irina's pinned under the debris.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.150
But there's no time. I'm going after the Reaper.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.800
You can't!

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.400
Why won't you help her, Karasuma-sensei?

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.660
Kurahashi...

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.890
Irina partnered with the Reaper to get results in her own way.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.040
A real pro accepts the consequences of her actions.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.550
What does being a pro have to do with it?

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.540
I know this is coming from a fifteen-year-old...

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.880
but Bitch-sensei is only twenty-one!

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.560
Growing up in an environment with no peace of mind,

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.480
she probably forgot to pick up some of the pieces along the way

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.440
that would've made her a grown-up.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.030
So please... rescue her, Karasuma-sensei.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.720
Just like how you forgive us students when we make mistakes.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.600
The village was wiped out.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.520
But this one killed a militia member and escaped.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.300
What do you think, dear?

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.840
Good eyes.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.430
You have a decision to make.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.390
If you live with us, breathing blood like air,

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.440
you can turn the gore which haunts your dreams into mere routine.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:20.200
You can seek peaceful days, forever living in fear of your bloody memories,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.610
or, rather than running from them, you can tame those memories through work.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.130
Too cruel a choice for a child, I suppose. Let's go to the refugee camp and...

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.960
There's no turning back.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.420
That's right.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.600
My everyday life was spent wading through a cold sea of blood.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.660
How fitting that I should die betrayed.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.180
I'm glad it could end...

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.300
before my new existence under the sun reminded me of the warmth of life.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.070
Get on out of there. I'll shoulder whatever burden you need me to.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.630
What's this?

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.250
They've all escaped!

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.180
No matter. I'll just kill a few to set an example and order the rest to stop.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.350
They took them off?!

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.510
Wow, they're good!

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.230
Damn.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.190
The bombs' remote has only a detonate command and an unlock function.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.360
They're so simple that we can just pull them off without them exploding,

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.010
and he'll never know.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.110
Th-This is rough.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.780
This protective coloring matches the walls, and the light quality is just right!

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.000
Just like you said, there's a spot the camera can't see properly!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.870
Then, with Sugaya's spray...

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.400
The assassination camo on our super P.E. clothes works great.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.780
We can make 'em perfectly wall-colored!

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.280
Sheesh...

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.840
Who knew the RC peeping squad would play such a big role?

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.240
What about Korosensei?

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.670
He's got his own camo built in.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.180
Which means he's buck naked right now.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.080
Now I can never get married!

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.060
Quit blushing or he'll see you!

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.740
Your left arm may be broken.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.380
Does it hurt anywhere else?

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.950
Hey, you're bleeding!

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.780
No... Your super-hot body just got me excited.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.940
I thought you might have brain damage,

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.040
but that's perfectly normal for you, huh?

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.590
He's back. Just as the students predicted.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.530
Irina, it may be different from the world you grew up in,

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:53.100
but the world in which the students and I live needs you.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.150
Irina, where's Karasuma?

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.880
He was already gone when I came to.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.570
That was awful of you, Reaper,

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.050
blowing me up with the rest.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.450
Yeah, sorry about that!

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.920
I wouldn't have been able to achieve my goal otherwise.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.810
After all, in this world, it's deceive or be deceived.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.390
Oh, I don't mind.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.760
After all, I'm a loose bitch who doesn't think twice about hopping from man to man.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.160
I-Is this guy nuts?

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.340
I've been thinking. Are you really all you're cracked up to be?

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.990
What was that?

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.000
Each individual skill of yours is on point,

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.500
but your endgame and defenses are weak.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.050
You sure told me.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.380
You...

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.110
I peeled off my face.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.770
It only stands in the way of improving my disguise skills.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.230
Now to kill you and take your face!

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.930
Hey, what's going on?

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.320
Um, er... The Reaper has a knife—no, a wire!

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.790
He uses that on Karasuma-sensei, who—oh, wow!

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.340
He dodges and counters with his elbow—no good! Eek!

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.440
He's using his knife as a shield, and seeing that,

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.310
he's switched to a kick, but at the same time...

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.920
All I can say is... what an amazing fight!

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.130
Korosensei's Weak Point #28:
Gives terrible play-by-plays

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.450
What the heck are you saying?!

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.460
Whaaa?!

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.130
Explain it so we can understand!

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.970
I dared to pull him into close-quarters combat,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.940
but I don't know what he's got up his sleeve. Can't let this drag on.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.350
I'll tell you the truth, Karasuma-sensei.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.390
I made up all that stuff about growing up in tragic circumstances.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.430
That was social engineering designed to pull the woman in.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.070
Why, you...

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.160
An assassin killed my father.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.240
I wasn't particularly broken up about it.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.540
But the way the killer moved as he was cut down before my eyes

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.380
made me think...

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.090
What a beautiful skill!

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.640
I was captivated.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.800
Assassination: an ensemble of beautiful skills!

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.560
And the essence of those skills I mastered?

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.430
Allow me to show you.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.570
The Reaper's hidden scythe.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.060
A mere .10 caliber.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:02.910
Its minute bullets pass between muscle and bone to tear a hole in the aorta.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.060
The aorta's own bloodstream pressure widens that hole...

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.460
until you die from major blood loss.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.920
A composite art that only the Reaper can pull off.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.700
What?!

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.750
Is this...

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.780
Finally, a definitive opening.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.630
Good to see even the Reaper has the same weak spots as any other man.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.280
Is that the octopus's... Tomato Juice

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.750
I can just about fit one tentacle through.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.960
You used juice as a decoy?

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.670
I hope you've prepared yourself, Reaper,

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.680
for what happens to those who dare lay a hand on my precious students and colleagues.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.090
Wait! Who else could kill him if not me?!

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.690
We have all the skills we need right here!

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.730
Why don't you quit the assassination scene?

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.640
I'm sure your skills will come in handy at the employment office.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.710
That man had incredible skills, but he put too much faith in them.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.010
Whoever shaped his growth was a fool.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.850
He could have put his skills to good use on the straight and narrow.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.720
Whether an individual is nurtured or corrupted...

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.920
It's all up to the people and the world around them.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.470
Yes, exactly.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.560
Right, Irina-sensei?

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.430
Urk!

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.290
You bitch!

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.190
What's the big idea, tryin' to run away?!

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.110
Eeek!

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.690
Ow!

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.820
Argh! Just do whatever you want!

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.200
The boys with their usual pent-up animal lust,

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.660
the girls with their usual envy of my beauty—

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.410
just let it all out in an explosion of sexual violence!

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.250
Her ideas are getting out of control!

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.250
Look, just come to school like always.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.090
No more shirkin' your duties for days on end.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.620
I'm dying to know more about that story!

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.600
Did you really swindle Arabian royalty and nearly start a war?

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.640
If you don't come back,

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.600
I'll just keep that French Boys Over Flowers manga you lent me!

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.320
I was this close to killing you all, you know.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.310
Is that a problem?

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.400
Backstabbing, treachery... Isn't that what makes you a bitch?

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.170
And if having one little bitch around ruined school for us,

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.780
what kind of junior-high assassins would we be?

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.680
That's right.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.270
I didn't get this flower from the students.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.130
I took it from my defeated enemy with my own two hands.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.080
Is that good enough for your birthday?

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.490
He hands it over so blandly! And there are way fewer flowers this time!

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.600
I'll give him a piece of my mind!

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.110
Now, what do you say at a time like this? Let's see here...

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.570
Yes.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.400
Ooh, they've got some real potential!

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.320
But I had dibs!

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.200
There, there.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.930
Karasuma-sensei, a word before things take a turn for the racy?

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.910
It definitely won't, but very well.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:37.660
I don't want the students to ever be involved in this kind of danger again.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:44.800
I must insist on an environment where we can safely kill and be killed.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:46.940
I know.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.600
"If any student should become collateral damage during an assassination,
Ministry of Defense Ministry of Defense

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.190
the bounty will not be paid." Hmm.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.480

Request Students of E Class Students of E Class

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.150
You've really grown fond of those kids, haven't you, Karasuma?

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.190
Surely the students have the right to their own safety.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.490
All right. I'll accept these conditions.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.700
Either way, we're done relying on individual freelance killers.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.290
An international coalition is moving forward

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.580

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.380
with the final assassination project.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.310
I don't know where this classroom is headed.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:40.160
yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte yozora ni oyogu tsuki datte
The moon that floats in the night sky

If you stretch out your hand, you can reach it

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.470
Your arm?

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:43.820
Fine.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:49.260
But I know that at this moment, it's in the right kind of world.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:51.560
sotto furete mita atatakakute

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:56.000
I went to touch it: it was warm And slowly drew me in

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.000
And slowly drew me in jinwari suikomareta

00:21:51.560 --> 00:22:54.140
jinwari suikomareta 

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:07.780
The multiplying footprints, the view from my window

As I drifted along, expressionless

It was rocking, swaying... I never knew

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:30.740
Until I touched it with my own hands
kono te de furete miru made kono te de furete miru made

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:36.120
I want to gather up and go through all of the things
