I... Letter of Acceptance Examinee No.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.190
Name: Shiota Nagisa
We hereby inform you that, due to a vacancy at the recent entrance
exams, you have been moved up the waitlist and accepted into our school.
Letter of Acceptance Examinee No.
I got in!

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.820
I'm finally past the worst of it.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.620
You all got in to one of your top two schools!

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.560
Congratulations!

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.580
Splendid job killing it with your first two blades alone!

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.450
Nice going!

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.500
You'll all move on to high school like the twinkling stars you are!

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.830
It's a weight off my shoulders, too!

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.270
We were supposed to start our final career counseling...

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.340
Hooray! You Made It!!
Congratulations!

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.340
but first there's something I'd really like to do.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.890
And what does one do, on such a joyous occasion?

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.270
Editing.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.270
What for?!

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.520
I'm making a yearbook, of course... just for the E Class!

00:00:46.980 --> 00:02:16.940

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.520
Making a yearbook?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.370
Yes!

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.350
Oh, right. We only did a whole-school one.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.750
With Karasuma-sensei as our teacher.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.710
And poor Korosensei wasn't in a single shot.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.670
Actually...

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.770
he bombed a few at Mach speed, just under the radar.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.890
It's like one of those ghost photos.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.850
Exactly! That's why I want to use these photos instead!

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.800
A year of unguarded moments!

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.190
These treasured selfies with all of you—

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.720
thirty thousand in all!

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.120
Now to find the most memorable ones together!

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.480
When did you take all these?!

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.280
That's our peeping teacher.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.120
I don't really like looking at pictures of myself.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.060
Why not?

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.610
My eyes are so tiny.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.760
Don't worry.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.540
I've made versions with the eye-enlargement filter too.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.920

Thank you for always being so considerate.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.730
The official one is full of the same pictures you'd see in any yearbook.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.130
If we're making our own, we can be more unconventional!

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.800
Leave it to me!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.080
Cool beauty Hayami-san at the pet shop...

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.180
Oh, and here's a nighttime campus shot of Mimura on air guitar!

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.690
H-He was behind us all along?

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.730
I'm just getting started!

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.480
Princess Kataoka, trying on her royal vestments, but no further!

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.000
Dainty Muramatsu, right when a cockroach scurried out!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.910
Naked Okajima, streaking across the grounds at night!

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.670
Whoa, hang on!

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.830
So there could be some super-sketchy pics of me in there?!

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.740
Sketchier than that?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.520
Find your own photos, all of them! Then get rid of them!

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.170
Oh, my! Who knew editing would get you so fired up?

Okay, next we'll choose photos for our school events!

This really was a one-of-a-kind year.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.070
Oh, but I haven't taken nearly enough photos!

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.460
I was aiming for a ten-thousand-page yearbook!

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.290
And we just keep tearing them up.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.880
The dictionary's not even three thousand pages!

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.480
Outside, class!

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.380
We'll dress up and take a wider variety of shots!

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.220


00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.180
Theme: History of Life That's it!

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.930
Theme: Japanese History That's the way.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.220
Theme: History of Religion Yes, nice!

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.770
Keep going! More outfits!

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.190
Korosensei did help us a lot with our entrance exams and stuff this February,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.840
but he's mostly been doing as he pleases.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.250
Yeah, with us totally at his mercy.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.530
He's probably indulging in your affection.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.620
You've come plenty far, thanks to your classes through January.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.160
Hey, babe. Karma got away from me, so lend me a hand, you two.
Now he wants to be pampered by his full-fledged students a little.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.460
Maybe that's what he's thinking.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.530
That makes sense.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.050
Do you think we turned out competent students, Karasuma-sensei?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.210
Sure.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.790
If I'm ever in any trouble, I'll trust you without hesitation.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.210
I know I can count on you.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.890
A man and a woman, come April... Living together, come April...

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.650
Come April... Ten times a day!

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.340
What's with all the mumbling lately?

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.600
She probably found some religion.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.630
What's the meaning of this?

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.480
We're having everyone cosplay at least once, Karasuma-sensei.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.660
Or perhaps this is a fitting?

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.330
Karasuma, I can't wait for that first night.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.670
Shut your mouth!

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.630
Phew! That ought to be enough on-campus photos.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.390
Hang on a sec!

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.320
Then why are we all stuffed in this bag?!

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.080
On-campus photos alone are hardly sufficient, of course.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.800
I'll be taking photos with you all around the world!

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.760
What, now?!

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.770
You've gotta be kidding!

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.980
Why go to such lengths?!

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.310
Because it's fun. And for the sake of that fun,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.950
I'll pull out all the stops to serve up the most elaborate yearbook ever!

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.010
Here we go!

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.780
Gum-Gum... Slingshot!

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.300
So I just need to pass this test?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.730
Yep. That'll mean you have what it takes to go back to school with confidence.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.560
Heck, you'll be able to breeze right through the first term's work.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.670
You can use that time to get used to your new class.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.540
Yeah...

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.170
When this is done, I'll go back to school.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.000
When this is done, I'll go back to school.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.000
When this is done... I'll go...

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080
back to...

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.920
My blade...

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.350
is most powerful as a tool of assassination.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.260
But...

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.350
Nagisa?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.680
It's all right. Calm down.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.810
You can do it if you try.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.920
I know you can.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.650
I will!

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.280
It's a different way of using my blade,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.190
but as long as I can see that look on her face...

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.080
Final Career Counseling Sessions
Once you're done, go on home!!

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:58.120
Now, then... Final Career Counseling Sessions

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.610
Have you found what you'd like to be, Nagisa-kun?

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.840
Korosensei...

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.100
I'm going to be a teacher.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.930
I'm not fast like you,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:20.350
or invincible like you, or smart like you...

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.650
But I want to be a teacher like you.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.030
That's good. It suits you.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.240
There is a talent bestowed upon all of you equally

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.320
that you will also all lose one day:

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.660
youth.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.000
Keep swimming forward now, without stopping,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.870
before this talent—your youth—escapes you.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.220
Yes, sir!

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.530
See you tomorrow, Korosensei!

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.610
Yes, see you then.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.130
Is that it for the career counseling?

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.270
Yes. They truly impress me, each and every one.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.180
The only big task left is editing that yearbook.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.140
Looks like I'll be spending my nights here for a while.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.040
I see.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.000
I'll need an article about the developments in your relationship with Irina-sensei.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.530
Set aside the next five hours for an exclusive interview, won't you?

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.720
Like hell! I'm leaving!

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.250
Make it an educational yearbook.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:40.180
I have to admit: we've learned so much in this classroom you've built.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.780
The students have...

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.830
and so have I.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.310
Report.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.860
He's in a classroom alone right now.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.860
But how do I choose?

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.450
He won't be going anywhere in a hurry.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.190
Well done, Special Agent Karasuma.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.760
You heard the man.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.990
Tonight, March 6th...

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.170
we will commence our final assassination as planned.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.930

Assassination Classroom Final Season Shiota Nagisa

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.410
First shot, a direct hit on the entire school building!

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.210
And the target?

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.440
Checking the footage now!

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.940
Look at that. It didn't leave a single scratch on the place.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.410
That's our Anti-Tentacle-Organism Permeable Laser Satellite,

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.280
codenamed "Spear of Heaven."

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.680
Powered by an antimatter lifeform engineered from a tortoise,

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.640
then further amplified in a gigantic particle accelerator,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.380
it fires a laser from an altitude of four hundred kilometers.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:40.180
This laser passes through any and all obstacles, liquefying tentacle organisms and no more.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.980
And we've just fired it without the slightest hint of advance warning.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.040
Surely that did the trick.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.560
The roof and my clothing are fine. It only hit my tentacles!

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.150
Good lord.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.280
Impossible... He dodged that?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.720
But it's a light-speed laser!

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.860
What canny intuition.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.200
But it's not over yet.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.370
Since you've survived and all,

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.180
why don't you try running away,

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.460
super-organism?

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.930
There's another weapon waiting for you there.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.000
Our Anti-Tentacle-Creature Permeable Laser Barrier,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.570
codenamed "Shield of Earth."

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.740
Lasers from a cluster of camouflaged ground facilities converge to form a barrier

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.160
that covers the entire mountain.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.740
Is this...

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.760
He has nowhere left to run.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.800
The lasers penetrate into the ground,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.720
forming a cage of light—not to kill him, but to prevent his escape.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.200
I was hoping we'd finish him off with that first shot.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.500
Once Plan B is in motion, all hell will break loose.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.040
Ready the ground troops!

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.000
Emergency deployment per Case B-1!

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.780
Yessir!

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.740
What the...

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.620
What's that light?

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.120
We were naïve.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.780
We thought things might stay as they'd been. That it might end uneventfully.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.840
They had everything in place.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.100
They'd planned it down to the tiniest detail, and we were none the wiser.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:48.920
These measures serve to confine one specific, dangerous creature who would do us harm.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.670
This creature, now with no place to run thanks to the Shield of Earth,

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.910
is the culprit behind the moon's destruction one year ago.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.280
We could not make its existence public until today, but this creature—

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.320
no, this monster—

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.990
has been in a standoff against the entire planet

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.950
after taking some of our nation's junior-high students hostage

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.680
and going undercover as a teacher.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.660
He is an extremely—

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.190
What's going on?

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.440
Looks bad!

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.470
This road is closed!

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.910
Please follow our instructions!

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.560
It'll take another week for the second shot to charge up.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.470
We may have hurt our chances, firing the first at twenty percent just so he wouldn't see it coming.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.680
But the next one will fire at one hundred percent charge, and he can't get away.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.620
His death is a done deal.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.860
All we have to do now is take care of public relations and deal with any troublemakers.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.500
Nagisa!

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:47.930
Kayano!

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.250
What is all this?!

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.150
Hey!

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.330
Whaddya mean, "no trespassing"?!

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.950
Look, just back off!

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.640
Nagisa! Kayano!

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.670
Did you see the news? This is awful!

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.100
Your attention, please!

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.250
We may have found the students that were threatened by that monstrous teacher!

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.560
You're those junior-high hostages, right?

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.340
Excuse me! How do you feel right now?

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.680
Tell us how relieved you are to hear he's been captured!

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.510
Korosensei's been captured?

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.770
What was it like spending a whole year in fear of a teacher who could explode at any second?

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:22.020
Dangerous Creature Captured Dangerous Creature Captured

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:20.200
A Year of Fear: Students Scarred Shut up!

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.200
What's this about him forcing you to perform sham assassinations?

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:22.020
A Year of Fear: Students Scarred

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.020
It's none of your business!

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:27.740
We have it on good authority that there's less than a one-percent chance of the Earth being destroyed!

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.200
He's not dangerous! Put that on TV!

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.740
He's not the evil teacher they're saying he is!

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.130
O-Oh!

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.680
Here, close up on this girl!

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.600
Did that monster tell you to say that?

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.210
How awful it must have been. You can tell us the truth.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.340
These are the innocent children that monster used as hostages!

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.000
We can surmise that the children were seriously traumatized by the experience.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.050
With hope, they'll be able to receive treatment as soon as possible.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:16:01.390
Junior-High Hostages: Psychological Impact Feared

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.740
Poor dears...

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:01.390
Who would do such terrible things to such innocent children?

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.240
Why are they pitying us?

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.190
You have no permission to film here. Leave at once!

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.600
B-But what about our duty to report the truth?

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.070
And terrify junior-high students for sheer entertainment value?

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.280
Some duty!

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.670
By the authority of the Ministry of Defense, this area is off-limits.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.950
In the interest of public safety, I must ask you to leave.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.010
I'll take these students into protective custody.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.430
Karasuma-sensei... what happened to Korosensei?

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.020
Your time ran out.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.990
The government implemented their last resort—

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.140
the one they'd been preparing all this time.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.960
Their last resort?

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.960
That barrier, you mean?

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.490
That's only a cage to keep him trapped.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:52.100
In a week, they'll use a high-powered laser to kill him.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.780
No! What about our assassination?

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.120
You've tried your best. Now leave the rest to us.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.830
Oh, so now you're the big man, all "Leave it to us," huh?!

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.490
We were completely in the dark!

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.550
And that statement made it sound like it's all Korosensei's fault!

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.410
This is unacceptable.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.760
They told us to kill him, and now they're elbowing in on our job?!

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.250
And it won't sit well with Korosensei unless we do the deed!

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.980
Karasuma-sensei, please! Let us go!

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.570
There are elite troops posted throughout town and on the mountain.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.300
You have no chance of besting them.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.900
Give it up.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.860
No!

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.050
There's so much we still want to talk about with Korosensei—

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.070
so much we still want to do with him!

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.410
So please, let us g—

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:48.790
I cannot allow you to! This is national policy!

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.880
Now, listen here, Nagisa-kun.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.760
I don't want any more trouble.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.300
Are we clear?

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.460
It's no use, Nagisa.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.120
In the end, he's just another stuffed shirt.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.200
When push comes to shove, he'll follow orders to save his own skin.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.020
That's exactly right.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.010
My position allows me to protect people when they need it most.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.930
And besides, even taking my personal opinion into account,

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.710
I'm thinking he should be killed after all.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.280
Arrange transportation and escorts for them at once.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.040
Sir!

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.260
Dammit! Karasuma, you bastard!

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.370
Terasaka-kun... Huh?

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:44.260
Karasuma-sensei just said "I don't want any more trouble"—very clearly.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.550
Yeah? So what?

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.600
Remember what he said earlier?

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.570
If I'm ever in any trouble, I'll trust you without hesitation.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.230
I know I can count on you.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:02.140
So I think he's saying that he's counting on us to deal with the trouble we're all in.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.320
We have Karasuma-sensei's trust. He's leaving this to us.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.830
So...

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.530
Let's put our heads together and sort it all out:

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.580
what we want to accomplish, what we're capable of,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.580
and what Korosensei would want us to do.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:27.310
Buff buff buff buff buff!

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.890
Buff it up nice, no wax needed!

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.820
Ah, that's care well taken!

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:42.310
There can't possibly be anything for a super-organism like me to fear this late in the game.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.220
But if I could have one wish...

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.490
I'd like to see them one last time.

Let's suck it up and bide our time.
