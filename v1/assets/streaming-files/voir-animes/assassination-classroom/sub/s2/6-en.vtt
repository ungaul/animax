WEBVTT

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.810
All right, class! The second-term midterms are just two weeks away!

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.970
The time has come at last to surpass the A Class!

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.070
Let's go into this red-hot! Hot! Hot!

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.280
That's too hot!

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.570
Ever since we dodged Asano-kun's trap at the sports festival,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.960
we've been able to focus all our efforts on our midterms.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.900
At the same time,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.630
we were all a little... restless, somehow.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.670
There were five months left until Korosensei's assassination deadline,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.670
and we were only growing more impatient.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.970
It's payback time!

00:00:34.970 --> 00:02:04.930


00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.080
What a rush!

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.150
Aw, yeah!

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.740
How's this for a shortcut to the station?

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.080
It's the best!

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.660
Wait up, everyone!

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.160
No parkour outside of class!

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.160
We'll be fine!

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.880
The sports festival already showed 'em we're no ordinary students!

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.420
We just might pull off that assassination after all!

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.280
What a shortcut!

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.030
What was that noise?!

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.310
Oh, no! I'll call an ambulance!

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.450
A hairline fracture of the right femur.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.540
It's mild enough that he should be up and walking in a week or so,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.990
but given that you kids are a state secret,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.550
my men are negotiating a gag order and an out-of-court settlement.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.950
We...

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.770
K-Korosensei... B-But it was such a narrow street.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.980
Who'd ever expect an old man to be riding his bike down there?

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.520
He's right.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.950
I do think that what we did was wrong.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.660
But we did it to sharpen up our skills.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.040
You just don't understand the pressure and panic of havin' to save the Earth.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.970
Will you report that as injuring the students?

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.390
I'll overlook it this once.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.430
I knew the risks when I introduced that high-level training.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.170
It may have been too soon for you after all.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.350
It's my fault.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.190
Sensei... We're sorry.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.230
We're really sorry. We screwed up.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.390
You may have grown too strong.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.990
Drunk on your newfound power,

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.080
you forgot to put yourself in the shoes of those weaker than you.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.870
That makes you no different than the students from the main campus.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.870
It hurt to be chastised like that, but what could we say in reply?

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.370
Is this what it means to make a mistake?

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.230
The midterms are now exactly two weeks away.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.610
I forbid any of you from studying for them.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.570
This is not a punishment.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.690
There are simply other things you should be studying first.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.660
The fault is partly mine for having forgotten to teach them.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.750
If you could please accept this offer, Matsukata-san...

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.790
I will not!

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.400
I need to spend two whole weeks cooped up in here!

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.330
A plain old apology won't be enough for those brats.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.200
I'll need, say... some kind of unprecedented... hmm...

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.940
bowing and scraping, say, or...

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.010
What the? Who put all these flowers here all of a sudden?

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.680
I-I'm so sorry!

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.230
Not only do I have a ten-billion-yen bounty on my head, but my students have caused so much trouble!

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.160
Listen up, children!

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.000
Principal Matsukata has been hurt, so he can't work for a while.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.910
What?

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.960
He got hurt?

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.960
Poor Mr. Principal!

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.050
So instead, these young men and women

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.460
will do anything we need for the next two weeks!

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.450
Okay!

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.920
Hmph.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.850
Give me a break.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.440
How'd we wind up with collective responsibility when we had nothing to do with this?

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.830
A witch!
She's a witch!

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.440
Spooky... I'm scared... We gotta get rid of her.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.960
Sorry. It's all our fault.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.560
They're really chomping on you!

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.530
We each got a sticky slap in the face too.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.240
Forgive me.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.990
He said he has to treat us all equally to keep things fair.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.930
I'm sorry.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.990
Forgive me.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.300
Sorry about this.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.700
It's all right. We should have realized someone could get hurt.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.610
I guess I might have supervisory responsibility...

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.700
as the trainer of this goofy circus troupe.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.540
Hey!

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.260
Well, we can do some stealth studying at home.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.220
Two weeks of unpaid work as a condition for keeping the E Class's secret?

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.390
A small price to pay if it means we can claim that bounty.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.730
Takebayashi...

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.720
He'd be pretty on point if he wasn't standing there in his underwear.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.270
There are lots of kids here with way too much energy.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.200
So what exactly are you planning to do for us, now?

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.040
Barging in on us en masse...

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.990
Reckon you can at least work off the oxygen you're consuming here?

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.620
And some with even more spite!

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.020
Uh-oh. Sakura-neesan's in a bad mood.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.130
Yeah... These guys are gonna get murdered.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.320
She's been here five years. She's the oldest kid around.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.600
And she's spent two of those years resisting school control!

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.170
Sakura-neesan, the elite NEET!

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.320
Something sure set you guys off.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.480
You make it sound cool and all, but really, she just spends her time playing hooky.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.060
First, have you got what it takes to work?

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.520
Hey, uh... Let's just see, shall we? Hmm?

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.990
Aw, that part of the floor's no good.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.270
Aren't you getting it fixed?

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.800
I mean... this building is pretty decrepit.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.580
We don't have the money.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.280
Any waitlisted student, any child not attending primary school—

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.090
our principal takes them in at rock-bottom rates.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:10.260
He can't even hire enough staff, so he winds up working harder than anyone.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.050
Twenty-eight of us for two weeks...

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.600
I reckon we could get something done.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.510
Sure we could!

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.180
Yeah!

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.190
Okay, everyone, let's divvy up the duties and work in his stead!

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.020
First, a strategy meeting!

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.020
Got it!

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.450
Please stop, Sir Karma! You mustn't hurt anyone else!

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.480
No, my princess. I must drive out this monster!

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.160
Otherwise, peace will ne'er return to our kingdom!

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.780
Karma, you jerk... The script says "no contact"!

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.880
Or was smackin' me around your plan all along?!

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.920
Wow, such realistic action!

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.090
Yeah! And that lady's acting really sucks me in!

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.970
Hey!

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.310
T-To your rest, monster!

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.230
The mage's chloroform put the monster to sleep unhurt.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.060
And they all lived happily ever after with the power of chemistry!

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.400
That's sneaky!

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.980
All right, children, if you liked that, clap your hands!

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.920
Kayano's great with kids.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.700
Yeah.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.720
She knows how to gauge the mood, and she's close to their size.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.210
So what are we heavy lifters supposed to do?

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.170
Chiba's putting together some blueprints with Ritsu.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.860
Okay, leave the decorations to us!

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.640
Ready, and... Wow!

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.600
Here, you have a shot.
Yay!

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.980
What a cute kitty cat!

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.090
I wonder if it's lost.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.100
What a huge help, having the students from a prestigious junior high

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.680
look over their work one-on-one!

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.510
Oh, no, miss. We're the bottom of the barrel.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.110
Please don't expect too much.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.890
This girl is a bit behind in her studies.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.650
It's bound to happen as long as she stays here instead of going on to school.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.350
Let's see...

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.160
How can I explain these equations so even a primary-school kid can understand it?

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.130
Hmm. Teaching's tough.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.450
Make it snappy, Nagisa!

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.130
Weren't you supposed to get me into the University of Tokyo?!

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.510
S-Sorry... Hmph!

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.420
Uh, hey...

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.710
Why did you stop going to school?

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.520
Huh?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.470
Bullying, of course! The typical stupid kind!

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.150
I just don't get people.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.650
Kids at this age are innocent and sweet.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.470
But once they get a little bigger and stronger,

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.410
it's like they just use that strength to hurt people.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.570
O-Ouch.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.950
You're thinking it too, aren't you?

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.000
"Don't run away."

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.100
"If you don't like it, go to school and get stronger yourself."

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.460
Just like Mom and Dad always say.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.300
Well,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.230
you look weaker than me, so you probably wouldn't understand.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.590
Here, kitty-kitty!

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.020
Oh, dear... Can't the kitty cat get down?

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.820
It's so little, it probably hasn't climbed a lot of trees yet.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.280
See what happens when you pluck up the courage to climb?

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.010
The higher you get, the more dangerous it is.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.710
What's the harm in staying down on solid ground?

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.160
This is one clichéd mess.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.300
I'll take care of it.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.600
Okajima, let's do what we did with the pole-toppling.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.670
Okay!

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.800
Gotta make sure it's safe down below.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.490
Sakura-chan...

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.850
If that treetop is school,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.210
and the ground is this place here...

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.690
we all found our strength down on the ground.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.160
Okay, all set!

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.370
While looking up, and getting looked down upon,

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:11.130
we learned plenty about how scary heights were before we started climbing.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.720
That's why we can go our own way now.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.990
Gotcha!

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.920
Yowch!

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.380
Still, somewhere along the way we forgot our fear of heights,

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.100
so we do still fall to the ground now and then.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.600
So learn what you can here.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.940
You can go on to school once you have a game plan.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.610
My secret lesson will give you what you need.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.260
Nagisa...

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.910


00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.270
Our work here was full of firsts.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.080
And as we spent our time, learning so many things we'd never cover in school,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.870
the two weeks were over before we knew it.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.560
Thank you so much for accommodating our request.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.260
Hmph.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.850
When you said it was to make your students more well-rounded,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.530
well, as a fellow educator, I couldn't say no.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:19.110
I just hope that wooden shack hasn't collapsed under their weight.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.750
Hmm? Oh!

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.450
Before!

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.400
After!

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.530
This is unbelievable!

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.640
A house built with trees culled from the E Class's mountain

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.500
and from discarded lumber.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.940
This was once a cramped and humble preschool building...

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.720
But what's this?

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.430
It's now a roomy and substantial multipurpose space!

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.350
Oh, my... In only two weeks?

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.100
Computerized calculations mean it's perfectly sturdy.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.560
New pillars now shore up the entire, near-crumbling main building.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.490
Our calculations were drawn from architecture all over the world!

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.990
The second floor is divided into two rooms, one being a library

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.950
where the kids can focus on studying or reading.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.790
The layout is fairly simple, given our limited time and resources.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.730
We went through the neighborhood collecting used children's books.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.130
Including mine!

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.840
The other room is an indoor playground.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.300
Careful placement of netting and mats ensure safety,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.720
and since it's all out of the rain,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.020
the equipment won't grow brittle from corrosion or rust.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.690
These kids... Next up is the garage.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.650
The garage?

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.860
Whoa!

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.040
Oh, my goodness me!

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.370
The tech squad has entirely remodeled the principal's bicycle,

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.580
which had its front wheel bent in the fall!

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:59.540
Now it's an ultra-safe, high-load-bearing, electric-assisted three-wheeler!

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.450
The revolving playscape upstairs is connected to a battery charger.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:08.010
The bike was designed to draw most of its power from that rotation.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.160
In other words... the more children use the playscape,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.010
the more they'll help out their principal!

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.600
This is all too perfect!

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.690
You've done far too well! It's actually a little creepy!

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.800
The principal's beloved old dentures were reused in the trike's bell.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.280
No one needs that much attention to detail!

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.990
Besides...

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.560
You can bring all these things up to scratch,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.700
but if you didn't get in close to these children's hearts,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.860
then I can't say you've done your job these two weeks.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.500
Hey, Nagisa!

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.710
Ta-dah! I came in second!

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.600
Wow, that's great! Well done!

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.430
I did just what you said!

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.890
I came in only for my math test, like a sneak attack.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.430
I finished the test and left.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.980
And the bullies couldn't do a thing while there was a test going on.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.850
Yep!

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.650
Aside from the teacher, I didn't tell anyone I was coming.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:12.820
Using your best attack before your opponent can get into position:

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.760
that's how we fight in the E Class, Sakura-chan.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.080
Keep on using those hit-and-run tactics,

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.790
and you'll have more weapons at your disposal in school.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.310
Th-Then...

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.960
You'll continue to teach me from time to time, right?

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.550
Of course!

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.260
That's one scary dude.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.720
His very obliviousness is what makes him so terrifying.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.210
You brats... I can't come up with a single complaint.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.400
Oh, welcome back, Principal! Look at this!

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.990
You all run back to school, now.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.070
You have some important work to attend to.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.300
Yes, sir!

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.750
See you later!

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:12.400
And so, our special lesson came to an end.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.510
However...

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.460
The midterms were the very next day.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.970
It was a disaster.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.100
The majority of the E Class got booted out of the top spots.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.830
What a letdown.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:37.230
Guess that last time was just a fluke, eh?

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.990
We didn't even need to smash you at pole-toppling.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.750
Cat got your tongue? That's not surprising.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.820
At this school, grades are everything.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.000
Those on the bottom have no right speaking to those at the top.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.380
Really?

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.970
Then you can't say anything to me, now, can you?

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:02.350
Only one student in the E Class remained undaunted by that two-week handicap.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:06.850
I didn't miss the traces of major prep work at his house

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.740
on the day of the summer festival.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.990
I mean, our teacher'll probably be like,

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.740
"It's not good enough if you didn't come in first."

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.360
Karma-kun!

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.410
Hasn't it dawned on you?

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.140
I'm the only one who gave it his all this time around.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.410
Everyone else was pulling their punches for you.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.760
They were worried you'd have no standing if you kept on losing.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.750
Say what?!

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.260
But we won't go easy on you next time.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.470
C'mon!

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.860
Karma-kun...

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.860
He really covered for us.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:55.180
We're so sorry for all the trouble, Karasuma-sensei.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.110
All in a day's work. Don't worry about it.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.800
What about you?

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.450
Have you learned anything from this?

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.470
It's not for our own money... or our grades.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:14.880
It reminded me that we can use the strength we've gained for others too.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.380
If we have the power to kill, we can save the Earth.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.390
If we have academic ability, we can help people.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.480
And we won't use it so carelessly again.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.470
We'll be careful—in lots of ways.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.610
Failure and frustration, too, are sources of growth.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.630
Surely this will make them all stronger.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:44.160
They should just keep applying themselves— to their studies and assassination alike.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.030
Now, then...

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.500
Time for a little BBQ with the foie gras I bought on the sly at a French farmer's market!

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.800
At least I've kept this from my students!

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.240
Wh-Where the heck did you come from?!

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.510
Wow! A fall from that height, and it didn't hurt a bit!

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.090
Wh-What's going on? I barely had time to breathe!

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.990
We wanted you to see this, Korosensei!

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.360
New equipment from the government.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.040
I told them not to tip their hand...

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.800
but they really wanted to show you how they use their new powers.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.880
We'll respond to your lessons with assassination.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.250
It's how we do things around here.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.670
We promise you, Korosensei:

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:46.220
we won't use this power for any purpose other than protecting people.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.000
You get full marks for that answer.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:57.180
When I first came here, all I found was some stagnant bloodlust here and there in the classroom.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.500
There was little danger of being assassinated, but it was a cold place.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.360
Now, though...

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.770
the whole campus is bubbling over with warm-hearted bloodlust!

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.230
Someday, you too will come across such a challenger.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:21.670
Yes. I have so many of them now, right before my eyes.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:22:54.930
