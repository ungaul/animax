00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.110
Whoa, wait...

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.880
Oh, my god... Ohmigod!

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.570
Th-This is one of my favorites, too.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.400
This is super cute!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.510
You're literally an angel!

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.520
Juju-sama, I just can't with you!

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.870
You took all these photos, right, Shinju-chan?

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.760
Yes... You're seriously amazing.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.060
I love the photos you take, Shinju-chan.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.330
Th-Thank you... I just asked her to take my photos,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.850
but she's the one who created my account and came up with my cosplay name.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.950
Huh... Why is that?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.640
Well...

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.830
My sister won't show anyone her photos.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.260
I just wanted someone to see these cute pictures of my sister,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.030
so I asked her if it was okay to make an account.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.080
And then she got so many likes.

Post Likes: obaba33, and others

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.660
But, I didn't know how to reply to all of these strangers...

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.650
So I ended up ignoring all of them.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.900
That's why you didn't interact with anyone, huh?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.380
Yes... I'm just cosplaying for myself.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.210
I don't care what other people think.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.240
But, but... You've got so many followers now!

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.640
Everyone thinks you're so cute.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.800
It made me really happy.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.300
Shinju-chan.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.080
Yes?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.460
You must really love Juju-sama!

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.400
Yes!

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.280
I love her so much!

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.280
Juju-sama looks super happy.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.530
O-Oh, shut up.

Episode 8
Backlighting Is the Best

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.550
We're borrowing our father's DSLR for our camera.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.300
It looks so cool!

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.950
Is your dad a professional photographer?

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.300
No, photography is just his hobby.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.720
So mature!

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.890
This camera is great because you don't have to change the lens!

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.810
Do you usually switch out lenses?

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.190
You can change them to fit your preferences.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.070
Fisheye Lens Normal Lens Telephoto Lens

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.070
If you change out the lens,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.070
you get different results, even when taking the same photo. It's a lot of fun!

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.470
Question.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.550
Uh, yes? G-Gojo-san...

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.080
Is there a big difference compared to shooting with a smartphone?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.280
Yes.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.170
The camera gives you a higher resolution and there's so much more you can do.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.170
For example, if you take a photo with flowers in the background...

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.880
You can blur the background to make the cosplayer stand out more.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.890
Or you can blur the foreground and make the whole photo look soft.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.240
If you play with the shutter speed,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.020
you can take a photo with falling petals without them being blurry.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.630
That's amazing!

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.030
Aw, man... That sounds like so much fun.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.020
Yes!

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.820
Whenever a picture turns out how I want,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.860
or I coincidentally get a great expression,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.440
it makes me so happy.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.950
It makes me want to become better so I can take even better photos.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.200
Plus, you're taking pics of the Juju-sama!

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.810
You must be hyped!

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.920
Yes.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.020
By the way, you don't cosplay, Shinju-chan?

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.840
Doesn't seeing so many cosplayers make you want to try it?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.460
And you're like, "They're so cute! That seems super fun!"

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.820
"So maybe I'll try it, too," yeah?

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.640
Me...?

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.310
Did you want to cosplay, too?

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.330
No...

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.810
Not at all.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.430
It doesn't make me want to do it.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.650
I just like taking pictures of my sister.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.320
I'm not going to cosplay...

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.700
Oh, I see.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.430
Yes.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.220
Hey, Shinju-chan. Can I touch your camera?

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.230
Sure.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.330
Cameras are so cool!

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.080
I wanna take a photo with a neat background bokeh effect!

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.400
I'm totally saving up so I can buy one.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.040
How much do DSLRs cost?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.550
Tsaica camera shop (All 5 Shops)

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.160
Oh, here we go.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.350
Huh?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.920
camera shop (All 5 Shops)

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.350
Huh?!

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.680
Monochrome (All 7 Shops)

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.720
(All 7 Shops)

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.720
(Lens Sold Separately)

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.000
Lens sold separately?!

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.890
Dude, you're so loud!

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.350
If you add a tripod, flash, and the rest of the equipment, it costs even more.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.060
10,000 Yen

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.710
Your mind's totally blown, Gojo-kun.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.220
I can't believe the cameras everyone had at the other day's event were so expensive...

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.660
Crazy, am I right?

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.150
Well, I guess we'll just have to keep using our smartphones until I save up.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.840
Ah...

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.000
Kitagawa-san's not even hesitating on buying one.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.050
There are all kinds of cameras, so make sure you buy one that's in your budget.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.440
By the way, we're going to scout for shooting locations,
Thank you very much.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.520
but do you two want to come along?

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.600
It's the first time I'm renting a studio,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.810
so I figured I should check out my options first.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.590
Yeah, totally! I definitely wanna go!

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.720
I'm in!

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.520
I'd love to come along, as well.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.020
Okay, then let's meet up at Shim-Misato Station this weekend.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.280
Okay!

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.490
The place we're going...

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.530
is a studio studio set up in an abandoned hospital.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.730
I never knew there were studios like this.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.200
This is totally my first time at an abandoned building.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.530
Mine, too!

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.570
I was so excited for today...

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.310
I could barely fall asleep last night!

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.510
Whoa, holy crap! This place rules!

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.510
Oh, so it's this kind of place... You know...

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.510
Dude, this place is way gloomier than I thought it'd be!
This is perfect for the abandoned hospital where Black Lily runs

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.960
after she's defeated by Princess Daisy's straight right.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.640
Yeah.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:06.150
Mumble Mumble Mumble Mumble Mumble

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.700
It's a depressing development,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.290
but I really like the scene where Shion starts to question herself.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.150
More importantly, I guess you really did watch the whole thing.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.520
Gojo-kun!

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.380
We're gonna take a look upstairs!

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.320
All right.
Let's go, Shinju-chan!

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.420
Yes!

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.520
It has a certain atmosphere, doesn't it?

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.400
Is something wrong?

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.540
N-No...

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.920
Inui-san, could it be...

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.590
Do places like this make you uncomfortable?

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.410
Th-That's not true at all.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.840
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.510
Come on! Let's go!

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.970
Ah, so I was right...

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.480
Hm... I mean, it's decent...

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.010
Isn't it a bit too dark, though?

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.100
We have a flash, so we'll be fine.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.770
You're, like, invincible!

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.010
Flashes and reflectors can be used for outdoor shoots, too,

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.500
so they're great to have.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.000
Even if it's sunny outside?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.800
Yes!

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.420
When it's nice outside, it's hard to keep your eyes open because it's too bright,

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.700
so you make it your backlighting.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.200
Your skin will look nicer, too.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.220
But then, your face gets darker... Aha!

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.780
So then you use the reflectors to brighten up your face!

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.820
Yes!

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.430
It makes wigs shine and improves your complexion, too.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.230
That's super amazing! I'll pass that along to Gojo-kun, too!

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.060
Backlighting is the best.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.600
X-Ray Room Looks like it's gonna rain.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.680
Yes...

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.160
Man, I'd love to do a shoot somewhere we can get some awesome pics.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.830
Actually, where do you guys go to take outdoor pics?

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.050
Our yard...

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.150
It's really coming down...

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.390
Are you all right?

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.180
Inui-san?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.490
I-I-I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.700
Yeah, she's not fine at all.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.350
Do you want to wait at the entrance?

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.350
No!

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.440
I'm going to cosplay Black Lily.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.900
I have to properly see what this place looks like...

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.920
or I won't be able to get good pictures.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.140
I can go look for you, so please wait at the entrance.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.140
Hey! I'll do this myself!

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.460
But you're pushing yourself, aren't you?

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.970
Is there a reason?

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.260
Do you...

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.180
have any dreams for the future?

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.960
Yes.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.020
To become a hina doll kashirashi.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.980
A job where you make the dolls' faces.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.350
That's a lovely dream.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.650
You'd better make sure it comes true.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.730
In my case...

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.880
I wanted to become a magical girl.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.450
They're just so strong, dazzling, and cool,

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.290
while wearing cute, frilly, little outfits.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.050
I looked up to magical girls so much when I was little.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.300
I was obsessed.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.710
I seriously wanted to become one when I got older.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.760
But once you get into elementary school, you figure it out.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.770
Flower Princess Blaze!!
It's all make-believe.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.170
And no matter how much I worked as hard like a magical girl, or prayed...

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.250
I knew my dream would never come true.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.480
But then, when I was in middle school...

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.300
I found out you could buy the outfits.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.210
I didn't have any prior knowledge, so I didn't even know how to style the wig.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:55.210
I didn't have any makeup on, and the outfit was too big for me.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.340
My first cosplay was just awful...

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.220
But still... I was so, so happy.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.180
Even if I have to push myself, even if it's all make believe...

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.760
I want to make my own dream come true.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.340
Inui-san.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.300
What?

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.780
Why did you ask me to make such an important outfit for you?

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.510
There are so many people better than me.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.910
You should ask someone else.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.020
Why did you choose me?

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.210
When I saw Marin Kitagawa's photos...

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.840
I was jealous.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.160
I know how pathetic being jealous is...

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.600
But I was so horribly envious, I didn't know what to do.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.430
I thought, "I also want to wear an outfit made by this person."

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.260
It had to be them.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.020
You're right. There are plenty of people who can make outfits.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.100
But...

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.380
I'm sorry.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.710
I can't explain this very well.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.380
It's not exactly logical.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.500
I think the best way to describe it is...

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.090
Seeing the outfit you made was love at first sight.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:23.030
To be honest, I'm surprised at myself for being jealous.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.350
But jealousy's something you feel about things that matter.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.930
Ain't they beauties?

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.420
Your ol' gramps and his friends made these hina dolls.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.970
Ain't that amazing?

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.440
Uh-huh. Wow...

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.380
They're so pretty.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.950
She's the most beautiful thing in the world...

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.790
The most beautiful in the world, eh?

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.670
Out of all the doll shops out there,

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.850
we're doin' everything we can to get these beauties

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.950
to catch the eyes of customers, so they'll think these are the best there are.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:05.130
So hearin' you say they're the best makes your Gramps really happy.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.840
What does "catch the eyes" mean?

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.400
Hm... How do I put this?

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.190
Basically, we want people to experience love at first sight with 'em.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.380
Me, too...

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.190
When I get older, I want to make hina dolls, too.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.050
I want to be like you, Gramps.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.330
With a little bit of practice, you'll be just like your Gramps.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.120
Uh?!

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.010
Gramps... Uh, what? Wait, what?

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.600
Why the heck are you crying?!

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.640
What's your deal?

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.020
What?! What?! Wh-What the heck is going on?!

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.730
Say something, damn it!

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.910
Fank you sho much...

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:07.810
I just now... realized how happy Gramps was back then!

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.210
I never imagined it was something like this.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:15.600
I promise... I absolutely promise that I'll do my best, so you'll...

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.100
Sajuna Inui, age seventeen.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.840
Because she attends a private all-girls school,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.290
this was the first time she had a boy around her age

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.840
hold her hand.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.430
Inui-san?! What's wrong, Inui-san?!
Gojo-kun?

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.080
Dude, the thunder's crazy out there. You guys good?
Are you okay, Inui-san?!

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.160
Final Exams We're done!

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.840
Gojo-kun!

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.860
Let's go to the beach!

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.940
Like, right now!

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.870
Huh?

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.780
Swimming season hasn't started yet and there's no one around, so this is the best, am I right?

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.870
We've basically got the whole place to ourselves.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.310
We're actually here...

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.560
Um... Did we come here today to take some photos?

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.320
During our location hunt, you said you wanted to try taking some backlit photos.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.800
Somewhere to take Instagrammable pics.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:18.560
Huh?

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.560
Huh?

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.440
Nah, that's not it at all.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.680
We're done with finals, right?

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.700
Right.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.400
And it's July, right?

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.190
And it's summer, right?

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.450
"We headin' to the beach!"

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.810
That's all.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.440
Doesn't going to the beach in your uniform just scream the power of youth?!

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.420
This is epic!

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.830
That's right... This is how Kitagawa-san is...

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.760
She's incredibly proactive...

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.420
Definitely eating from this place again.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.690
Gojo-kun, could you give me some fries?

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:50.470
Sure...

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.760
French fries, French fries, yay!

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.290
Ahh... Huh?!

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.220
Wait...

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.980
Hey!

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.190
My burger!

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.880
That bird's still following us.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.440
Should we go somewhere else to eat?

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.780
Nah, we came all the way here.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.280
You wanna have bubble tea while looking at the ocean?

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.250
We even brought a mat with us.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.300
We can figure out what to do if that bird steals our food again later.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.540
All right.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.260
Gojo-kun?

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.030
Please give up on the French fries!

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.020
Let's make a break for it!

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.150
We still have one more burger!

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.870
Oh, no. That was probably littering...

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.110
Let's go!

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.130
Bye-bye, Mr. Hambirdglar!

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.350
Here you go.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.610
But that's yours, Gojo-kun. Are you sure?

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:05.490
Yes.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.870
Thank you...

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.260
Mm.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.830
It's super good.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.770
Thank you.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.770
I never knew whitebait was good on burgers.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:23.870
I know, right?

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.060
Yo, this bubble tea is bomb.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.830
Want a sip, Gojo-kun?

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.330
Huh?

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.250
No, that's all right.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.400
Yeah?

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.530
The breeze feels so nice.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.500
Yes.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.380
All right, I'm going in.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.140
Hang onto this for me.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.970
Huh? Wait, you're going to swim?

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.100
'Course not! I'm just gonna soak my feet!

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.570
I decided this spur-of-the-moment, so I didn't bring a swimsuit, either!

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.230
Here I go!

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.120
It's so cold! It feels awesome!

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.800
What a free spirit...

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.990
Oh, man!

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.580
Dude! I caught some seaweed!

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.740
Do you see this stuff? It's hilarious!

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.470
Look, Gojo-kun, look!

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.620
Oh, I am... Gojo-kun, get in here, my dude!

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.350
It's like, the best thing ever!

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.800
Uh, okay!

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.430
Hurry, hurry!

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.270
One moment... please.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.960
Whoa, a wave.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.180
It really is cold.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.740
Wow...

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.480
Um, my feet seem to be sinking into the sand?!

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.300
You're way too freaked out.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.020
It's like you've never been to the beach.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.160
Uh, it is... Huh?

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.490
Wait, really?

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.290
No way... Then again, I guess Saitama's pretty landlocked.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.260
Er, that's not it, exactly.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.850
Ever since I was little, the way I had fun was staring at hina dolls

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.880
and practicing how to draw the faces.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.230
That's all I ever did, so I never thought of doing anything else.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.720
As a result, there are a lot of places I've never been.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:47.470
Gramps told me that I should observe a lot of things.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.870
He was right.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.850
This is nothing like what I've seen on TV or in photos.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.260
The beach is very nice.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.700
It's beautiful.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.520
Then... we should go to all sorts of places together!

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.570
I-It's almost summer vacation, right?

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.120
I'll invite you everywhere!

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.620
So let's go... J-Just the two of us!

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.580
Are you sure?

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.660
I would love to!

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.910
That makes me really happy.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.510
Y-You know... I'm getting a little thirsty...

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.180
I'm gonna have some more tea.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.620
Okay.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.730
I-I totally just blurted, "Just the two of us!"

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.730
Oh, my god! Oh my freakin' God! Ohmigod!

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.920
I'd be so embarrassed if he saw how red my face was! Like, I'd literally die!

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.440
Hold up.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.420
This means I'm gonna see him all summer break.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.620
Whoa, I literally can't... Holy crap.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.410
Wow...

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.100
She wasn't joking.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.550
He looks super amazing.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.400
Uh, dude?!

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.850
Gojo-kun?!

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.910
My body... My whole body's covered in seaweed!

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.290
It's all slippery! And slimy!

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.300
Gojo-kun, are you okay?!

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.660
What the heck are you doing?!

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.670
I-I tried to go a bit further, and I slipped on some seaweed.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.170
You're totally soaked!

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.200
Oh, no... How can I go home like this?

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.480
Oh, you'll dry off by then... I think!

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.980
Episode 9
Because There Was a Lot That I Saw in That Photo

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.280
Next time!
