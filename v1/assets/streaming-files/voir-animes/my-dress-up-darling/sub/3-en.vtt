WEBVTT

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.850
Oh, damn!

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.470
No, really. I'm super happy about this.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.610
You're the best, Gojo-kun!

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.520
It fits perfectly.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.390
Yup! It's absolutely perfect!

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.490
Now, we just need to apply the wig... Wait, Gojo-kun.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.720
Yes?

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.900
Y-You see, when I cosplay,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.500
I-I even start feeling like the character.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.430
Huh?

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.260
G-Gojo... Gojo-kun... M-Ma... Master...

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.550
P-Pwease...

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.030
look at my naughty bits...

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.910
Pwease... look.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.710
Gojo Dolls

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.430
The hell kind of dream was that?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.270
Could...

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.020
Could you look the other way?

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.030
Episode 3
Then Why Don't We?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.900
Morning.
Morning!

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.910
How could I start the morning like that?

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.050
H-How am I supposed to face Kitagawa-san after that happened?

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.710
Ah, Kitagawa-san.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.490
Marin-chan's such a cutie.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.670
Yo, Kitagawa.
Her legs are so thin!

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.090
Mornin'!

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.470
Is she a model or something?

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.430
Yeah, I think so.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.580
She's totally on another level, down to the bone.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.320
She's probably pretty popular, huh?

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.540
Of course, she is!

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.100
Honestly, I'd love to go out with her myself.
Really, it's hard to believe...

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.110
that she was at my house just this weekend.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.460
Keep calm. Keep calm!

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.650
Ah, Gojo-kun!

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.160
Mornin'!

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.700
G-Good morning.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.160
Thanks for your help on Saturday!

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.790
I'm one step closer to Shizuku-tan, so you totes made my day!

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.400
I-I'm so sorry... Huh? About what?

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.680
Hey, what do you think? I decided to curl my hair today.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.810
Oh, uh, yes. You sure... did.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.140
That's it? You're hilarious.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.320
S-Sorry.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.100
Whatcha talkin' about?

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.520
Let me join in!

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.160
Oh, this is Kitagawa-san's friend... Yo! I'm Nowa!

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.150
G-Good morning.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.750
G'morn.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.880
Mornin'!

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.820
Mornin'.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.220
I-I'm surrounded...

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.370
Guess we haven't talked before. Nice to meet ya.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.460
Uh, yes! Pleasure to meet you!

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.330
Want a sucker?

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.580
Huh? Th-Thank you very much...

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.400
No, really. What's going on?

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.490
He's obviously super bothered. I feel bad for him.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.290
Don't be a nuisance.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.750
He's not bothered at all!

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.850
R-Right!

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.340
Hey, Marin. We need to get to the vending machine. First period's about to start.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.100
Crap! You're right.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.460
See you later, Gojo-kun!

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.870
Sure.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.260
Wait, I only have a thousand-yen bill.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.570
Kitagawa-san's treating me the same way, even at school.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.970
Wait, is she going out with that guy?

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.700
What?

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.910
No way. Can you even imagine?

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.140
I know, right?

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.500
Gojo-kun!

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.670
Hey, hey, listen! After school today—

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.830
S-Sorry. I've got something I've gotta do.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.560
Gojo-kun!

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.770
So today—

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.480
Maybe he had to pee.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.730
Gojo-kun?

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.860
Gojo-kun!

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.980
Gojo-kun?!

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.990
Gojo-kun!

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.460
Gojo-kun!

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.380
Man, close one! I almost didn't catch you before you left.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.070
Kitagawa-san...

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.310
Gojo-kun, will you come shopping with me, like, right now?

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.910
I wanted to check out the stuff we'll need for the outfit.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.360
I'm sorry.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.520
I'm going to have to pass.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.980
Huh? Wait, hello?!

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.490
Gojo-kun?!

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.190
This was in the opposite direction than the station,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.600
so I'll just hang out here for a bit.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.600
It was nice of her to invite me, but...

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.500
I'm so sorry, Kitagawa-san.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.570
If you're just gonna apologize, don't run off in the first place!

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.960
K-Kitagawa-san! What are you doing here?

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.100
You're right out in the open. But seriously, Gojo-kun,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.760
you've been avoiding me today, haven't you?

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.470
That really sucks.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.300
If you've got a problem with me, out with it.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.410
Well...

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:09.190
P-People are going to think that we know each other.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.820
So...

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.000
It's probably better if you're not with me when other people are around.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.800
Huh? What are you even saying?

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.000
We're already friends!

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.050
Huh?

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:31.010
B-But I even overheard some people speculating that we might be going out...

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.260
Seriously? Huh...

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.680
Then why don't we?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.120
Huh?! B-But, I...

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.100
JK! C'mon!

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.950
Let's go, Gojo-kun!

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.960
Huh? Wh-Where are we going?

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.870
I told you! Shopping!

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.460
The World's Hobby Shop Yuzawaya

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.710
They have a whole cosplay section.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.330
Yup! Lots of people cosplay these days.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.440
Like on Halloween.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.830
I see...

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.960
Oh, Kitagawa-san...

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.520
Could you take a look at this?

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.700
Holy shit.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.130
I drew a multi-view design of Shizuku-tan.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.080
We need quite a few things.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:29.690
Fabric Fabric, lace, ribbons, artificial roses, Lace

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:29.690
Ribbon Artificial roses shoes, a wig, fasteners, Shoes

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.690
Wig Fasteners color contacts, garters, stockings,

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.700
Color contacts Garters &amp; stockings and then...

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.740
Wait, hold up!

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.520
Holy crap. Did you draw all of this, Gojo-kun?

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.230
Yes.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.820
This is insane!

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.080
Make the back and the apron frilly.
Shoulder circumference 34.5cm
The apron material should be thick

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:49.130
Ribbon length to her butt

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.080
Garter stockings should have a nice balance between the mesh and stockings
Foot circumference 22.4 cm Unique shoes Gothic Lolita?

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:49.130
Hips 84.8 cm It's important that the material flares out

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:58.100
Make this a lighter color than the apron.
Ankles 19.2 cm Foot width: 9.5 cm
Bust 86.8 cm Make her chest stand out more?

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.080
The lace should be black with roses on it Underbust

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:49.130
Horizontal circumference of head 53.8 cm We'll make the wig violet Shizuku-tan has an asymmetrical bob, so we'll buy a longer wig then cut it.
Vertical circumference of head 57.7 cm Right side has 2 roses Left side has 1 Lace should also be rose-patterned
Upper arm 22.9 cm Make the sleeve up top tighter and then have it flare out at the bottom.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.080
Purple contact lens Waist 58.7

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:49.130
Add lace w/ roses here Collar above a black necktie
Thin eyebrows and droopy eyes Purple contact lens

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.210
The skirt is pretty poofy.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.140
Yeah.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.730
I think you should wear a petticoat with a lot of volume underneath.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:49.130
Roses should be red Should we go for a deeper or more vibrant color?
Should the ribbon be the same color as the headdress? Or should we change it up a little?
The lace here should be white and It should be 1-2 cm or so visible from the black material.
Picking the right material will be key Pick a material where the sleeves and skirt can flare out
Use a different ribbon for the bow so it stays in its shape better?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:58.100
Underbust 68.2 cm
The lace should be black with roses on it
Black ribbon, cross-laced. Make it so we can tie it into a bow at her chest?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:49.130
Waist 58.7

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.830
We'll have to buy one that's ready-made, but...

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.370
Okay! Let's do it!

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.440
And the shoe style is also rather unique,

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:58.100
Make this silver just like the collar.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.630
so we should probably buy them at a specialty shop.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.840
This style is called Gothic Lolita, right?

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.100
I'll look for them!

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.410
Oh, hey... What about the collar?

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.140
I-Is it even possible to make those?

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.990
I might be able to find them at V-kei shops.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.340
I'll keep my eye out for this, too.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.750
Th-Thank you very much.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.820
Hey, I think this one will work.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.530
What do you think?

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.910
Well...

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.420
I think this one would work better.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.130
Huh? Why? Is there actually a difference?

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.640
Slippery Girls Academy is an academy for upper-class girls,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.460
so that would mean Shizuku-tan's uniform would probably reflect that.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.850
I figured we should go with fabric that's a bit thicker and heavier, rather than glossy.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.960
Oh, I see!

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.860
Oh... But it's literally double the price of the other material.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.440
Wait, I wasn't planning on shopping today,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.350
so I don't have any cash on me!

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.400
Ah, don't you worry about that.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.880
Blingy, blingy, blingy, bling baby.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.580
Mama went to the bank.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.470
Use as much as you like!

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.530
Huh?!

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.260
A-As much as I like? But I couldn't!

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.410
Oh, it's fine!

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.220
I saved all this for my cosplay by working, anyway.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.340
But...

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.670
Look at it this way, all my hard work will go to waste if you don't use it.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.340
All right.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.350
All right. Let's keep this ball rolling!

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.910
Handmade Hobby Shop Yuzuwaya
I think that should about do it.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.970
Thanks for carrying all that.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:46.970
Sure.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.980
Okay, let's go to Swallowtail next.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.160
Swallowtail?

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.930
You're gonna be shocked the moment you step in here.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.260
It's insane.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.440
Sure...

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.260
Wow...

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.940
I know, right? It gets you hyped up, doesn't it?

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.240
I love browsing in here.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.530
I can understand why.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.070
It really is amazing.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.660
They have so many variations for each color...

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.270
They're all... beautiful.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.080
Gojo-kun.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.340
I think I found it. Medium black.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.770
Black?

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.310
Yeah. Shizuku-tan has black hair, so let's buy this one.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.930
Kitagawa-san, let's do this color.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.560
Huh? But that's...

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.590
Purple.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.440
Yes.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.100
Shizuku-tan's character color is purple, right?

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.090
Her hair might seem black,

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.820
but I think if she had a purple tint, it'd seem more like Shizuku-tan.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.020
O-Oh, right.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.410
Kitagawa-san had no idea about the details...

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.820
So I think we should go with this black violet...

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.080
No, maybe this deep violet.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.460
I also think we should go for a longer length.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.630
Why?

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:23.080
Shizuku-tan has an asymmetrical bob, so a medium-length wig won't be long enough.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.030
Let's get a long-length wig and trim it.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.470
Okay! I'll have someone at my salon cut it!

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.480
That's great. If a professional hair stylist cuts it, it should be fine.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.940
I was originally planning on coming here alone today.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.810
Huh?

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:43.060
But I keep picking the wrong things at these stores.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.030
We would've been in a lot of trouble.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.410
I'm so glad you came with me, Gojo-kun.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.510
Thanks!

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.120
Okay, I'm gonna go buy this.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.830
Sure.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.590
I see.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:01.880
So I...

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.070
was actually useful.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.220
Sorry for the wait! I bought some color contacts, too!

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.880
I'll hold your bag for you.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.140
Oh, thanks.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.810
Now, all that's left is...

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.860
Garters and stockings!

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.780
Take your time!

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.820
K-Kitagawa-san, how much longer do you think you'll be?

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.080
Hm? Not much longer.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.760
Sh-Should I even be here right now?

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.630
D-Do I have permission?!

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.130
Like you need any.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.710
Yes, but... It might bother the other customers if there's a guy around!

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.070
Couples come here together all the time. You're fine.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.300
Huh?

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.070
I feel so awkward right now...

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.070
Kitagawa-san, please hurry.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.480
Damn, Gojo-kun!

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.810
Well?

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.300
Lookin' good, don't you think?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.100
I-I-I can see down there! Please cover up!

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:07.990
Actually...

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.000
I figured I needed to thank you for today... or something.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.620
Would you prefer something a bit sexier?

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.760
P-Please stop teasing me!

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.210
Jeez, you're loud.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.820
Thank you very much!
Tamashi New: Chilled Soba Limited Time Only

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.790
Thanks, come again!

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.130
That was super good.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.260
Yes, it really was.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.460
A high school couple, eh? Must be nice.
Thank you so much, Kitagawa-san.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.960
It's totes fine! I wanted to treat you!
Ah, to be young...

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.430
Meanwhile, I'm still stuck working.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.200
Oh, Gojo-kun. How far did you get in "Slippery Girls"?

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.230
I haven't gotten very far at all.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.840
What part are you on?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.580
The part where he's up in front of the whole school

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.490
at the morning assembly and couldn't stop ejaculating...

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.530
What the actual hell?
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.520
I panicked, too! He just wouldn't stop!

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.120
Why the hell are you grinning about it?!

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.650
Like what's even up with his body?

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.870
Damn, high schoolers these days are terrifying.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.960
I'll go ahead and take all this back to my place.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.180
Thanks!

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.130
I'll get the pattern drawn up, too.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.840
Seriously? Hell, yeah!

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:12.690
I wonder where I should wear the cosplay once it's done.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.350
Are there designated areas?

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.180
Yup!

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.380
There are events where cosplay groups get their photos taken...

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.380
Huge photoshoots where people rent out amusement parks and stuff...

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.710
Some people rent out photo studios, or even cosplay at home.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.540
Oh, I think I wanna take some purikura in cosplay, too.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.450
Basically, everyone can enjoy it however they want.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.660
I see.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.570
Also... you can upload your photos to social media.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.850
What?! You upload those to the internet?

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.070
Well, yeah. Lookie.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.340
Wow, that looks amazing!

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.550
I wonder if she got that done at a studio.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.060
It's so detailed...

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.460
Do you think she made her props, too?

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.930
She probably bought them.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.970
Oh, this person! Juju-san! Isn't she super cute?

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.060
I love her so much!

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.280
She does a lot of little girl anime characters, like magical girls.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.610
She's super gorgeous,

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.150
and the quality of her cosplay and photos is off the charts!

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:14.570
Juju +Follow Cosplayer Magical girls / Little girl anime 0 Following 51,928 Followers

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.940
She's got a ton of followers!

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.610
But apparently she doesn't go to events,

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.570
so she's like this mystery, but I'm pretty sure she's a total pro.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.230
She looks very young.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.240
How old do you think she is?

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.570
Hm... Maybe in middle school?

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.010
She might even be in grade school.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:23.830
Huh?

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.580
Oh, this shot!

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.060
She's cosplaying pre-transformation Shion Nikaido-tan from Flower Princess Blaze!!

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:33.210
I love this so much! She's so cute I could literally die!

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.630
Kitagawa-san, you seem very fond of black hair.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.220
Look who's talking.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.210
Er, well, I...

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.640
Yes.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.790
Wow, this person's awesome, too! They're so pretty!

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.480
Oh, they're gorgeous, too!

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.070
I swear, a lot of girls who cosplay guys are effing gorgeous.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.640
Oh, damn. This one's stunning, too.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.920
You haven't said a word. You don't think they're pretty, Gojo-kun?

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.510
Huh? No, that's not it.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.840
So, what's up?

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.070
Well...

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.090
I'm sorry if this is kind of annoying.

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:20.280
Gojo Dolls I'm an only child,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.550
so the first time I ever saw a hina doll was at my Gramps's place.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.280
I couldn't take my eyes off of her.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.250
I couldn't believe something so beautiful could exist in this world

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.240
and was just so moved.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.840
It felt like she had taken hold of my heart.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:07.520
And then, I realized the word "beautiful" existed for things like that.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.100
Ever since then, the word "beautiful"

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.830
became associated with very special things to me.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:22.060
So I just can't say "pretty" or "beautiful" unless I absolutely feel it from the heart.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.290
Huh...

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.900
But I mean, hina dolls are painted to look super gorgeous, right?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.910
Gojo-kun, you're totally a face guy.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.630
I didn't mean it like that...

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.500
I'm sorry.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.570
I have a hard time expressing it...

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.540
It's not like I'm denying that those people look nice...

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.440
If that's what you decided, I think that's totally fine.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.920
It's important to have things you refuse to compromise on.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.110
I have things I'm picky about, too.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.610
Like boob bags?

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.470
Yup!

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.360
Authentic Miyazaki-style Meat-wrapped Onigiri
Oh, snap! Hold up!

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.370
How could I possibly pass those up?!

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.410
It looks so good!

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.810
Are you sure you didn't want one, Gojo?

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.200
I would've totally treated you again.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.670
Yes, I'm fine. Thanks.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.870
Well, I'm digging in, then.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.560
Yum!

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.300
How does she have room after we just had ramen?

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.900
I did splurge a bit today, though. Guess I'll just have to work more.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.350
Wait, I'll pay you back for the ramen!

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.350
What? I told you that was on me.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.040
I basically dragged you around all day.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.850
But—

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.080
Really, it's totally fine.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.410
I was just...

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:46.940
really happy.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:53.420
It's not often that someone actually plays a game I recommend.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.750
Most people would just end the convo with, "Yeah, seems fun."

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:03.230
To be honest, I didn't think you'd actually play "Slippery Girls."

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:04.330
Sorry.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.560
Not to mention, you drew her outfit down to the very last detail.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.750
You're way more in the know than I am.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.020
So... well, you know.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.340
I just wanted to thank you.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.240
So thank you, Gojo-kun.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.920
Not to mention, the only way I can really help is to empty out my wallet.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.480
Th-That's not...

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.940
Seriously, this meat roll is super tasty.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.390
Here, have a bite, Gojo-kun.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.780
Here. Come on.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.640
A-An indirect kiss!

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.680
No, really! I'm super full!

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.870
You've treated me more than enough!

00:20:55.870 --> 00:21:00.890
Okay... I'm sorry... It's so tasty, though.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.410
Did you just think, "Man, she totally pigs out"?

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.620
No, I didn't... Your face!

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.890
You totally did! I'm not gonna get fat from just this!

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.470
My size won't change, so it's fine! Totally fine!

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.830
I didn't think that! Really! I didn't!

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.680
Also, I can't get full unless I eat rice! Got it?!

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.890
Yes! Loud and clear!

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.400
Whatever. I'm going to be careful until the event.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.850
I promise I'll still be able to wear the cosplay.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.210
Oh, right. When is this event?

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.650
Hm? Let's see...

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.340
Oh, found it. There's one in exactly two weeks.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.200
Oh, crap!

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.160
Sorry! I'm gonna miss my train, so I'm gonna go!

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.530
Thanks for everything today!
