00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.840
I'm home.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.440
Gojo Dolls Hello!

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.640
Yuzawaya Does this take care of all the shopping?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.520
Yes!

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.860
Also, the mannequin I ordered will be arriving today.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.970
For real? I'm super excited!

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.240
The World's Hobby Shop Oh, hey, Gojo-kun...

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.510
How's this?

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.800
Dude, you totally screamed.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.960
Don't scare me like that.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.260
B-B-But you suddenly... sh-showed me your underwear—

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.340
It's a swimsuit. I bought it earlier and just wore it out of the store.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.670
This part
I think we can use a swimsuit. Are there swimsuits that sit that high above the hips?
You mean a high-waisted swimsuit?
I totally have one One sec
Also, when we were talking about the outfit yesterday,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.050
I sent you a pic, which you totally saw, but you never replied.

It looks like this It's not quite right though, huh?

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.390
Let's go look at swimsuits tomorrow Read Read

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.390
What's with that? It was so rude.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.260
Harumph W-Well...

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.390
A lot happened after I saw that photo...

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.380
I had such a hard time finding any high-waisted ones.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.400
I finally found an imported one. Isn't it awesome?

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.360
Gojo-kun?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.070
U-Um... If you could just...

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.040
Leave me alone for a bit.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.320
Squee~

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.210
What's this? Could it be?

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.700
Are you excited?

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.330
Oh, Gojo-kun, you little perv—

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.930
I'm sorry! The swimsuit is fine!

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.170
Just, please! Do not! Touch me right now!

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.280
Wait, are you mad? My bad.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.190
I'm not mad... Just please, leave me be for now...

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.990
This is totally random, but do you ever blow on cold noodles to cool them off?

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.920
Yes.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.690
Ahaha
Isn't it like, totally embarrassing when you realize it?

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.160
This turned out super nice!

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.870
I'm so happy right now.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.340
You seem very happy.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.240
Of course I am!

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.670
It feels so nice when you feel like you're actually being useful.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.910
I mean, getting all up in my feels just for painting this thing is a bit much, but...

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
So I... was actually useful.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.060
It's so frickin' pretty! I'm even more hyped for this cosplay now!

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.930
Maybe I'll try it on.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.560
Wait, Kitagawa-san!

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.190
I totally don't mind you watching.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.360
I-I absolutely will not! What are you talking about?!

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.450
I've got a fancy bra on today, so I totes don't mind.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.270
Lookie!

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.990
That was deffo not the one I wanted to show off...

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Episode 9
A Lot Happened After I Saw That Photo

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.970
Gojo Dolls So effing cute.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.550
How is it, Inui-san?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.070
It's amazing.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.050
It fits me perfectly. It's gorgeous.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.540
So precious... Is it hard to move around in at all?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.220
No, it's fine.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.170
If there's anything you're not satisfied with, please let me know.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.440
Well...

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.030
The skirt could be poofier.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
Ask Inui-san.
Make all the decorations on the cap gold.
Upper arm 23 cm Use a fabric that'll stretch easily.
Military uniform base. Outlines her figure well.
Think about how the fabric fits around her arms and hips.
Add a crease to accent her eyelids
Put on 6 buttons.
Waist 55 cm
Use cosplay tape to make her eyes narrower
Add eyeliner to make her eyes more beautiful.
Light blue color contacts
Oh, you're right. Should we try putting in some wiring?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.830
I think we'll be fine if I just wear a firm tutu underneath. I have one.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.920
All right.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.950
Would you like to try the cape, too?

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:37.600
Yes.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.850
I wanna see!

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.070
You used embossed fabric for the lining.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.170
It's beautiful.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.700
The only thing is this fabric is a bit thick, so it might be harder to pose in.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.840
It's fine.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.110
If we take multiple shots while I'm moving, it'll look like it's waving, too.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.940
The heavier fabric will actually look nicer.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.260
She sounds super cool! I wish I sounded like I actually knew what I was talking about!

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.780
How's yours, Kitagawa-san?

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.780
Uh, yup.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.870
Um, uh... This part is like squeeze, and...

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.660
It's insane!

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.910
The thingies on my shoulders are cool, too, and...

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.080
mega insane!

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.580
And this part is too cute, and...

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.420
It's super-duper insane!

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.770
Blush You don't have to push yourself.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.670
Thank you so much.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.680
Kitagawa-san, I'd like to do your makeup and have you put your wig on, too,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.060
so let's get your hair up.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.220
Okay!

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.110
Marin Kitagawa.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.110
Is this the only shade of foundation you have?

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.770
Yes.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.360
If you choose a tone that's one shade lighter

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.490
when you're wearing a light wig, it'll match better.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.200
Use some color-correcting makeup, too.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:54.160
Juju-sama's makeup tutorial Base layer

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.970
I think blue might work well for Black Lobelia.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:54.160
Purple or blue color-corrector

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.120
This will make your skin look even lighter

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.000
She is an enemy, after all.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.160
Foundation

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.940
If you don't have any, you can use mine for the shoot.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.160
Really? That'd be super awesome!
This will make you skin look even lig

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.640
All right, let's change the shape of your eyes.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.410
Wait, what?!

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.160
We'll use cosplay tape.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.960
Inui-san told me about it, so I bought some.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:09.550
We want to turn this

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.300
I didn't think fake eyelashes would accurately depict Black Lobelia's sharper eye shape.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.900
into this Also, I was curious to see how it worked.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.550
Noice. Let's give it a shot!

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.890
Take the corner of the eye and lift up gradually diagonally.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.050
Like this?

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.720
This feels weird.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.740
Once you apply it, use bobby pins to keep the wig cap and tape in place.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.560
And my eyebrows?
Should I shave 'em off?

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.850
This time, your eyebrows should be even, so you don't have to.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.070
Wait, you shaved them totally off last time?

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.770
We're done.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.490
Yeah, looks good.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.310
Good job. Hey, hand me a mirror.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.770
Sure, here you go.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.630
Holy... crap! Does my face always look like this?!

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.440
I... Have I... Have I always been Black Lobelia?!

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.470
No, you dummy.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.850
That wig's a great color. Where's it from?

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.690
Swallowtail! It really is beautiful.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.900
Flinch Bonk Bonk Bonk Bonk Bonk Bonk

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.900
You seem really happy.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.800
Beaming I'm even more hyped now!

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.360
I can't wait until our group cosplay!

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.580
Gloom I was so looking forward to it... Fukudaya

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.430
Sudden rainstorms are common this time of year. It happens.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.580
It's cooler and darker now, and this fits the image more, so it's fine.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.710
I know, but it just brings down the mood, you know?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.930
That corset is really nice.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.130
I love Black Lobelia's outfit.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.120
You totally get it!

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.930
Corsets just kinda rule, don't they?

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.930
Maybe also 'cause it looks kinda like a dress.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.690
And it's ruffly but still Gothic.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.720
Ever since I was a kid, I loved the difference between Neon-oneetama and Black Lobelia.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.190
So I'm super stoked to be cosplaying her!

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.280
Yeah... Actually... I have a request.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.120
What?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.400
Fidget Fidget Um...

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.500
Could we get a picture t-together... maybe?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.140
Sure, whatever.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.590
For real?! Yay! You're the best!

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.800
Right in the feels...

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.010
Thank you so much... I can't right now...

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.330
Is it okay if I tweet this?

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.800
Sure... But your makeup's running.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.980
Shinju sure is late.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.310
It usually doesn't take her this long to get ready.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.230
I'll go check on her Gojo-kun's not back yet, either.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.650
Ohmigod, I'm getting so many likes!

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.670
My photos barely ever get any!

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.020
Juju-sama, you're too amazing! I can't!

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.920
That's because you usually only upload pictures of your meals.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.840
What's with the pics of fried rice with all kinds of stuff on it?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.330
Oh, that's my cooking.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.370
You must be kidding.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.580
I'm getting a ton of replies! "Wow, Juju actually exists."

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.430
Of course I do! What the hell?

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.330
Well, you never go to cosplay events, Juju-sama.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.270
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.010
Heya, what took you so long—

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.340
Huh?!

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.410
Wait...

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.270
Wait, Inui-san?

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.020
What's wrong? Inui-san?!

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.550
Inui-san!

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.120
Scouting (Location Hunting) Day I'm so sorry.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:18.240
Gloom

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.240
I'm the one who wanted to go, and I ended up fainting.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.490
Oh, no worries! Shinju-chan and I managed to check the whole place out.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.140
Yes.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.710
I took pictures, so we can look at them together when we get home.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.000
Okay... I guess you weren't feeling well.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.380
I'm sorry I didn't realize it sooner.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.130
I-I feel just fine...

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.280
Then can we call it a day?

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.350
That's a good idea.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.240
Okay.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.730
I have plans with Nowa and the others in Shibuya, so I'll see you guys later.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.940
Finals are coming up, so we're gonna get hyped at karaoke.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.520
Just study like normal people.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.360
See you, Gojo-kun!

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.190
Yes.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.440
We should get going, too.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.430
This is my first time at Shim-Misato,

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.850
so do you mind if I browse the shops by the station first?

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.450
Okay, I'm going to head home first, then.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.760
Be careful.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.640
Okay.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.020
Um...

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.260
Is something wrong?

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.570
Did you have another question about the camera?

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.460
Oh, n-no...

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.130
If I've got the wrong idea, I apologize in advance.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.100
But, um...

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:24.960
Did you actually want to cosplay, too, Inui-san?

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.590
When we first met the other day,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.400
I wondered if it was hard to say so in front of your sister.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.850
I'm sorry! I m-must've had the wrong idea!

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.290
Please forget I ever said anything. I'll be going now!

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.530
I-I would like to try it, actually...

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.830
I have a character that I love very much, so I'd love to try...

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.900
Just like Marin-san said,

00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:00.500
I've been jealous, watching my sister cosplay.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.760
Then... But... I just can't!

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.520
I'd... never look good as this character.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.450
I'm not cute like my sister.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:18.440
I'm not skinny, and this character is completely different from me.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:23.730
I can't be like that... I'd end up looking weird.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.850
So I shouldn't even try.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.700
And...

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.190
If I ended up doing a weird cosplay, and upset my sister...

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.880
I don't know what I'd do if she hated me!

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.020
I'm too scared...

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.770
The other day...

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.770
I saw so many cosplayers enjoying cosplaying for the first time...

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.550
And thought that the best thing about cosplay is that you can be anything that you want.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.570
If you feel like trying it, even just a little,

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.200
you should definitely cosplay!

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.450
I'll help you.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:11.620
And I'm pretty sure your sister would never judge you, Inui-san.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.880
Gojo-san, please... Please help me!

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.510
Yes, of course!

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.100
So, what series did you want to cosplay from?

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.930
Well, actually...

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.140
I also want to cosplay a character from "Flower Princess Blaze!!"

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.600
Fidget Fidget Oh, I see!

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.540
I wonder who she wants to be?

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.150
She said it was someone different from her, so maybe it's the heroine, Mirai-chan.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.360
I...

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.070
want to be Soma-oniichan.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.910
Soma-oniichan?

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.370
I've always looked up to Soma-oniichan so much.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.570
He's so strong and cool.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.410
And whenever his little sister Mirai-chan is in trouble, he's always there to help her out.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.860
Soft...
He reminds me so much of my sister, I love him.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.460
I see...

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.080
While we're at it, why don't you join their cosplay group on the shoot day?

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.820
I'm sure they'd both be very happy.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.110
S-Sure!

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.470
B-But could you keep this a secret until the day of?

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.690
This is my first time, so I'm a bit embarrassed.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:12.770
All right.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.000
Um... Do you really think I can pull it off?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.270
What do you mean?

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:22.780
I'm f-f-fat... so I have a hard time fitting in some clothes...

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.400
I wouldn't really call that "fat"...

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:30.030
And I only have my allowance, so I don't have much money...

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.900
That's right! She looks so much older, I forgot!

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.540
She's in middle school, so she can't work a part-time job yet!

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.800
That's going to be rough. I won't be able to make a costume...

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.420
N-No. Cosplay can definitely be an expensive hobby,

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.560
but it's not like everyone has a lot of money to spare.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.390
They should be able to enjoy it even with limited funds.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.550
There has to be a way.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.220
Think... Think!

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.610
O-Of course, it must be too difficult... No!

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.400
I'll definitely figure it out!

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.690
Gojo Dolls First, let's start with the outfit.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.740
Right...

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.410
If we use this uniform for your outfit, we won't have to buy one.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.160
Is this your uniform, Gojo-san?

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:20.330
Please adopt me

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.910
I remembered a thought I had while watching "Flower Princess Blaze!!"

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.520
Soma-oniichan and Sakuya's uniform looks like the one from my school.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.830
It really does!

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.670
Is it really okay to borrow it?

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.420
Yes.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.130
I'm not sure if it'll fit you, but...

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.060
Hup.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.010
If Kitagawa-san had been the one who wanted to cosplay Soma-oniichan...

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.180
Dude, this is huge on me Dude, this is huge on me!

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.730
W-Would I have lent her my uniform?

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.750
Gojo-san! I did it!

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.520
Flinch Okay!

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.340
How does it—
Yikes!

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:49.240
Gonna Burst Tight Shake Shake Tight Shake

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.490
Boom!

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.080
I-I-I-I'm so sorry about the buttons!

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:02.180
Awawawa Inui-san, your front! Your front!

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.730
Sad I'm so sorry...

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.460
Oh, no problem. I can sew this back on in no time.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.020
The size seemed about right, though.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.860
A little hemming should do the trick.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.010
Yes. I'll be rolling up the sleeves, so the length was perfect, too.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.140
So, the only problem is your che—

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.030
I-I mean, how to make you look like you have a guy's physique.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.900
Right...

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.290
At this rate, she'd just be wearing a guy's uniform.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.710
I guess we'll have to somehow make her chest stand out less

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.070
and somehow make her look like a guy...

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.170
Hina dolls wouldn't have this problem...

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.700
They also wear a kimono, so there aren't any buttons.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.080
Kimono... That's it!

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.170
Ta-da!
Let's try a sarashi wrap!

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:49.510
Not having cleavage would help a lot

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.790
If we use a sarashi to give you a more even shape,

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.320
I think we can make you look more like a guy.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.680
How about we give it a try?

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.510
All right.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.660
Come to think of it, Kitagawa-san wore two NuBras...

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.290
Changing how your face and body look just to look like a character

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.060
is actually pretty amazing...

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.150
But But...

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.520
It's basically the ultimate form of love!

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.360
I love her, so I want to be her!

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:19.290
I think it's because they love these characters so much that they're able to do this.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.880
My stomach doesn't stand out as much anymore,

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.930
but my chest still—

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.970
Right...

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.280
Also, that shirt still eventuates your curves, showing your girlish figure,

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.770
so we'll have to adjust the shoulders, too.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.680
Soma-oniichan is really athletic, so I'd like to make him look strong.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.900
Kyudo Club
I understand. We should make your shoulders broader somehow.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.220
More than anything, we have to do something about her chest.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.430
How did the people who were dressed as guys at the event handle this?

Hello, I hope you don't mind me answering. I'd recommend a B Holder. I also had a hard time getting my chest small enough when I would cosplay guys, but after using a B Holder and some taping, I managed to get the physique I was going for. I would recommend you give that a shot.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.120
Hm? A B holder?

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.870
I wonder what that is.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:07.750
Chest flattener with hooks
Undergarment that will help flatten the volume of your chest when cross-dressing, cosplaying, or wearing formal clothes. For B~H cups. It can almost completely flatten your chest.
*"B Holder" is a registered trademark of LBeRoad.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.640
Wow, it changes this much?!

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.170
They have my size, too!

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.100
But something this amazing must be really expensive—

This! This is it!

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.680
We can actually adjust your body shape at this price!

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.680
Yes! I'll buy it right now!

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.530
Now we just have to get you a wig.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:24.060
I'd like to buy it when I go shopping next, so may I measure your head circumference?

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:24.980
Sure, of course.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.500
Please look straight forward, and sit up straight...

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.730

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.820
Gojo Dolls I-I'm so sorry! That wasn't on purpose!

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.710
I-It's... It's okay! I'm so sorry!

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.610
Sorry to have you come all this way when you live so far away.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:48.540
It's fine.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.130
I bought your wig.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.760

Your cosplay is a secret, so let's go ahead and cut it ourselves.
Section off the hair

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.760
Don't try to cut everything at once to make sure it's all balanced

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.760
Set with hairspray Complete

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.960
Amazing...

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.770
This is his first time, and he's showing no hesitation at all.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.450
...Ghh.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.790
This sure is nerve-racking.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.790
Blank

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.100
It's hard to cut when I know I can't mess up.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.990
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.040
I was just relieved that you feel like that sometimes, too.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.700
O-Of course I do!

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.390
You make such amazing outfits, Look

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.730
so I thought you were super talented and could do anything.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.240
Oh, no! There's so much that I can't do!

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.920
Even now, I'm trying to figure things out.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.690
Really?

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.150
There's someone who I really look up to in my class.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.480
She's a ray of sunshine, loved by everyone around her.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.370
She's incredibly strong and able to say whatever's on her mind.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.710
I figured that she didn't have troubles like I did.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.310
But then, one thing led to another,

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.920
and I ended up spending a lot of time with her, and I found out...

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.740
She also had things she wanted to do but couldn't...

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.340
Things didn't always go her way.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.180
She even messed up at times.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.350
She has the same feelings I do...

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.770
She was just so happy...

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.160
She can be really cute sometimes.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.440
Gasp

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.570
I-I didn't mean to make it sound like that!

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.420
Um... Wait... What was I trying to say?

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.570
Well...

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.920
We can't see what they're feeling inside,

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.080
but everyone has a lot going on.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.600
I'll continue to cut this.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.830
Everyone has a lot going on...

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.760
Is that how it is?

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.140
Let's do your makeup, too.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:14.650
Proud
Outfit: 0 yen B Holder: 3600 yen Wig: 1799 yen Color contacts: 1999 yen Makeup tools, shoulder pads, etc: About 2000 yen
Grand Total: 9500 yen Yay!!

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.910
I got all your makeup at a hundred-yen shop,

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.310
so the total for everything was under 10,000 yen.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.650
Thank you so much!

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.980
Next, let's do your eyes.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.390
To make your eyes look a little more manly,

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.100
we'll extend the eyeliner a bit.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.120
Lastly, we'll adjust the wig and...

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.410
This is...

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.240
Sh...

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.190
Shinju?

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.300
U-Um... You see...

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.800
I-I... also...

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.330
t-tried cosplaying...

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.060
You look amazing! Absolutely amazing! Seriously amazing!

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.920
I couldn't actually tell it was you, Shinju!
What she said, though!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.340
Holy crap, holy crap, I can't!

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.520
You actually look like the real Soma-kun!

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.770
I thought the real Soma-oniichan showed up for a sec and freaked!

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.230
Um... I can't believe it! Is this real? You're Shinju?!

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.230
Like, what?! He's actually here! The real deal is here!
Uh... I-I...

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.740
You really look wonderful! Absolutely lovely, Shinju!

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.030
You look so good!

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.410
Isn't this great?

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.220
Yes...

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:20.960
Hey, Shinju-chan!

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.000
How'd you... where'd your boobies go?!

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.220
It's a total mystery!

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.280
I bound my chest using a B Holder and a sarashi wrap.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.260
He also added shoulder pads.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.260
You have a girly face!

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.770
Girly?

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.900
You've got the powerful presence of a dude, but your smile is so girly,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.970
the difference is amazing!

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:37.930
Ohemgee, this is awesome!

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.000
I can't right now! Or rather...

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.460
Can I take a selfie with you?

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.530
Let's take one together!

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.900
Please!

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.760
Sure.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.010
H-Hey! Let's take one more! This time...

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.370
Er, we should get started before our time runs out...

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.820
Oh, right! It's 15,000 yen per hour! Shinju, get the camera...

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.090
R-Right!

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.560
That camera costs 190,000 yen... Oh, shit!

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.050
B-Be more careful, for crying out loud!
We're okay.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:40.060
Episode 10

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.470
Everyone Has A Lot Going On Next time.
