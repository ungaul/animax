Episode 12
My Dress-Up Darling

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.550
Thank you so much for teaching me how to do this, Gojo-kun.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.340
No problem.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.890
I wanted to confirm where the ribbons go, so it worked out.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.330
But I'm sorry to hear you didn't get to go to the festival with your dad.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.340
Well, he's not too sorry about it.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.400
He's the one who canceled on me.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.050
My homework? Nope, haven't done it yet.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.800
I mean, I still have two weeks of summer vacay left.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.360
What? No way! That's plenty of time!

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.410
What?! Wait, why aren't we going to the festival?! That makes no sense!

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.990
So yeah, that happened.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.050
I told him it'd totally be fine, but he wouldn't believe me.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.630
Ever since, he's been telling me to send him pictures as proof

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.820
and give daily updates.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.000
Who asks for that?! Hardass!

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.550
I've got less than zero motivation. I haven't gone to a single festival this year.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.400
Oh, yeah. Iwatsuki just had their fireworks festival yesterday.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.060
What?! Why didn't you invite me?!

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.910
Come on!

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.060
Well, you couldn't go because of your homework, right?

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.460
I mean... I booked a bunch of jobs.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.130
I totally forgot about my homework.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.810
Oh, I've been meaning to ask... What is your part-time job, Kitagawa-san?

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.780
Oh... This.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.600
K-Kitagawa-san?!

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.260
Kitagawa-san, you're in a magazine!

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.860
K-Kitagawa-san, are you a celebrity?!

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.280
I just model for magazines.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.420
I'm an amateur model.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.940
An amateur model?

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.880
An editor for that magazine was at the salon I usually go to,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.180
and asked me if I was interested, so I gave it a shot.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.710
I've just been doing more shoots than usual lately.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.560
Wow...

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.880
You look very different than usual in this, Kitagawa-san.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.650
Maybe 'cause I've got an actual makeup artist doing my face.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.570
Why have you been doing more shoots lately?

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.990
Oh, that's because...

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.770
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, sparkle!
I want that DSLR camera.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.370
Mama's gotta get that check.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.720
Oh...

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.480
Kitagawa-san's seriously planning on buying one of those mega-expensive cameras...

You like scary movies, Kitagawa-san?

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.860
I dunno if I actually "like" them, but part three of this movie's coming out soon,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.890
so I wanna check it out and see why it's so popular.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.910
Not to mention, it's summer.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.520
I don't usually watch horror films...

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.770
How scary are these, exactly?

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.440
I mean, it's just a movie, so it can't be that scary.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.360
No sweat!

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.290
What? A voicemail?

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.830

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.340
Why is this happening to me?!

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.310
N-N-No, stop! Stop!

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.650
Wow, what an ending!

That was a great movie!

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.150
Uh, it was okay, I guess? It wasn't scary at all...

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.170
There's actually a scene I'd like to watch once more.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.980
Do you mind if I rewind and watch it again?

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.040
Huh?! Why, though?!

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.030
I wonder how they made this fabric look so old.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.990
Do you think they're using contacts?

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.130
I-It's probably CG... This... and this!

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.750
I can learn so much from all of this!

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.660
English is donezo!

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.370
God, that was rough. If I had any math to do, I would've died.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.280
We do, though.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.940
I already did the drills.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.280
No way. I don't have any...

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.610
Plonk! And now, for our next question... D'oh...

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.360
Uh, I think...

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.620
I might've left them at school!

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.700
We got in trouble for not coming here in our uniforms.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.050
I'm super sorry I made you come with me.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.600
It's fine. It's on my way home, anyway.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.640
I'm glad you found your math drills.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.580
Yeah.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.970
But seriously, the school looks hella creepy after watching that movie.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.870
Not to mention our footsteps are echoing.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.980
If we got here any later, we would've been doing a full-on test of courage.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.610
Yikes... Yes.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.110
Oh, I need to buy some things to make dinner.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.430
I know. Would you like to join us for dinner?

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.490
Can I?

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.620
It's been way too long. I can't wait!

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.000
I'm pretty sure you've only been eating that fried rice of yours.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.370
Whatcha makin' tonight?

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.660
I was thinking cold somen noodles with some shrimp, onion, and mitsuba kakiage.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.170
F'real?! That sounds amazing!

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.950
You can even make kakiage? You've got mad skills, Gojo-kun.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.220
Fried foods are way too high-level for me.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.080
I don't have swimming class, so I've never gotten to go in.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.330
It's so huge up close!

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.990
Won't we get in trouble for coming up here when we're not on the swim team?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.600
I'm sure regular students are allowed up here.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.450
It looks so nice and cool!

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.300
I'mma dip my foot in.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.320
I really don't think you should!

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.940
No worries. It'll just be for a sec.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.080
Kitagawa-san!

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.450
Kitagawa-san!

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.780
Dude, I seriously thought I was a goner just now.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.110
You're telling me! Kitagawa-san, you can't swim?!

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.320
Nope, can't even float.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.700
Didn't you say you went to the beach with your friends around the beginning of the month?

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.990
Did you actually have fun?

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.570
You mean 'cause I can't swim?

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.610
Er, yes.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.540
Hm... I really don't mind.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.140
I basically go to eat, chat, and take pics,

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.250
so it's plenty fun.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.370
Oh, I see.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.750
Y'know...

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.680
I love when I'm sitting on the sand, listening to the waves,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.350
and watching the ocean get all sparkly from the sun reflecting off it.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.470
So I always wanna go, even if I can't swim.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.450
You think I'm a little nuts for loving the ocean so much when I can't swim?

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.060
What? Did I say something that hilarious?

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.890
No, no. I'm sorry.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.980
It's not nuts at all.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.180
Of course...

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.140
I feel the same.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.620
Even though I can't paint their faces well yet...

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.840
I absolutely love hina dolls.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.010
Yeah, exactly! That's what I mean.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.550
I'm pretty sure everyone feels the same way.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.690
Yes.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.800
But if you drown, you'll die, so please try to avoid that...

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.320
I promise I'll be more careful.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.360
Gojo-kun.
Yes?

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.060
I'm gonna try to find a festival that's still happening,

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.460
so if I do, wanna come with me?

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.660
Huh? What about your homework, though?

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.160
You've still got quite a bit to do.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.000
Oh, right.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.860
Uh... I'll finish the rest super fast!

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.670
Just help me with the parts I don't get!

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.350
Sure, of course.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:40.110
August I'm actually doing math. Praise me?

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.110
Good job!

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.230
I'm glad to hear Marin-chan managed to finish all her homework.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.040
Yeah.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.290
Okay, I'll see you later.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.490
Yup.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.110
Watch out for cars.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.880

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.240

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.810
There's so many people...

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.310
I had no idea it got this crowded.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.870
I finished my homework!!!
Now we can go to the festival So Happy
Okay, wanna meet up at the shrine entrance at 6PM?
Sure Oh, man... I'm so friggin' excited!!!

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.150
I'm looking forward to it, too Shrine

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.130
Even meeting up right now might be difficult.
Shrine

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.340
I wonder if Kitagawa-san made it okay...

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.360
Yay, I found you!

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.060
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.550
The crowds here are crazy, so I had a hard time getting through.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.260
I-It's fine...

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.110
Hey, you're wearing your jinbei!

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.040
I knew it'd look great on you! Noice!

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.200
And K-Kitagawa-san, you're wearing a yukata...

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.750
Yup!

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.000
I went all out and had someone do my hair and get me into this yukata.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.160
What's up?

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.960
Huh?!

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.940
Wait, lemme guess...

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.550
You're one of those guys who gets excited from seeing the nape of a girl's neck?

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.890
Yikes Wait, seriously?

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:34.060

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.650
Seven!

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.790
You were that excited about this?!

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.290
Specialty Candied Apples

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.590
They have candied apples, Gojo-kun!

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.390
I'm gonna dig right in.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.780
That's great.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.280
Ooh, okonomiyaki!

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.100
Huh?

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.640
Okonomiyaki Thanks!

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.540
This looks great, Kitagawa-san—

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.420
Gone Huh?!

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.280
Delicious Yakitori They have yakitori, too!

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.650
Step right up!

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.070
Right... I wonder how many I should get...

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.070
Th-This is, uh...

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.610
Grilled Squid Beef Steak Skewers Yum
Chicken Skin Gyoza Fried Chicken Okonomiyaki

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:28.870
Cotton Candy Chocolate Bananas Cotton Candy Shaved Ice

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.240
You bought so much...

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.960
I mean, that's pretty normal for two people, isn't it?

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.360
Let's go sit at the plaza and eat!

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.670
Thank you for waiting.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.600
The fireworks show will start momentarily.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.810
Shoot, let's hurry, Gojo-kun.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:53.890
Right.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.920
This is my first time coming down to the plaza to actually watch the fireworks.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.440
Wow, really?

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.780
You've never gone to the fireworks festival at Iwatsuki?

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.240
That's sort of a waste when you live so close, isn't it?

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.110
I can smell the gunpowder and smoke...

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.290
People cheering...

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:00.840
Seeing them so up close...

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.500
The sound resonates through your whole body.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.010
Last year, the year before, and even before that...

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.100
Every year, I'd be alone in my room...

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.770
Fireworks were just some loud, echoing noise I'd hear off in the distance.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.500
And yet, this year...

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.130
Nyah.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.440
Oh, God! Your tongue!

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.160
Do you know what's happened to it?!

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.260
It instantly turns into an cool color when you eat Blue Hawaii.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.640
And you still chose to eat it?!

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.460
Yup!

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.260
Nyah! Nyah! Nyah!
That's enough already!

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.010
Ow... Wow...

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.150
The straps really did a number on your feet.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.470
It must hurt to walk.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.380
There's a convenience store nearby, so I'll buy some bandages.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.310
It's fine.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.520
It'd be a pain for you to have to go and come back.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.120
But... Just take me with you.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.950
Take you with me?

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.450
We're so high up!

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.180
I envy you! You get to see everything from all the way up here.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.910
Sh-She smells so nice...

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.420
Gojo-kun! How tall are you?

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.760
A-A hundred and eighty....

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.510
Kitagawa-san! It's dangerous if you move too much!

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.010
Whoops, my bad.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.720
Wow, I figured you were about that tall.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.200
The last part of the fireworks was insane.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.720
They were very beautiful.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.540
It's kinda hilarious that you can't see them well, from all the smoke.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.550
I never knew it'd end up like that.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.900
I'm really glad I came.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.690
Me, too! Or, well...

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.030
It kinda sucks that this happened at the end.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.650
You're not used to wearing them, so it happens.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.630
But, y'know,

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.640
when this kinda crap happens, it doesn't matter how much fun you were having.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.830
Things get sorta "meh," right?

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.600
Sorry about this, Gojo-kun.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.730
I promise I'll be more careful next year.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.740
Next year, too?

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.650
Next year, let's go to Iwatsuki's fireworks festival, too.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.130
Yes, let's go.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.420
Actually, why don't we just hit up all the fireworks festivals in the Kanto region?

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.510
Really? Do you think we can actually do it?

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.450
Anything is possible if you try.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.780
Not that I'd know.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.520
I guess I'll call it a night.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.200
Kitagawa-san? Is everything okay?

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.080
Gojo-kun... What were you doing right now?

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.810
I was about to go to bed.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.510
It's pretty late. Did something happen?

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.080
Well... Not exactly...

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:25.010
I-I just wanted to hear your voice...

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.950
I'm way too scared to sleep right now!

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.610
On-Den: One Malicious Call 2

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:34.760
I ended up watching "On-Den 2"... Ah, the sequel.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.040
But didn't you say the other day that it wasn't scary?

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.130
Well, last time, you were with me, so I was mostly fine,

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.630
But I just can't by myself right now!

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.050
I'm scared to death at the littlest sounds!

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.160
I'd drop dead if someone was behind me, so I've been keeping my eyes open.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.460
I even washed my hair with my eyes open!

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.220
What? But I'm sure no one's there.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.290
That movie's fiction, after all.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.010
You don't know that! Maybe it's based on a real story that actually happened!

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.720
What if it's true?! What if I got a voicemail?!

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.220
I seriously can't right now!

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:23.230
It's super scary because it's a horror movie dealing with smartphones!

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.260
I'm losing my mind right now!

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.160
Gojo-kun.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.730
It doesn't have to be for long, but just keep talking to me.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.720
You can even put it on speaker and doze off on me!

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.320
A-All right.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.860
So, yeah...

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.140
Summer Vacation Homework Isn't Nowa super strong?

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.080
That girl is insane.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.320
I had no idea Sugaya-san was like that.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.570
Maybe I'm not so scared now.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.560
Thanks, Gojo-kun.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.960
Well, I'm glad...

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.890
Man, I guess school's starting back up tomorrow.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.520
Summer vacation was way too short.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.870
I have so much more that I wanna do.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:11.540
I wanna watch "PrezHost" again, and I wanted to work more...

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.880
And cosplay!

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.710
I wish we could've gone to at least one more cosplay event.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.350
There's seriously not enough time in a day.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:22.480
Marin Kitagawa Right... I... I...

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.380
Sounds like he's about to pass out.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.130
This year was really fun...

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.370
Yeah.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.140
We did a lot together this year...

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.400
and it was a lot of fun.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.610
Gojo-kun...

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:01.830
I love you.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.100
My dude's out like a light. What was even the point?

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.250
Guess I'll sleep, too.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.210
I'll talk to you later, Gojo-kun.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.220
Wakana Gojo

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.750
Goodnight.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.130
See you later.
