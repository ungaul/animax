00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.190
Gojo Dolls

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.400
I'll cosplay Neon-oneetama as Black Lobelia...

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.240
So let's do a Blaze!! group cosplay!

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.360
Not happening.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.850
A group cosplay?

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.360
Is that when they cosplay as different characters from the same series?

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.090
I just want to cosplay for myself and leave behind plenty of amazing photos.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.240
I have no plans to work with other cosplayers.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.750
Your photos are rather detailed.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.920
And since I'm cosplaying Black Lily this time, I was planning on renting a studio.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.420
A studio?!

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.350
Holy crap! I wanna see!

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.150
Do you mind if I come with you?!

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.060
I just told you, I'm not doing group cosplays.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.380
I'll split the studio fees with you!

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.460
Studio fees can get pretty expensive.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.850
Oh, really?

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.780
Then I'll pitch in, too.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.490
Why are you tagging along, too?

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.240
Kitagawa-san can't put fake eyelashes on herself, and I do her makeup, as well.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.850
Seriously? You're joking, right?

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.520
He's totally telling the truth.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.810
Unbelievable, am I right?

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.520
We're talking about you, here.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.010
Episode 7
A Home Date with the Guy I Wuv Is the Best

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.890
The studio fees... They're 15,000 yen an hour.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.060
If I end up splitting the cost, I can spend the rest on my outfits...

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.730
On my outfits...

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.690
Juju-sama, sorry for bothering you.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.120
You can totally ignore everything I just said.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.900
I'm definitely looking forward to your Black Lily photos!

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.720
I...

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.160
I-If you insist.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.000
I guess I'll let you tag along... just this once.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.630
Hell, yeah! A group cosplay with Juju-sama!

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.640
I-It's just this once! Just this one time, you hear me?!

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.160
Yay!

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.590
Hell, yeah!

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.270
Juju-sama's the best!
That's great.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.450
Then I guess I should watch this anime, too.
Yay!

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.260
Huh?!

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.540
You're going to start watching all of it now?!

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.270
Wouldn't reference photos be enough?

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.900
Well, I thought that at first, as well...

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.380
But I want to understand the material, and pick just the right fabric for the characters.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.380
I played all the way through Slippery Girls 1 and 2 last time.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.930
Right?
What?!

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.340
I was so moved.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.840
When the protagonist first enters the club room,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.190
the president was stark naked, and in her anu—

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.330
Hold up! Just stop! You don't need to tell me your thoughts on this!

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.090
This page is about the 2nd season of the anime series Flower Princess, called Flower Princess Blaze!!, produced by Toh-A Animation.

Flower Princess Blaze!!
Genre: Magical Girl
Let's see... Flower Princess Blaze!! already finished airing, right?

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.810
I need to look up how to watch it.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.760
I have the complete box set, so you can just borrow mine.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.220
Really? Thank you very much.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.930
Of course! It's so much fun, you can watch it in a snap.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.730
I mean, it's only 126 episodes!

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.730
126?!

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.530
I see, I see.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.450
Yeah, apparently the DVD set weighs a lot,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.620
so I'm going to go get it from Kitagawa-san's place.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.580
Sure, and don't worry about the shop.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.660
Go right ahead.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.300
I haven't had a chance to practice lately,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.150
s-so I probably did it poorly... I'm sure of it.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.670
Wakana.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.970
Yes, sir!

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.330
You've really improved.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.630
Huh? Really?

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.360
You betcha.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.420
Your lines used to be really stiff...

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.430
But now, they've softened a bit.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.650
You think so?

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.430
I can't really tell, myself.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.820
I think making that outfit for Marin-chan was good for you.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.040
You even did her makeup for her, didn't you?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.910
Yeah.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.550
I'm sure you were careful, thorough,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.260
and used all of your concentration just like you would when painting a doll's face.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.670
If you wanna be a great dollmaker in the future, you can't just look at dolls.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.630
You need to observe a lot of things.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.630
It'll all pay off someday.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.280
Yes, sir.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.820
Did I get here too early?

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.090
I'm pretty sure this is the time she said.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.330
I'm so sorry! I just woke up!

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.340
I started watching Blaze!! yesterday, and I just couldn't stop!

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.940
I'm so, so sorry!

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.380
Why don't we measure my bust point?

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.680
Let's go with 20 cm.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.800
Where can they be?

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.150
Gojo-kun?

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.840
You good?

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.650
I-I'm sorry!

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.740
Conasdjgoaidjf?!

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.400
I don't have my colored contacts in!

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.440
That's what you're worried about?

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.210
Sorry to keep you waiting. We're all good now.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.380
O-Okay.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.550
Th-Thanks for inviting me over.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.380
Come on in.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.090
Here you go, Kitagawa-san...

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.510
It's not much, but... No way!

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.490
You bought these for me?

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.370
Yes.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.500
I've been given them before, too.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.840
Thanks!

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.980
Hey, they're pudding. They look hella bomb.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.800
Well, that made my heart skip a beat.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.640
He's already seen me without makeup so I can't do anything about that...

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.820
But I can't handle not having my contacts in.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.180
Hey, these are from that shop that always has a line.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.780
Sweet!

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.490
Wh... Wh-Wh-What am I gonna do?!

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.680
Thinking on it, even if this is just to make her cosplay,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.760
I've never actually been to a friend's house.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.960
Not to mention... This is K-Kitagawa-san's house!

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.650
Oh, no... I'm so nervous, I'm gonna hurl.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.720
I need to hurry and get the DVDs from her and leave.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.470
Gojo-kun.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.700
Y-Yes?

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.980
You came all this way...

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.310
so why don't we watch the DVDs together?

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.690
Huh?! B-But why?!

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.590
Wouldn't they be easier to carry if you watched some here first?

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.900
B-But... Just come in, already.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.830
Th-Thank you for inviting me in.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.480
How did things end up like this?!

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.440
Oh, this is my room.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.860
Th-This is Kitagawa-san's room...

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.030
It's a little messy, but go ahead and sit wherever.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.970
P-Please excuse me.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.100
This is Tsukiyono ♥ Company~
Saint♥Slippery's Academy for Girls— The Young Ladies of the Humiliation Club: Debauched Miracle Life 2

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.970
Saint♥Slippery's Academy for Girls— The Young Ladies of the Humiliation Club: Debauched Miracle Life 2

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.970
Yeah. This is definitely your room, Kitagawa-san.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.050
Huh? Yeah, it is.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.660
Wakana's anxiety was gone in an instant.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.070
Dad... Mom...

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.020
Was I that much of a burden to you?

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.370
Would it have been better if I was never born?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.750
Neon...

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.140
I... I just wanted to be loved.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.230
Soma-kun...

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.190
Even Soma-kun didn't choose me...

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.100
Neon, no!

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.940
If you unleash any more darkness—

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:12.960
Neon...

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.970
Neon!

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.700
Neon-oneetama's appearance really seems to change once she becomes Black Lobelia.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.310
I know, right?

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.450
No... Is that you, Neon-oneechan?

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.800
Yes, Shion. It is I, Neon.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.050
But why, Neon-oneechan?

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.180
So Shion-tan also had no idea that was her sister, either.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.270
I see. So that's the Flower Jewel.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.910
It really is pitch black.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.510
Yeah, she's really gone off the deep end.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.690
Really hits you in the feels.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:12.890
No.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.410
Go away, Mirai.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.530
I don't want anything to do with the other Princesses.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.110
Get lost, sucker!

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.740
Do you see how cold she is to everyone other than Onee-tama?

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.040
She's so cute, I just can't.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.420
You say that happiness won't last forever, Shion-chan.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.750
But sad and painful things don't last forever, either!

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.920
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.770
You'll never understand!

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.040
You're just a cheerful little space cadet...

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.350
You could never understand how I feel!

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.790
This is a magical girl show, but they don't really use magic. They just punch each other.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.750
I wonder why... Ooh, here it comes, Gojo-kun!

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.850
There it is!

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.920
Are these the two that you mentioned before?

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.960
Yeah!

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.210
This is Shion-tan's crush, Sakuya-kun.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.470
And this is Mirai-taso's older brother, Soma-kun!

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.420
See? Do you see how close they are?

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.920
Yes.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.350
And they're both very handsome...

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.100
Their uniforms kind of look like ours, too.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.190
Wait, is this like a home date?

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.370
Meaning Wait, wait, wait, hold up!

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:46.910
One day in June. Marin Kitagawa invites classmate Wakana Gojo (15), who she has a crush on, into her room with the intent of lending him DVDs. However, before Marin Kitagawa even realized it herself, they magically ended up alone on the same sofa together. One could say they were having a "home date" in her bedroom watching DVDs together. She finds herself unable to contain her excitement as her heart beats even faster. A man and woman, alone together in a room, watching DVDs. Who knows what may or may not happen...?

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.250
It totally is! It has to be!

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.270
I mean, I mean, I mean, things have been different with Gramps around,

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.730
but right now... W-We're totally alone together.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.170
I wuv him.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.540
Wait, hold up... I'm having so much fun right now!

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.320
Dsj;gfhaslkn!

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.980
A home date with the guy I wuv is the best.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.860
This is, like, the best thing ever!

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.820
I don't want this moment to end...

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.900
Not so fast!

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.790
Gurgle...

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.670
Death

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.150
I guess you haven't eaten anything except pudding since you woke up.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.670
Mhm... Kill me now...

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.590
Well, would you like me to go buy you something?

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.120
Nope! I'll whip something up, so don't worry about it!

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.310
I can make some for you, too.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.480
Huh? Really?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.270
A homemade meal made by Kitagawa-san!

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.990
A homemade meal made by Kitagawa-san...

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.690
I'll make us something.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.450
Huh? No way.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.490
You cook for me all the time.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.140
Let me handle this.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:20.750
There we go.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.380
Let's see... What should I make?

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.000
Oh, oopsie.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.630
I forgot to put on a bra.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.110
Well, whatever.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.690
Not like he noticed, anyway.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:39.350
Veggies &amp; Fruit Sauce (Semi-Sweet)

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.780
Delicious Milk Soontory Natural Spring Water Lessee...

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.350
I have some eggs, onions... some chicken...

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.370
Hm, maybe I'll make omurice.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.210
Actually...

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.150
Am... Am I really doing this?

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.880
Holy crap, can you even imagine?!
Eat up, Gojo-kun!

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.660
That's so freakin' girly! How embarrassing!

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.660
Here, say, "Aah."

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.290
My face is burning up!

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.090
Hurry up and cook, you dummy!

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.300
Hup.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.720
Hup.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.480
Hiyah.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.920
Ugh, this sucks!

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.590
My eyes are burning.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.050
Ugh, what's with onions anyway?

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.310
The hell's your problem?

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.810
Hey, this looks pretty decent!

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.070
Ta-hay-sty!

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.160
Ohmigod, what is this? I'm, like, a genius!

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.600
Who knew making omurice was such a cinch?!

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:41.160
Hahahaha!

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.600
Now I just gotta wrap this baby up with an omelet!

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.160
Talk about easy!

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.380
Sorry

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.130
Thanks for cooking.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.030
Sure.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.180
Uh, so...

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:58.430
Th-Things were going pretty well for a while...

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.830
But I used up all my eggs, so I couldn't try again.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:03.980
So, uh...

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.520
N-Never mind! You don't have to eat it!

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.240
I'm so sorry!

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.820
Did you season this with anything other than salt and pepper?

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.860
Huh?

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.040
Y-Yeah...

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.330
It's got chicken stock and a little bit of soy sauce...

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.750
I see...

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.580
That's why it's so delicious.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.580
Huh?

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.070
I'd never thought about using those.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.350
It's very good.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:31.980
Huh?

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.090
You're not just being nice?

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.140
Huh? No, I mean it.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.140
Saint♥Slippery's Academy for Girls— The Young Ladies of the Humiliation Club: Debauched Miracle Life 2

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.140
It's really very good.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.280
Thank goodness.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.610
I guess I should eat, too.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.720
Yes.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.620
Here I go!

00:16:54.110 --> 00:17:03.620
Saint♥Slippery's Academy for Girls— The Young Ladies of the Humiliation Club: Debauched Miracle Life 2

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.090
We always eat Japanese food at home, so this is a nice change.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.990
I'll make some at home next time.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:05.400
Kitagawa-san must really love... Sorry ...fried rice.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.130
Fried Rice

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.050
Even if that's true... I'll continue to fight!

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.440
Because I'm a Flower Princess!

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.730
You can do it... You've got this!

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.900
Need some tissues, Gojo-kun?

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.520
Gojo Dolls Hello, this is Gojo.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.040
Did you have a chance to look at the multi-view sketch I sent?

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.740
Would you like me to make any revisions?

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.490
Nope. It's fine.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.500
Thank you very much.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.500
More importantly... Patent-leather shoes
This part in back. It might be better to get rid of it to prioritize mobility. Ask Inui-san.
Garter belt on the socks Make them black and have the socks match.
Inseam 71.5 cm
Wrists 12.5 cm Sew them onto the fabric? Make them detachable?
White gloves. See if she has any from previous cosplays.
Make sure the socks and shoes match.
5 cm heels
Make sure the hair coming out from the cap is well-balanced.
Make sure she can wear her cape over the outfit.
Should the wig we use be the one she already used for her Shion cosplay or a new one?
Waist 55 cm Put on 6 buttons
Neck height 9.5 cm. Make sure the collar doesn't hit her chin.
Should we just buy the hat from a store and adjust it? Ask Inui-san.
Make all the decorations on the cap gold.
Upper arm 23 cm Use a fabric that'll stretch easily.
Military uniform base. Outlines her figure well.
Make sure frilliness spreads out nicely.
Light blue color contacts
Use cosplay tape to make her eyes narrower
Shoe size 22 cm Foot width 8 cm Calves 30.8 cm
Make sure the buttons on her chest look nice
Ankles 18 cm Hips 79.2 cm
Make it tighter right above the skirt.
Make the buttons on her collar gold, too.
Sew on gold fabric for the trim, too.
Just like Shizuku-tan's outfit, make the skirt spread nicely. This time, we'll try using wires.
Add a crease to accent her eyelids
Think about how the fabric fits around her arms and hips.
The cap's brim. I'll talk to Inui-san about the length.
Create the crest Make sure it leaves an impression.
Add eyeliner to make her eyes more beautiful
Make the epaulettes gold, too 

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.020
Are your sketches always this detailed?

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.500
Yes, they are.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.850
I see... That's impressive.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.500
I'll go ahead and send you the funds for the fabric.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.830
How much do you think it'll cost?

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.100
Sorry, but...

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.760
I'm not quite sure yet, so could you wait until after it's completed?

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.190
I'll do my best to keep the cost down.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.000
Really?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.040
Okay, thanks.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.890
What did you want to do about hair and makeup?

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.500
You don't need to worry about that.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.870
I can do that myself.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.240
All right.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.900
By the way, I went through all of your cosplay photos, Inui-san.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.540
All of them... eh?

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.510
Yes.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.660
I know it's possible to change the width of your eyelids,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.380
but there seem to be some pictures where your eyes look completely different.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.370
How do you pull that off?

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.410
Oh, I use tape.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.040
Tape?

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.080
Can you take a look at your phone screen a sec?

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.760
Can you see me?

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.410
Yes, I can.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.130
I use this.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.830
You can change the shape of your eyes using cosplay tape.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.560
For example, to make them look bigger,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.920
tape the area right above your eyes,

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.810
or mid-forehead to the back of your head.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.440
If you use tape to keep your eyes like this,

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.020
you can change their shape a bit.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.650
Wow...

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.030
You can even do an impromptu facelift or make your jawline sharper.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.940
You can narrow your eyes, make them more slanted,

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.600
or you can also make them droopy.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.440
If we had used that, we could've made Shizuku-tan look more droopy-eyed.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.840
This is really informative!

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.660
You didn't know any of this before?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.750
Yes.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.580
That cosplay was my first experience.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.840
Y-You're kidding, right?

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.990
Y-You mean, that outfit was your first time making one?

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.310
Yes.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.500
As you can see, there's so much I need to work on.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.770
So that's why Marin Kitagawa's cosplay photos were taken on a smartphone

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.970
rather than a camera...

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.940
You're just so...

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.260
Okay.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.600
We'll go ahead and take the group cosplay photos with our camera.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.830
Our?

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.460
Oh, I didn't mention this earlier?

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.200
My younger sister takes my photos.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.530
Oh, I see.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.760
Your sister is a very good photographer.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.420
The backgrounds really sparkle.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.860
Well, we touch them up with photo-editing software.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.190
You can touch up your skin and even change the color of your eyes.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.630
That's quite amazing.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.620
You guys should totally invest in a camera, too.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.550
Um, Inui-san... What?

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.200
If it's not too much trouble,

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.960
could your little sister show me how to properly use a camera?

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.760
There's so much I don't know yet.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.140
Sure... But she's still in middle school,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.130
and if we go to your place, we won't get home until late.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.980
In that case, I'll meet you somewhere.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.870
All right.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.920
Will a family restaurant near my place work, then?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.530
Yes, that's perfectly fine.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.290
I'll contact you again later.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.210
Sure.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:26.770
Thank you very much.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.070
A camera, huh...

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.940
Come to think of it, there were a lot of people with nice cameras at the event we went to.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.450
...photos. I'm also asking if her little sister will show me how to properly use a camera.
Thanks!

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.620
Inui-san's younger sister will be joining us on the day of the photoshoot. Apparently Inui-san's younger sister takes her photos. I'm also asking if her little sister will show me how to properly use a camera. 
Today

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.590
Y-Yes, hello?

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.180
I'll come with you!

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.290
I wanna learn how to use a camera, too!

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.610
A-All right.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.300
I'll ask Inui-san.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.600
Thanks, bud!

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.150
Marin!

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.140
I'm so hungry, I'm gonna drop dead any second here.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.280
Sorry, Nowa!

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.810
Go ahead to the restaurant.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:57.940
Okay...

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.280
Aw, Juju-sama has a little sister!

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.780
She's probably the spitting image of Juju-sama, but tinier,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.480
and stupidly adorable.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.550
Hewwo I agree.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.130
I can just picture her.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.040
I'm so freakin' excited now!

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.860
I-I-It's very nice to meet you...

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.320
Come on. You're slouching again.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.550
O-Okay...

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.080
Sorry, she's a bit nervous.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.630
I... I'm Shinju Inui!

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.560
I-It's... It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance!

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.920
Sh-She's not exactly what I imagined, but more importantly...

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.420
She's in middle school?!

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.670
Y-You're that huge in middle school?!

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.010
Holy crap!

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.200
Just how big are you?!
