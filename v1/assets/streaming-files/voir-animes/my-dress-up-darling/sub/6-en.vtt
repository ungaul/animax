00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.020
Right...

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.840
Kitagawa-san, you were very beautiful.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.830
Huh?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.450
Huh?

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.950
Huh?

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.650
Huh...?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.960
Episode 6
For Real?!

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.340
Gojo Dolls Um, are you sure about this?

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.780
I can do it.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.190
Yup! It's totes fine.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.080
I'm the one who wore it, so I should wash it, too.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.290
All right. Thank you very much.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.490
First, let's wash the wig.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.770
'Kay.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.570
"Pour fabric softener into cold or warm water,"

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.900
Lonoa Eliminates Odors
"and then, gently wash a wig that's been combed through by pressing on it."

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.100
L-Like this?

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.780
Yes.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.760
"Rubbing it against the bottom or squeezing too much will damage it, so please take care."

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.970
"Next, change out the water and continue to press on it,"

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.940
"place it inside a towel to get rid of any moisture,"

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.040
"then lastly, let it dry in the shade, and you're done."

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.500
Oh, sweet. That's super easy.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.130
I figured it'd be way harder—

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.510
"Outfits will get sweat stains, so let's wash those by hand, too..." I see.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.740
Oh, apparently washing your wig too often isn't good for it, either.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.380
Huh?

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.300
Seriously?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.570
That's why you fell over?

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.690
Whaddya mean? They were ladies' undergarments!

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.460
They were stockings, right?

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.740
That's no big deal at all.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.150
Wacchan's a high school boy.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.600
It's not unusual for him to have a pair or two.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.620
Is that so?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.550
I'm home.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.300
Oh hey, Gramps. Welcome home.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.890
Sorry for being away from the shop for two weeks.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.830
Hiya!

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.400
Wakana!

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.480
Ketopro Tape External Medicine - 7 Strips Kaoru Gojo

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.120
Ah, I see.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.860
So that's all.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.100
Sorry for raising my voice like that, Marin-chan.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.910
No worries at all!

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.440
I just thought...

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.620
We didn't do anything inappropriate.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.270
Yeah, I can see that, looking at this.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.320
Still, I'm impressed you made this. It's some fine work.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.040
I've still got a lot to work on, though.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.410
You think so? It looks fine to me.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.890
I mean, like here and here.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.710
I almost ended up using glue like I usually do.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.500
Ah, yeah. I can see why.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.710
Definitely a different beast than hina dolls, though.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.650
Yeah.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.280
There are so many curved lines, This is just...

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.160
so I couldn't figure out how to get the right shape.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.580
Oh, this part, too.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.300
Ah, I see.
Oh, shit...

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.870
I guess you usually deal with straight lines.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.040
Badump Badump Badump Badump
Oh, shit! I'm totally head over heels for Gojo-kun!

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.540
Huh? What?! No way, what?!

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.150
I like him? Do I like love him?!

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.940
Like wuv him?!

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.380
But oh, my God! He talks so much with his grandpa!

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.820
Wait, no I seriously can't. Wait, wait, wait...

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.470
He's so freakin' adorable!

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.440
Oh, my God!

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.390
I wuv Gojo-kun!

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.140
Man, this is exhausting!

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.750
Like, what am I going to do?!

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.070
I seriously can't right now!

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.740
Gurgle...

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.860
Are you hungry, Kitagawa-san?

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.600
Uh—

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.660
Death Kill me now!

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.280
Wanna have dinner at our place?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.050
Huh?

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.010
Yeah, you're already here, so you should stay.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.540
Huh? Uh...

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.880
Let's eat!

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.400
So good! Gojo-kun, you can cook, too? Dude, you're a god!

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.920
It's not a big deal. My parents are gone, so I just do all the cooking.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.060
It's not that impressive.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.280
For real? Guess you're like me, then.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.200
Huh?

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.940
Well, my mom got sick and died a while ago, so I was living alone with my dad.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.250
But when I got into high school, he had to transfer for his job.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.000
He's away for work, so I basically live by myself.
Sorry, Marin!

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.740
Oh, this kabocha squash is good, too!

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.370
That must be rough.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.090
You getting proper meals?

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.840
Yup!

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.840
Mostly from the convenience store,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.920
but when I'm not working, I cook for myself.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.530
This is natto and frozen fried rice topped with some frozen fried chicken and wieners.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.430
Greasy... Mushy...

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.430
I got so hooked on this before that it's all I ate for a while.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.510
Believe it or not, I can cook and stuff.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.470
Are you really okay?

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.010
You sure your body's holdin' up okay?

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.940
Totally!

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.400
Rich Coffee Milk Rich Mango Yogurt
I even drink milk and eat yogurt every day,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.150
so I'm totes fine!

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.800
Marin-chan, why not come over here for dinner from now on?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.120
You don't mind, do you, Wakana?

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.120
Uh, sure.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.510
Let's do that, Kitagawa-san.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.940
Really? You don't mind?!

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.030
Score!

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.070
Thanks for walking me to the station, Gojo-kun.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.760
It's no problem.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.760
Sorry to keep you out so late.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.960
Oh, no worries!

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.000
Dinner was yummy and I had lots of fun talking to your grandpa.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.750
Gojo-kun!

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.280
Yes?

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.660
I'll...

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.500
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.740
Sure.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.650
See ya!

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.020
Huh? What even was that?

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.220
That was a totally normal conversation.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.770
Why can't I pull myself together?

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.070
We didn't do anything inappropriate.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.840
"Anything inappropriate," huh?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.840
What if we did, though?

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.550
And what if I actually said that?

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.440
Of course, it starts pouring right when I decide to go out, for cryin' out loud.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.280
A student at our shop all by herself?

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.080
Is she a friend of Wakana's?

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.800
You okay there, Missy?

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.820
I'm home.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.190
Welcome back.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.810
I'mma head out for a bit.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.410
And you've got a friend waiting for you.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.210
Huh?

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.860
Poor thing was soaked to the bone,

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.200
so I offered our bath.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.430
Make sure you prep your friend something to drink, too.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.620
Gramps...

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.300
Who did you let into the house?

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.710
Kitagawa-san said she had work today,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.940
and I don't have a friend other than her.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.190
Oh, no!

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.190
Are they a con artist? A new-age burglary scheme?

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.920
Did they pull one over on him?!

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.710
Huh? A kid?

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.600
Hey—

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.890
Hey, Gramps.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.640
Why doesn't this hina doll have any hair?

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:32.330
Ah, that's because we do their face and hair separately.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.930
We draw her face, then apply her hair.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.650
Oh, I see!

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.250
That's why she's so silky smooth!

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.810
...silky smooth!

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.740
I...

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:07.930
I-I am so sorry... Wh-What brings you here today?

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.210
Th-The outfits.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.940
You're the one making them, right?

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.480
Oh, I see!

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.850
She's here to see how hina dolls are made.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.110
I see!

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.370
She's by herself, so Gramps must've assumed that she was my friend.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.380
Yes, I am!

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.940
Just a moment, please.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.500
Okay, could I get your name and your school's name?

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.940
Sajuna Inui.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.380
I'm a second-year at Sakuranomiya Girls' High School.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.210
O-Oh, she's older than me... What?

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.010
Oh, it's nothing.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.770
Happy Kids!! 100% Apple Juice And you?

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.240
My name is Wakana Gojo.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.580
I'm a first-year in high school.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.650
Um, if you wanted to see the outfits, we can see them right away.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.870
Just some of them, though.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.180
Wait, really?!

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.660
I wanna see 'em right away!

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.490
Sure!

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.680
Here you go!

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.910
Take as much time as you'd like.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.330
It really does make me happy when people are so interested in hina dolls.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.380
Those dolls...

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.210
They don't have heads.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.770
Oh, their heads are right over there.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.690
They're made separately and combined later.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.970
That's a bit... grotesque.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.800
Oh, whoa. This kimono has Swarovski crystals.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.550
That one has lace.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.910
I guess these are pretty different, now.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:38.760
Yes!

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.200
We do make some modern ones to keep up with the times.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.990
Can I take a closer look?

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.780
Go right ahead.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.860
Oh, don't worry. I won't touch them.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.600
I'm sure they're quite valuable.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.540
Your consideration is much appreciated.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.570
They're so pretty and lovely.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.540
I really like these.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.840
You have a great eye!

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.580
Those are quite popular!

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.860
I knew it!

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.300
They totally catch your eye! How strange!

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.820
They're so beautiful that I love them, too.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.560
Oh, and these dolls over here—

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.950
Why are we looking at hina dolls?

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.980
Because this is a hina doll shop... I know that!

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.150
But I was talking about cosplay outfits!

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.760
This one!

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.450
You made it, right?

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.620
I came here to order a cosplay from you!

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.210
O-Order?

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.810
I'm not making cosplay outfits as a business, though...

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.990
You saw... didn't you?

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.710
Huh?

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.920
E-Earlier in the bathroom... Y-You saw my...

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.430
Voyeurism... Yeah, you're a peeping Tom!

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.880
If I report you, you're gonna get arrested!

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.840
Huh? W-Wait!

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.170
No one else has ever seen me like that...

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.690
Wakana Gojo.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.960
If you don't want the police to find out...

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.950
You will make me, Juju, an outfit!

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.380
Huh?

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.690
Juju?

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:23.000
I love her so much!

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.520
Juju...

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.140
is the cosplayer that Kitagawa-san said she liked...

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.860
Is that really her?

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.130
She looks very young.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.030
How old do you think she is?

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.280
Hm... Maybe in middle school?

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.700
She might even be in grade school.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.360
Huh?

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.330
I'm so sorry.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.230
About what?

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.760
So, um... What brings you here, Juju-san?

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.690
How did you find out where I lived?

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.480
Huh?

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.490
Well, uh...

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.500
That Marine girl's cosplay photo was going around.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.880
Huh?

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.850
Who the heck is this?

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.630

She tweeted that she was going to a cosplay event after that,

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.760
so I went because I wanted to see the outfit close up.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.810
And then... My chest is literally about to burst.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.010
Of course it is!

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.010
I made that to fit you perfectly...

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:25.520
And then I found out that you made it, Gojo Dolls

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.340
so I followed you home.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.520
I'm sorry.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.280
These girls and their tenacity!
Let's not do this!

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.660
Is there anything you'd like to eat tonight?
I'll eat whatever you make, Gojo-kun!
Koyomi's food is the best
I'll be right over after work ♥♥♥
Understood.
Done with work~!! Heading over to your place now ♥♥

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.860
For real?!

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.880
This is Sajuna Inui-san.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.660
Hey!

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.260
Don't go telling her my real name!

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.330
I use a cosplay name for a reason—

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.310
Wait, Juju-sama, your name is Sajuna?!

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:41.880
"Sama"?

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.370
Damn, that's so cute!

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.460
My name is Marin Kitagawa and I for real love you so much!

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.460
I'm your biggest fan!
Wait, too close—

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.320
Oh, my God!

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.140
You're really like, a pretty little girl in real life!

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.930
You're so cute!

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.290
Your skin's flawless!

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.340
Your hair's so fine!

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.300
Wait, did you pick Juju because your name is Sajuna?!

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.890
I-I didn't give myself that name...

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.480
Apparently, Inui-san saw your photos, Kitagawa-san.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.350
That's why she came here.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:12.340
This cosplay goddess... saw my photos?!

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.650
Juju-sama, you actually knew of my existence?!

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.240
Holy crap! That makes me so happy!

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.210
I-I just happened to see them... Also, you follow me—

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.660
I can't right now! I'm so embarrassed!

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.210
Seriously, you're way too close!

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.580
Don't get the wrong idea!

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.950
It's not you I'm interested in,

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.840
it's the costumes Wakana Gojo makes!

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.170
Your eyes are huge... You are so cute...

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.220
Would you listen?!

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.660
Wakana Gojo.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.230
I want you to make Shion Nikaido's Black Lily outfit for me.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.140
What?! Shion-tan?!

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.480
Shion-tan? Isn't that...

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.230
Yup! Shion-tan from Flower Princess Blaze!!

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.000
It's popular with little girls. You don't know it?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.280
I'm terribly sorry. I don't know much about anime...

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.970
Princess Lily!

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:04.050
Shion Nikaido is a character who appears in Flower Princess Blaze!!

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.800
She and the protagonist Mirai fight together

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.470
by becoming the Magical Girls Flower Princesses.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.090
I'll make sure you can never stand before the proud lily ever again!

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.670
Magical Girl...

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.380
Princess Lily!

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.680
But... Does that mean...

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.830
I've been fighting you this whole time, Sister?!

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:28.730
She finds out that her beloved older sister Neon is the enemy...

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.810
But Sister, why?!

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.490
She's totally open!

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.470
Shion... You know this yourself.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.740
Happiness never lasts forever.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.580
Our false family,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.310
and everyone looking down on us...

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.500
Is that truly what you wanted to protect?

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.260
No... Stop!

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.560
In reality, I wanted destruction...

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.400
To destroy everything.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:04.500
N-No!

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:09.850
I-I guess Black Lily's bursting onto the scene...

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.240
You wanted to taint everything, didn't you?

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.870
So they'd match the color of your heart...

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.160
An ebony as dark as the abyss.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:32.540
The popularity of the Nikaido Sisters exploded among grade school girls and adult males when it originally aired

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.920
Yeah, exactly!

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.470
Neon-oneetama originally became an enemy

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.090
after her flower jewel was tainted from the shock of a broken heart.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.410
It's super tragic.
I guess she knows her stuff.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.900
I see...

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.170
I figured she was the type that didn't know anything about the original work or characters
I love Neon-oneetama so much!

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.470
I mean, anyone would break after getting their heart broken like that.
and just wanted to cosplay the characters because their outfits were cute.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.550
Neon-oneetama must have gotten her heart broken really badly.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.600
She totally did!

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.370
Two of her childhood guy friends were totally dating!

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:51.730
Huh?!

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.880
I mean, it's not written anywhere officially,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.250
but you totally get it when you see it!

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.140
Yup.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.470
You sure do.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:09.370
Soma Princess Rose Sakuya Flower Pet
Shion (Princess Lily)
Protagonist Mirai (Princess Daisy)
Neon (Black Lobelia)
Princess Anemone Princess Azalea Teacher Sisters
Childhood Friends Siblings BFFs Rivals Brainwashed
Dating

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.740
The relationships in Blaze are pretty complicated.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.090
Mirai-taso and Shion-tan are super in love with Sakuya-kun.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.500
They hardcore fight over this boy!

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.360
But Sakuya-kun is totally with Soma-oniichan

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.370
so they're doomed from the start.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.610
And let's not forget that Onee-tama had a mad crush on Soma-oniichan.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.130
O-Oh, I see.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.000
This is for little girls?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.840
Shion is a genius,

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.220
but she always gets screwed because she had a rough life.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:25.340
But the fact that Shion can always smile like a little brat no matter what

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.100
made me love her more than any of the other magical girls.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.700
That's why I don't want to compromise.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.480
Even if you buy the official Black Lily's outfit, it's hard to alter.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.240
That's why I want you to make one that fits me perfectly.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.680
Juju-sama as Black Lily? I could just die!

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.540
I would kill to see that!

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.040
Well, you do love Shion-tan very much, Kitagawa-san.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.790
You even have her all over your bag.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.210
If you like her so much, why don't you cosplay her?

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.920
Yeah, I won't be doing that.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.590
Why?

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.420
I'm pretty tall, and not to mention,

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.340
don't I seem way off from Shion-tan's small and delicate demeanor?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.970
I do think ignoring that and cosplaying characters you love anyway is valid, too...

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.640
But in my case,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.850
I love her so much, I don't want to destroy her image.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.580
If I'm actually gonna cosplay someone,

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.690
I wanna get as close as possible to them.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.920
And if we're talking about Blaze, I totally wanna be Neon-oneetama!

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.590
What the hell?

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.570
Why are you stating the obvious?!

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.440
Oh, God!

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.740
She's the kind of cosplayer that I absolutely love!

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.820
I didn't know a thing about her

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.170
and just decided that she wasn't serious about cosplaying at all.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.170
She's not some annoying bitch at all!

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.230
I'm so sowwy! Pwease fowgive me!

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.750
For what, exactly?

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.770
Okay, I'm going home.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.430
Right.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.370
Your uniform should by dry by now, so I'll go and grab it.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:52.270
Wakana Gojo.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.500
Yes?

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.530
Give me your contact info.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.560
I'll send you more info on Black Lily and my sizes.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.110
Oh, sure.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.520
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.240
This is just so we can talk about the outfit.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:03.980
Huh?

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.620
The wrong idea about what?

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.040
About what?

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.130
Aren't you two dating?

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.680
N-N-No! We aren't!

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.960
A-Also, I-I've never actually gone steady with anyone before!

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.650
One steady... Two steadys...

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.300
I apparently had the super wrong idea.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.610
Three steadys... Sorry.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.050
It's fine... Four steadys...

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.080
What?

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:37.940
Teehee Teehee Teehee

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.880
You don't have a girlfriend right now, Gojo-kun? For real?

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.960
Was it that amusing?

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.940
Is she an annoying bitch after all?

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.150
Oh, hey. Juju-sama!

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.610
What?

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.070
Um...

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:51.260
You know how I said I'd like to cosplay Neon-oneetama from Blaze?

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.160
Yes?

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.410
I'll cosplay Neon-oneetama...

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.210
So, will you cosplay Blaze with me—

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:00.960
