Sewing Practice Room Say what now?

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.440
Oh, did you not get all that? The title is pretty long.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.530
From Saint♥Slippery's Academy for Girls—

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.700
The Young Ladies of the Humiliation Club: Debauched Miracle Life 2! The Kuroe Shizuku-tan!

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.160
Humiliation Club

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.670
I want to cosplay as Shizuku-tan from "Slippery Girls 2!"

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.050
Episode 2
Wanna Hurry Up, and Do It?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.930
What is it, Gojo-kun?

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.390
I'm sorry, I should probably know this,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.310
but I've never heard of this "Slippery Girls 2."

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.310
For real? Okay, I'll give you the basic rundown.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.130
"Slippery Girls 2" is a super popular eroge that came out last year and did crazy numbers.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.320
An eroge...

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.450
There's even an anime coming out for it. Crazy, am I right?

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.730
So, the protag is the grandson of the academy's principal

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.460
and ends up going to this all-girls school because reasons.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.960
It's basically one of those common harem plots.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.130
A guy enrolling at an all-girls school is common?!

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.480
There are a bunch of emotional in-game events, so it's super popular.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.310
Wait, Gojo-kun. Are you not into the humiliation stuff?

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.180
Like sex slaves.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.840
Sex slaves?!

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.960
But the sex slaves in "Slippery Girls 2" are doing it for love, so it's totally fine.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.430
Honestly, it's pretty safe.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.810
"Fine"... "Safe"?!

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.870
The protag is ordered to join the Humiliation Club by the principal

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.680
and then the girls in the club... Wh-What should I do?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.200
Maybe I'm just not familiar with games,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.450
but I have absolutely no idea what she's talking about.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.750
Humiliation Club? Sex slaves?

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.950
Do games like this really exist?

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.720
Wait. Is she just messing with me?

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.400
For real, how long are you going to let me go on? I'm obviously kidding.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.210
How trusting are you?

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.080
Of course. I'm usually alone, so I don't pick up on stuff like this and didn't notice—

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.690
And if you pick that last option, the protag ends up the club president's sex slave.
Sh-She's not joking.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.260
Kitagawa-san isn't joking in the least!
It's, like, totally unbelievable.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.310
But this was also an act of non-con out of love.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.140
Her eyes are completely serious!
The moment I figured it all out, I was like, "No way!" and...

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.640
So basically, I wanted to buy "Slippery Girls 2" since the first game was so epic.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.200
If anything, Shizuku-tan's super cute, so why not?

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.780
And in the beginning, Shizuku-tan doesn't smile at all and is this total ice queen.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.840
You think, "What's this girl's problem?"

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.710
And then, like... You get more events, like, "Wow, she can make faces like this, too."

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.630
Before I knew it, I was head-over-heels in love with Shizuku-tan.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.510
I was totally obsessed.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.430
And I genuinely thought...

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.510
that I want to become Shizuku-tan.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.480
You get me, Gojo-kun?

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.220
Not in the least.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.960
I love Shizuku-tan so much that I just can't and, like...

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.260
But when Kitagawa-san is talking about the things she loves,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.360
she looks like she's genuinely having fun,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.740
so I can tell how much she loves Shizuku-tan.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.350
And then, it's, like, a super happy ending.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.310
Get it now?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.930
Question.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.120
Oh? You still didn't get it?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.810
I think I got the general idea, but I was curious about something.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.520
Like what? Shizuku-tan's birthday?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.400
N-No!

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.800
Um... "Slippery Girls 2" is a pervy game, right?

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.860
Yeah, it's an eroge.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.140
But it's epic.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.100
A-Aren't those age-restricted?

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.730
Aren't those age-restricted?

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.750
Yup. No problems here.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.730
Huh?!

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.520
Also, I thought that girls didn't like games like that, so they don't play them.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.160
Seriously? Of course we do. Like, everyone does.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.160
* May not apply to everyone

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.710
Besides, like...

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.200
Does being a girl or a boy matter when you really like something?

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.070
Absolutely not!

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.590
Right?

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.460
Okay, let's get started.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.110
Yes! I'm looking forward to working with you!

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.050
Gojo-kun, why are you tearing up?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.800
Okay, I guess I should look up what we need to do first.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.310
Oh, one sec.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.210
Let's see... Oh, there it is.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.370
A Beginner's Guide to Making Cosplay Outfits Ta-da!

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.780
This totally exists.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.610
Even First-timers Can Rest Easy A Beginner's Guide to Making Cosplay Outfits

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.120
Wow... I didn't know books like this existed.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.990
The basics of constructing a cosplay

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.990
That guide rules, so definitely give it a read.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.960
Whoa, it even tells you how to pick fabrics and draft patterns!

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.330
Yup, yup, yup! Super handy, right?

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.000
They even tell you how to use sewing machines in detail.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.550
I know, right?!

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.010
Why couldn't she do it if she had a book that's this crystal clear?
"Why couldn't she do it if she had a book that's this crystal clear?"

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.430
is totally what he's thinking!

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.430
I see.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.320
We'll just have to buy the things we still need,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.850
and we can start with the measurements.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.380
Why don't we do that now?

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.480
Er, no.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.260
It's already pretty late today.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.550
I know the weekend's coming up, so let's do it on Monday.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.280
Right... okay.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.490
Gojo-kun.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.200
Yes?

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.830
Thanks.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.480
I'm looking forward to Monday.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.900
Right.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.140
Hey, I'm coming in.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.130
You're going to bed already? That's rare.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.520
Yeah...

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.480
I'm gonna go buy a sewing machine tomorrow, so you don't need to open up the shop.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.440
Got it.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.320
Make sure you take a bath before bed.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.160
So much happened today...

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.170
Even First-Timers Can Handle It A Beginner's Guide to Making Cosplay Outfits

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.670
I want to help her out somehow.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.760
Huh?!

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.950
H-Huh...?

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.730
Gojo Dolls

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.530
Yes! Coming! I'll be right there!

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.730
I'm terribly sorry! But we're closed today—

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.360
Heya! I'm here!

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.160
K-K-Kitagawa-san?!

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.660
Wh-Wh-Why are you here?!

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.010
How did you know where I lived?!

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.500
Do you really have to ask why?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.480
How the heck am I supposed to wait until Monday to become Shizuku-tan?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.760
So I searched for "Gojo" and "hina dolls" and just came over.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.760
Gojo Dolls She's so proactive!

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.820
So can I come in, or nah?

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.550
Huh? Like right now?

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.220
No?

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.660
U-Um... Here ya go.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.680
It's super yummy.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.520
Oh, you didn't have to.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.150
Thank you very much—

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.770
I'm coming in!

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.400
Uh, Kitagawa-san, wait!

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.190
Is your room upstairs, Gojo-kun?

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.460
Yes... Wait, no!

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.620
Hey, this is totally your room, isn't it?

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.450
K-Kitagawa-san!

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.080
Ooh!

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.120
This totally seems like your room.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.320
Haha, you didn't put your futon away.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.600
Do you use these for the dolls?

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.370
You paint with these super-skinny brushes?

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:02.140
Damn... Oh, don't worry. I won't touch them.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.350
But seriously, they're so—

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.360
Oh, no. My heart's being so loud that I can't hear a word she's saying.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:14.900
Badump Badump Badump Badump

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.900
Th-The only person that's e-e-ever been in my room is Gramps...

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.910
But now there's a girl... and it's Kitagawa-san!

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:25.850
Badump Badump Badump Badump Calm down!

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.000
I can't. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do!

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.180
Just chill out.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.320
I need to get a grip.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.760
Gojo-kun? Gojo-kun?
I need to make sure I'm not rude to Kitagawa-san...

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.340
Earth to Gojo-kun!

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.990
Uh, yes!

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.610
Wh-Wh-What is it?!

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.350
I said...

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.350
Wanna hurry up... and do it?

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.100
What... exactly?

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.920
Take my measurements, duh.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.250
You're the one who said we need to do that first.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.650
So c'mon, let's get to measuring.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.460
About that...

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.870
Could we have someone else do that part?

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.370
Huh? Why, though?

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.800
Do you not want to do this anymore?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.850
Er, no... It's not that. Um...

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.760
In the book I borrowed yesterday...

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:19.390
I-It said that for measurements... Um... You...

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.010
Y-You...

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.100
You have to be in your underwear...

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.100
Ah... So that's what you meant.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.040
Yeah, no probs.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.280
K-K-Kitagawa-san?!

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.510
Ta-da! I totally wore a bathing suit!

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.830
I figured you'd get all flustered about it.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.600
I totally thought, "Dude, I'm a genius," when I thought of this.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.310
Well? This solves that problem, right?

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.760
Uh, Gojo-kun?

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.720
Wait, hello? Are you okay?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.100
P-Please do not touch me right now!

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.040
W-Wait, what?! Sorry...

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.020
Okay. I'll start with your head measurements.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.170
Please be patient with me.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.320
Got it!

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.390
Would it be easier for you if I closed my eyes?

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.610
Calm down.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.290
Concentrate.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.220
I need to make sure... that I don't actually touch Kitagawa-san.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.100
Peek!

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.050
Wait, are you okay? That wasn't a good sound!

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.650
I'm sorry. I'm fine...

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:01.860
I'd like to measure the w-width of your shoulders... So could you turn around?

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.340
Sure...

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.260
I-It's no use. I can't keep my composure when I'm facing her.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.910
B-But I'm sure... I'm sure that from the back, it'll be—

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.420
Her back side isn't any better!

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.220
My hair's in the way, huh?

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:18.720
How's this?

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.100
Um... May I ask you a question?

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.970
Hm?

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:29.400
You're in your bathing suit right now, right?

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.710
Um...

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.520
A-Aren't you embarrassed at all?

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.890
Huh? Why would I be? Nope.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.150
I mean, I'm gonna become Shizuku-tan, so we need to follow that book exactly.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the heck was that sound?!

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.700
Huh?

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.750
What are you doing?

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.820
G-Gojo-kun?
That's right. It's...

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:57.160
This means so much to her. It's rude to have any indecent thoughts.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.570
It's nothing! There's nothing to worry about!

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.300
No way, there's clearly something to worry about!

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.550
She's actually relying on me.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.140
My heart and soul...

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.660
That's what I need to put into this.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.940
All of me!

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:27.450
I just need to... concentrate on making this.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.110
Horizontal circumference of head 53.8 cm Vertical circumference of head 57.7 cm Neck 27.3 cm Shoulder width 35cm Sleeve length 52.1 cm Upper arm 22.9 cm

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.350
Looks like things are going well.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.030
Yes.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.960
Oh, yeah. Gojo-kun, could you measure my feet, too?

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.780
Your feet?

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:46.680
I can't make shoes, so I was thinking about buying some to use.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.690
Yeah, but I totally don't get shoes because some can start hurting

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.010
even if they're the same size.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.310
Maybe the circumference isn't right.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.420
You mean here?

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.310
Yes. Let's get the width, too.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.720
I'll go grab a chair. One moment.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.780
Wait, this totally works.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.400
It's, like, the perfect height.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.380
No, it's not!

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.140
How is it not?

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.240
B-B-B-Because... I-It's dirty...

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.750
It's dirty!

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.380
It's all good. Yeah!

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.090
Wait!

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.510
Please don't...

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.080
Please get off that filthy thing immediately!

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.210
No, really. It's fine.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.010
Kitagawa-san, you'll get dirty! So, please!

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.280
Again, it's no problem, so let's get to measuring.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.850
I... I'll... I'll bring a chair immediately.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.860
I'm sorry. Please...

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.010
Gojo-kun.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:01.820
It's fine.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.550
Do it.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.760
Okay.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.270
I see.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.190
I'll keep this in mind the next time I buy shoes.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.970
Okay, let's keep things rolling!

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.050
Next up is... my bust!

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.580
I should probably tie my hair up for this, too.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.880
Hup. Here you go, Gojo-kun.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.450
U-Um, are you asking... m-m-me to measure them?

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.330
Of course I am. Who else is going to do it?

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.720
Can't you?

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.920
How, though?

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.780
When you measure them yourself, you have to bend over,

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.930
so I get a different result every time.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.510
It's way harder than you think.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.470
So... You've gotta do it, Gojo-kun.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.820
I can't...

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.390
Why can't you all of a sudden?

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.110
That makes no sense.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.490
But... I mean... I really shouldn't...

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.120
I don't get it, but just hurry. I mean...

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.680
My arms are killing me.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.230
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll m-measure them right...

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.340
away...

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.040
Sh-She's so close!

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.770
Wh-What's this distance?

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:34.140
Th-This is just... Kitagawa-san... No, no, no!

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.720
Don't think about anything else!

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.180
You're just getting her measurements. That's it!

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.480
Just concentrate on making her clothes!

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.510
P-Please lower your arms and stand up straight.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.670
Sure thing.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.530
Concentrate...

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.040
Concentrate...

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.580
Concentrate...

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.200
Concentrate!

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.470
I know, right? Crouching like that for too long is rough.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.740
Whatever position's the most comfy for you is totally fine, Gojo-kun.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.900
I wanna die.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.170
I-I'm done.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:23.310
Good job.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:28.020
Well, while we're at it, why don't we measure my inseam and bust point?

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.770
I can't.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.350
This again?

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.120
How the heck am I supposed to make the perfect boob bag if I don't have the right measurements?

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.400
B-Boob bag?

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.470
I want to give that part some extra love,

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.960
so I need you to psych yourself up.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.770
I'm sorry... But I can't.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.840
Aw, why not? Seriously, what's your deal?

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.800
I mean... I mean, how...

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.000
H-H-How am I supposed to...

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.590
How am I supposed to know where your nipples are—

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.500
H-How am I... Gojo-kun.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.650
Where can they be?

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.260
I'm kidding! Jeez, lighten up!

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.950
Don't freeze up like that.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:22.880
Yeah... I guess I can't exactly show you those.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.780
Sorry about that, Gojo-kun.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.460
I'll measure that myself, so pass me the measuring tape.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.670
S-Sorry. Thank you.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.170
Okay.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.590
Let's see...

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.010
So it's here to here...

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.220
No, wait. Is it from the outside? Or over here?

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.200
Let's go with 20 cm.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.550
Let's go with 20 centimeters... Let's go with 20 centimeters....

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.730
Let's go with 20 centimeters....

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.770
Let's go with 20 centimeters... Let's go with 20 centimeters...

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.070
Twenty centimeters...

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:57.280
It's only a number, but my mind just went blank.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.740
Foot length 23.2 cm Foot circumference 22.4 cm Foot width 9.5 cm Bust 86.8 cm Underbust 68.2cm Bust point 20 cm

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.430
I guess the last one we need is the inseam.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.870
Yes.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:10.000
At least with her inseam, I won't have to look at her face, so I won't be as nervous.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.250
I'm sorta done with myself.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.010
I keep getting flustered and panicky.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.680
Talk about lame.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:29.390
I want to be like Kitagawa-san, who never loses her head.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.180
Did you just say something?

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.070
I'm sorry. I was thinking about something, so I didn't quite hear you—

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.540
Kitagawa-san?

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.000
You're bright red.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.470
Huh?!

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.750
Um, huh? No way.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.870
What?!

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.610
N-No, you've got the wrong idea!

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.890
I'm just...

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.000
Is the room too hot?!

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.370
I'm sorry for not noticing!

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.940
I'll go turn on the AC.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.570
I wonder if it'll be hot again this year.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.560
Maybe.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.900

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.780
Good job.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.810
I'll go put my clothes on.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:27.740
Sure.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.700
Kitagawa-san.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.460
Do you have any references for "Slippery Girls"?

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.330
I'd like to know the details of the outfit, so I can draw up the patterns.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.700
Oh, yeah, right. One sec.

Saint♥Slippery's Academy for Girls— The Young Ladies of the Humiliation Club: Debauched Miracle Life

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.050
Ta-da!

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.800
Here's "Slippery Girls" 1 and 2!

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:44.990
Here you go.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:48.720
Thank you very much... T-Two of them?

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.660
I thought that maybe the second one would be enough,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.440
but it might be better if you knew how the first one went, too.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.200
Sure...

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.440
Tomorrow's Sunday, so try playing them.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.320
They're super cute.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.920
Gojo-kun?

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.290
I'm sorry for interrupting you while you were changing...

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.240
I don't mind at all, but... are you okay?

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.410
Do you have a stomachache?

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.990
I-I'm sorry, I'm fine.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.180
It's just her bathing suit... I'm so pathetic.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.360
I'm home, Wakana.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.660
I got the new sewing—

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.430
I'm bewing watched... You're watching me...

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:39.700
If... If I do thish... I'll never be nowmal again...

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.740
Hey, Gramps. Dinner's ready.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.340
R-Right... I bought the new sewing machine.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.940
You mushn't... You mushn't... Nice. Thanks.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.680
I mean... he is at that age...

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.320
That said... He looks so damn serious!

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.660
I see... That's how it looks from the back.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.710
And he's taking notes?!

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.090
Oh, no!

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.100
