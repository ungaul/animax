00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
The train will stop beyond this point

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.520
Oh, found it. There's one in exactly two weeks.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.610
Two weeks...

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.860
I have to somehow finish the whole thing in two weeks?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.990

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.900
It takes me a long time to make clothes for hina dolls.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.410
Meaning an outfit for a person would take twice—no, it'd take even longer!

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.630
Handmade Hobby Shop Yuzawaya

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.360
This is the first time I'm making one,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.120
so I don't even know if making it in two weeks is actually possible.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.760
If... If I don't make it in time...

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.990
I'll end up disappointing Kitagawa-san, when she's really looking forward to this.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.720
Anyway, as soon as I get home, I'll make the patterns, then start cutting...

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.730
How long does the cutting take?

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.460
I'm not dealing with parts that I can just cut in straight lines, like a kimono.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.520
Will I even be done in two or three days?

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.530
It's no use. There's not enough time.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.540
I feel like I'm losing my mind...

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.420
"Slippery Girls" had started to violate Wakana.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.010
Episode 4
Are These Your Girlfriend's?

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.840
I'm home.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.470
Hey, welcome back.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.600
You're home pretty late today.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.980
Oh, sorry. I forgot to call you.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.980
Handmade Hobby Shop Yuzawaya
I was out shopping with a friend.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.810
With a friend? I see, I see!

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.570
So, what did you buy?

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.570
A CD? Maybe some books?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.460
Huh?

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.660
Lovely Legs Stockings

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.100
Huh? Gramps?!

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.460
Wacchan!

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.030
Miori-neechan... Sorry to call you over here.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.090
It's fine. How's Grandpa?

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.060
They're putting a compress on him right now.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.620
I see.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.920
Thankfully, he didn't hit a really bad spot.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.070
We'll get you some painkillers.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.620
Please take care.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.400
Sorry for the trouble. Thanks for everything.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.060
Gramps!

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.020
Hey.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.350
For crying out loud, Grandpa!

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.910
Hey, Miori. What're you doing here?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.910
Take your time.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.580
Don't give me that!

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.920
I was really worried!

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.050
Nurses' Station

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.660
You need to stay in bed for two weeks, don't you?

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.190
Dad wanted you to stay at our place until you get better.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.460
That's why I came to get you.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.060
Why not take them up on that? Uncle's house is closer to the hospital, too.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.520
Plus, we have a car.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.100
I see. I hope I'm not gonna be a burden.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.990
Wacchan, you should spend the night at our place, too.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.700
We'll put out a futon for you.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.440
Okay.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.610
I'll bring by some spare clothes tomorrow.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.760
Thanks, and sorry about this. Also...

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.490
Bring me my brushes.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.220
Huh?

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.540
Okay.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.540
Maybe we should take you to an acupuncturist, too.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.550
Yeah... Ow... Are you okay?

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.070
All this shaking's got me shook up.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.430
Oh, come on.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.520
I see. So that's why you weren't at school yesterday.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.230
Yes.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.900
I'll be stopping by my cousin's place again today to see how he's doing.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.070
You must be really worried.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.280
I hope your grandpa feels better soon.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.490
Yes...

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.620
Gojo-kun, let me know if there's anything I can help you with.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.290
Believe it or not, I can cook and stuff.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.430
Kitagawa-san...

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.010
Thank you very much.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.940
I'll be fine, though.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.710
I-I see.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.880
Oh, hey. Let's exchange contact info.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.470
It'd be best if we can reach each other if something happens.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.840
Right?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.850
Sure.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.950
I wasn't able to work on the outfit yesterday or the day before.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.080
I need to today, even just a little.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.950
Oh, yeah! The wig's been cut, so I brought it to give to you.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.410
Gojo-kun?

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.210
Oh, sorry.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.790
Man, midterms are next week.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.880
Talk about exhausting.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.720
Not to mention, I'm the type that just crams the night before.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.880
I-I totally forgot... That's right... We have tests!

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.880
Are you the type that always studies, Gojo-kun?

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.530

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.470
Between visiting Gramps and studying for tests...

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.950
I have to find time for making her outfit.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.660
Gojo-kun?

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.740
You okay?

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.980
Er, yes!

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.490
Sorry.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.230
I think... I might be in trouble.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.830
Hello, you've reached Gojo Dolls.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.460
A tour of our workshop?

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.340
Yes, I heard you offer tours... Er, yes. We do.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.740
Oh, thank goodness!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.260
My friend is very interested in hina dolls and mentioned that he wanted to see them.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.470
When would you like to come by?

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.730
Um... Is there any way we could do it tomorrow?

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.480
Tomorrow?!

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.300
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. We're actually closed from tomorrow to Saturday.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.490
If it's any time after that... Oh, I see.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:15.700
My friend is actually visiting from France and is going home the day after tomorrow.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.500
So tomorrow was the only day.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.500
Sorry to bother you. Thank you for your time—

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.660
Um! Actually, tomorrow will be fine!

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.530
Huh?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.460
If you're all right with me doing it, I can give you a tour after 4:30 PM.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.540
Are you sure?! Thank you so much!

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.080
Yes. Okay.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.410
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.000
What should I do?

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.820
What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.160
What should I do?!

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:03.740
What should I do?

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:52.300
World History A English Communication Basic Home Economics

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.520
All right, pencils down.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.270
Hell, yeah!

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.130
We're done!

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.220
I'll go ahead and finish the apron and headdress first...

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.900
Marin! How'd it go?

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.560
Huh? Hm... Not bad?

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.400
What's up?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.740
Wakana Gojo Free from work
I'm thinking about heading to your place now All done
Did you have dinner yet??
Hm...

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.870
I thought he'd be at his place at night...

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.240
but it doesn't look like it.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.370
Maybe since our tests are over, he might be with his Gramps and finally relaxing.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.380
I wonder... if Gojo-kun is okay.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.380
Stamina Beef Bowl

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.020
I guess I'll eat this all by my lonesome.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.210
My head hurts.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.600
I feel sick, like I'm gonna throw up.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.140
I can't focus on anything.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.990
I haven't been able to sleep properly for a while now.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.560
The outfit... isn't done at all.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.080
Kitagawa-san was so excited for it, too...

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.700
She'll probably be really sad.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.480
Bring me my brushes.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.700
Why are you bringing brushes on your trip?

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.480
Hm?

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.010
If I don't keep these hands moving every day, I'm gonna get rusty.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.950
If I skip even a day, it takes another three days to get the hang of it again.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.240
I can't even use them properly yet...

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.060
How long has it been since I've touched them?

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.410
Maybe I'm just not cut out for it.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.480
Loving something doesn't mean you're any good at it.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.390
There's no guarantee that all your hard work will pay off.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.610
What am I going to do if I can't become a kashirashi?

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.850
And I'm not going to have the outfit done on time.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.730
Why can't I do this properly?

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.700
Why am I such a failure?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.540
I... I just... totally half-ass everything.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.550
Handmade Hobby Shop Yuzawaya

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.440
Gramps.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.770
Hm?

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.440
Isn't it really hard making hina dolls every day?

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.320
Don't you get sick of doing it?

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.740
Well, you're right, it's really hard.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.510
Loving something doesn't mean have a knack for it.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.330
Then again...

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.430
It's also because you love something that you can tough it out when things get rough.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.970
Whenever I see our customers smile, I'm always grateful that I decided to do this.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.270
Look.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:35.150
It's because you want to make someone happy that you can keep going, even when it's hard.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.360
Gojo-kun...

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.420
Thanks.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.340
I think that's fine.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.120
It's important to have things you refuse to compromise on.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.750
Hell, yeah! I wonder where I should wear the cosplay once it's done.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.700
I'm so glad you came with me, Gojo-kun.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:01.800
Thanks!

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.530
Scissors... My scissors... Where'd I put them again?

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:11.990
5/26 Saturday Wakana Gojo It's finished.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.990
Wakana Gojo I'm going to sleep.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.000
No way...

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.480
It was extremely close, but I made it in time.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.380
Now you can go to your event.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.130
Gojo-kun, wait...

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.170
You actually thought I was going to cosplay at today's event?

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.510
Huh?! Y-You're not?!

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.600
I...

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.480
had absolutely no idea how long it takes to make clothes...

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.790
And there are actually quite a few cosplay events if you search for them.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.880
I was gonna just wait until you were finished...

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.560
I'm so sorry!

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.620
You totally got the wrong idea because I wasn't clear...

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.670
Oh...

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.460
Thank goodness!

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.590
Huh?

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.410
I was so anxious about not finishing that I didn't know what to do.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.270
So there's still time.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.360
Thank goodness... Truly.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.820
K-K-Kitagawa-san?!

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.560
I...

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:34.120
Every time you went home right after school to study during our tests,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.380
I thought you were just visiting your grandpa...

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.380
You've been going through so much...

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.460
I had no idea you already finished...

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.830
I'm sorry... I just...

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.380
I had no idea...

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.380
Gojo-kun, I'm sorry...

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.670
I'm so sorry!

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:13.190
I-I'm also sorry for carrying on this project without telling you.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:18.130
We even exchanged numbers... I should've discussed this with you.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.770
No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Really!

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.420
Um... I... Er...

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.920
Why don't you try it on? Now's the perfect time.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.850
Huh?

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:40.960
I'll have you wear it so I can see if there are any parts that need taking in.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.420
I know! I'd love to see if everything looks together,

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.480
so let's have you put on your wig and do your makeup.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.880
But, Gojo-kun... You're exhausted.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.650
Kitagawa-san.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.860
You want to become Shizuku-tan, right?

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.580
Yeah, 'course I do... Then you should put it on.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.070
I'm happy that it's done,

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:09.480
so as long as you're happy with it, that's all I can really ask for.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.220
Er... Are you unhappy?

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.640
Of course I'm happy!

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.640
I'm so happy... Thank you. Thank you so much, Gojo-kun.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.730
Sure.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:31.020
Thank you... I'll wear the hell out of it.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.520
Really, thank you so much, Gojo-kun.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:35.990
Sure.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.040
Did it stop?

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.040
I think I'm okay now.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.660
It's finished.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.210
Were you able to get your makeup off?

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.880
Yup.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.390
In that case...

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.630
We'll draw your brows down for droopy eyes.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.440
The eyeshadow should be red.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.990
Your blush should be right underneath,

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:09.090
and to make your eyes stand out more, your lips should be a neutral color.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.080
That said, we're going to have to make everything pretty thick

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.480
so that it stands up to the outfit.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.680
So like sick girl makeup.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.530
Sick?

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.140
First, you stretch out the eye tape...

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.980
Then, place the tape where you want your double eyelid.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.820
I see.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.000
So you can even change the shape of your eyelids.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.220
I have some eye tape.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.560
Really?

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.750
I bought it because I really wanted double-eyelids, but ended up never using it.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.530
Oh, false lashes are a great idea, too!

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:39.970
Even with almond-shaped eyes

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.680
The winged ones that are longer on the outer corners

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.970
Eyelashes that are longer on the corner of your eye

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.530
can also make your eyes look a bit droopy.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.970
Put them on slightly droopy

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.970
Then you can really look like Shizuku-tan!

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.970
Droopy eyes!!

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.940
I don't have any false eyelashes, though.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.320
I tried using them once, and I just couldn't.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.380
Don't worry. I have some.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.140
Huh?

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.980
Gorgeous Winged Lashes Luxurious False Eyelashes
Elegant &amp; Beautiful Chic Eyelashes Girly Flair
Soft Winged Lashes (Chic)
There are a few styles here.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.280
Perfect. There are some winged ones, too.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.320
Kitagawa-san?

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.650
Are these your girlfriend's?

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:02.440
No! Some hina dolls have eyelashes nowadays,

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.660
so I bought these to try them out.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.540
Like her.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.160
Oh, whoa!

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.180
She's so cute! Hina dolls look like this now?

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.490
I would've been psyched if someone had bought me one like this.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.250
And her kimono's got roses on it.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.850
Some even have pink or orange lipstick nowadays.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.560
Some wear blush...

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.000
Some of them even have brown highlights in their black hair

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.880
and there are blonde ones, too.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.180
Wow, she's adorbs. And I bet she's a gyaru.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:31.050
I still can't tell myself, but apparently people like my grandpa

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.900
can tell who drew the faces just by looking at their eyebrows.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.980
Whoa!

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:41.240
But if you saw hina dolls like this, you can instantly tell who made them.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.120
I hope...

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.860
I hope that I'll be able to make hina dolls like this someday, too.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.000
I-I'm sorry! That's not important right now!

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.610
You will be.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.390
If anyone can do it, it's you, Gojo-kun.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.220
I just know it.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.970
Thank you very much.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.970
I guess that's how you look when you actually smile, huh?

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:22.770
Huh?!

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.110
I think that's the first time I've seen you smile like that.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.820
Wh-Wha... Huh?

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.470
R-R-Really?

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:31.490
Yup.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:36.360
Huh... Er, what do you want to do for your eyebrows?

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.510
Shizuku-tan's eyebrows aren't shaped like yours, so we'd have to get rid of them...

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.010
Hm...

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.300
Well, they'll grow back, so I'll just shave 'em off.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.580
No hesitation!

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.480
Um, Gojo-kun?

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.680
I put it on.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.270
Gojo-kun...

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.530
Do I... actually look like Shizuku-tan?

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.240
Yes! You're the perfect Shizuku-tan, Kitagawa-san!

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.190
Right? I know, right? Right?!

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.480
Gojo-kun, you're awesome! I'm totally Shizuku-tan right now!

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.250
Yes!

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.550
You're totally Shizuku-tan right now!

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.020
Episode 5

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.640
Probably Because It's the Best Boob Bag Here Next time!
