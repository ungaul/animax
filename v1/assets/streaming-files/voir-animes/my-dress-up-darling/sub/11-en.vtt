00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.250
Seriously, though...

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.570
It's so hot.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.400
Gojo-kun, don't you wanna cool off somewhere?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.280
Sure...

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.280
Manga Café Internet &amp; Comics Reception
First 30 minutes 190 yen Welcome.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.080
I've never been to a manga café before.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.260
Oh, really? I absolutely recommend them.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.710
They're nice and cool, you can read all the manga you want,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.210
you can eat, and they have drinks!

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.710
It's basically paradise.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.750
Right...

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.090
But...

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.970
We're so close.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.120
You can really stretch out your legs. It's the best!

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.990
Episode 11
I Am Currently at a Love Hotel

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.810
Man, these seats are so comfy.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.930
Ooh, a menu!

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.580
French fries, French fries!

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.850
We're really way too close...

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.960
Why is this room so small?

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.600
Um, is this normal for manga cafés?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.350
Yeah. Something wrong?

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.520
O-Oh, I see.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.300
Gojo-kun, wanna get something to eat?

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.180
Mega-Stacked Special Menu Recommended!
Fried Garlic Bulb 650 yen
Onion Rings &amp; Fries 680 yen The Classic Katsu Curry
Mega-Stacked

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.760
Oh, no! She's looking at a bonkers page!

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.540
I ended up bringing this with me,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.440
but I totally rec it! Give it a read!

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:00.530

I'm a Mega-Best-Selling High-School-Student Light Novel Author That Has a Succubus Thirsting for Me Every Night and I Don' t Know What to Do

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.450
"I'm a Mega-Best-Selling High-School-Student Light Novel Author

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.090
That Has a Succubus Thirsting for Me Every Night and I Don't Know What to Do."

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.060
Everything you just uttered was the title?

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.530
Yup! "SuccIDK" for short!

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.200
It's a slice-of-life, four-panel comic.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.420
"Slice of life"?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.910
Hmm... Like, nothing actually happens, but that's what's so great about it?

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.660
It's nice and peaceful, pretty much.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.410
So, the point is to enjoy the characters' tranquil, everyday lives?

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.160
Yeah, exactly! Tranquil!

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.170
Slice-of-life stuff makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.260
so I usually read it before going to bed.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:29.270
I'm a Mega-Best-Selling High-School-Student Light Novel Author That Has a Succubus Thirsting for Me Every Night and I Don' t Know What to Do by Kani Miso

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.630
In "SuccIDK," the protagonist Kaname-kun

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.530
stays up all night writing light novels, so he doesn't sleep,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.270
and the succubus Liz-kyun tries her best to get him to sleep.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.080
I've got a huge soft spot for half-pigtails,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.270
so I instantly fall for characters with them.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.770
Half-pigtails...?

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.400
Juju-sama was uber cute, too.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.200
I wanna cosplay Liz-kyun, too. I love her so much!

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.670
Liz-kyun!

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.360
...does show a lot of skin...

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.920
I'll put more thought into the next character I choose.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.040
Yes, compared to Veronica-tya...

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.460
Not like I'm gonna, but... Huh? But why?

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.660
Is it the amount of skin shown?

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.850
Skin? Oh, no. It's not that.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:05.890
It's not?

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.660
I mean, I love Liz-kyun, but her half-pigtails are too cute.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.270
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to pull them off.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.530
Only really cute girls rock that hairstyle,

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.070
so I don't think it'd suit me... y'know?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.140
Whoa, what's with the mega intense stare?

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.540
Is there something on my face?

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.920
Um...

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.620
I think they'd look really nice on you.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.070
You don't think they would?

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.410
Huh?

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.020
Unlike with Shion-tan, who was a small elementary schooler,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.740
you're saying it's the hairstyle this time?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.340
Yeah.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.650
Why don't you give it a try, then?

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.800
You like Liz-kyun, right?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.490
I think you'd look great.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.020
I-If you think so, G-Gojo-kun...

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.560
M-M-Maybe I'll do it... You should.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.290
She looked amazing as both Shizuku-tan and Black Lobelia,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.550
so I don't think she has anything to worry about.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.580
By the way, what exactly is a succubus?

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.090
I've never heard of them.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.880
Oh, basically, they're girl demons... I see.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.210
They make men have pervy dreams,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.760
and then they suck up all their semen and kill them!

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.390
What part of that is a tranquil, everyday life?

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.950
Yes, Gojo-kun?

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.250
Are you sure this isn't actually something rather disturbing?

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.850
Nope, not at all! It's super peaceful.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.390
You'll see when you read it.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.530
A demon that comes to kill you is peaceful?

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.860
I can't see how those two things connect.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.540
"Lullaby."

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.150
Ignore Hey! Go to sleep already! It's already 3 AM!

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.020
I know! I'll sing him a lullaby so he'll get sleepy!

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.190
Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree top... When the wind...

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.630
blows... the... clack clack clack clack Zzz....

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.980
"Chocolate."

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.850
Rawr!

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.670
Tch You may be getting enough sleep at school,

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.440
but a backwards sleep schedule is bad for you!

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.940
Your autonomic nerves go all outta wack!

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.210
Sure, you feel okay now, but if you keep it up...
How dare she say something sensible?

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.460
Slide Milk Chocolate Hey, Succubus.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.700
I'll give you my midnight snack, so shut up already.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.410
Om nom nom Wow, really? Thank you!

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.820
They have a milk filling and they're super yummy!

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.360
Flappity flap flap clack clack clack clack
I'm gonna go share these with the others!

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.160
It does make you warm and fuzzy inside.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.660
And she uses "boku" to refer to herself...

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.540
Boku girls are so cute! So effing cute!

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.560
I'm gonna go grab some other stuff.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.390
All right.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.200
I see... So this is slice-of-life.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:52.680
How nice.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.720
Wait...

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.600
Could it be that... Zzz....

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.310
clack clack clack clack Rawr!

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.310
You may be getting enough sleep at school, but a backwards sleep schedule is bad for you! Your autonomic nerves go all out of wack! Sure, you feel okay now, but if you keep it up...
Tch How dare she say something sensible?
These drawings have been simplified...

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.060
You're getting sleepy, Kaname-kun!
Hehe... Woooooo Hypnosis

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.930
so I have no idea how the outfit's supposed to look.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.810
Wow, really? Thank you!
Om nom nom
They have a milk filling and they're super yummy!

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.270
Ta-dah

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.980
There were parts I couldn't see in the other costumes,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.730
but this is on another level.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.990
How dare you keep writing light novels!!
You dumb light novel author!!
Her back is totally covered, so I have no idea how it looks at all!

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.210
I see...

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.500
Depending on the series, I may not be able to see all the details...

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.880
I'll have to think of them myself...

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.760
I'll have to...

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.730
Oh, man. It's already evening.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.990
We got to laze around so much.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.840
Yes. I had a lot of fun.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.020
I guess it's all good, then.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.760
Kitagawa-san, um...

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.020
Do you mind if we stop by a bookstore? I wanted to get "SuccIDK."

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.880
See? You're hooked! It's the best thing ever, am I right?

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.780
Manga Café Reception

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.940
I think there's a bookstore around here.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.000
Oh, there's a clothing store here, too.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.620
Oh, you got those?

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.790
They're always nice and cool, aren't they?

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.230
Those jinbei.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.180
Yup.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.620
I bought two of them.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.710
You look great.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.060
Gramps...

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720
I am...

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.010
...currently...

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.240
...at a love hotel.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.070
The Previous Day The previous day.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.820
I bought a swimsuit that looks like Liz-kyun's outfit and it's stupid cute.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.910
I've finished my work on this, as well.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:35.790
F'Real?!

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.330
So happy
Actually, how about we do Liz-kyun's photoshoot at a studio?

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.510
Your place is all Japanese-style, and the posters in my room are a bit yikes.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.080
Hold up.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.080
I found a studio that sorta looks like Kaname-kun's place!

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.990
And it's super close to your place, Gojo-kun!

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.630
Huh? Oh, damn! It's only 5,900 yen.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.680
That's insanely cheap!

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.380
I had no idea there was a photo studio near my house.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.450
I reserved it so fast.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.180
Can you meet me at the station tomorrow?

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.390
All right.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.720
There's a photography studio here?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.140
Um, yeah...

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.150
You gotta pay first, so I'll go ahead and take care of that.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.940
We're in room 303.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.280
Huh?

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.320
Room 303?

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.240
Here we are.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.420
Oh, damn!

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.590
This bed's huge! It's so awesome!

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.800
I think it's bigger than a double.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.460
If you're a mega-bestselling light novel author, your bed needs to be at least this huge!

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.880
It's so roomy, yet simple! It totally looks like Kaname-kun's room!

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.250
Ooh.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.680
An electric massager right by your pillow!

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.970
Yeah, there's no hiding that this place is a love hotel.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.790
Oh, well.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.640
What's the matter, Gojo-kun?

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.650
D-D-Did you just s-say a l-l-love... A love hotel?

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.320
Yup! This is a love hotel!

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.680
Y-Y-You didn't tell me that!

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.740
Wh-Wh-Wh-Why... Wh-Wh-Why are we at a love hotel?!

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.640
I thought this was a photo studio!

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.080
Oh, so yesterday...

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.830
Saint♥Slippery's Academy for Girls— The Young Ladies of the Humiliation Club: Debauched Miracle Life 2
I found a huge bed like the one Kaname-kun has.

Rental Space Reorder Cosplay Photos OK 3,900 yen

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.780
You can take photos here and it's super cheap.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.930
Why would I pick anywhere else?!

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.880
So I insta-pushed reserve...

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.730
And it was totally a love hotel!

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.450
I finally realized it when we saw the outside of the place!

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.680
I seriously had no idea! Sadface!

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.390
Guess I should've read the details more carefully.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.720
Kitagawa-san actually is like this!

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.710
But even considering the oopsie, this room's pretty sweet!

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.520
It's simple and totally seems like Kaname-kun's room.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.520
If I just... imagine it's only a studio...

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.240
How can I manage that?!

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.860
I'm not that imaginative!

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.180
I didn't feel this at the abandoned hospital...

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.210
But everything in this room feels so... mature...

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.920
I can't... I'm getting dizzy.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.070
Just thinking about being at a l-love hotel with Kitagawa-san...

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.390
But, y'know...

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.960
I've been sorta curious about love hotels.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.640
I've seen cosplayers have girls' nights at love hotels, and they look like a blast!

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.530
Girls' nights at a love hotel?

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.240
Yup.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.020
They go like this...

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.150
The #SevenBFs group cosplay girls' night out is way too fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And there's a bundle where you can spend the night as a group.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.840
You're right. They do look like they're having fun.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.910
I know, right?

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.730
Is that all bread underneath?

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.830
Yup. I think they have it here, too.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.360
Do you like sweet things, Gojo-kun?

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.680
I've been having a piece of candy sometimes while I've been working lately.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.340
Chocolate's better when you're gonna use your head a lot!

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.840
Kaname-kun eats them, too.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.240
Ah, so that's why he was eating them.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.580
Let's make an order.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.630
Oh, thank you very much—

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.290
Wait, hold on a second!

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.510
I give that fake-out 10 out of 10.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.160
I know this was an honest mistake, but minors like us aren't supposed to be here.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.160
Yeah, if you're normies.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.730
We are normies!

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.950
Okay, it was my bad. It really isn't a good idea.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.990
On that note...

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.340
I'm gonna get changed.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.610
Why, though?!

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:09.620
1000 Yen

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:08.160
I mean, I came here to cosplay! It'd be a total waste of money if we didn't do anything, right?

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.620
Well...

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.240
Wh-Whoa! This tub is bonkers! It's hella bougie!

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.650
It's a Jacuzzi, too!

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.630
Wanna get in with me?

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.970
JK! Totally kidding!

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.420
Just sit back and relax!

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.020
I can't...

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.750
relax in the least!

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.600
It's true that we shouldn't let 6,000 yen go to waste...

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.000
And yet...

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:37.770
Kitagawa-san!

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.440
Th-This place... This situation is just...

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.610
I'll just watch some TV.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.770
Maybe that'll distract me a bit.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.040
So this is what a love hotel is like...

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.630
But you can't... Do that...

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.270
I can't watch any more!

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.560
Gojo-kun!

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.110
Yes! I'm sorry!

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.800
I can't even! This is so cute, I'm super hyped!

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.490
I saw your sketches, but the real deal is crazy!

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.240
Really?

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.410
Yeah, it's super hot!

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.240
I'm being modest here, but you're a genius!

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.080
The fact that the buttons are pearls is uber cute.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:37.420
And the back of the collar being a heart is sweet!

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.710
The collar's good! It's all so good, I can't deal!

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.050
For the collar, I matched the shape of Liz-kyun's tail,

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.360
and used both chemical and cotton lace.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.840
Oh, so that's what that fabric's called!

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.640
And...

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.350
I did some research on succubi.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.210
Since I was going to make this, I figured I needed to face succubi head-on.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.350
You're so serious!

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.130
They are demons who seduce men, so there were a lot of characters in sexy outfits,

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.470
but "SuccIDK" doesn't concentrate on that factor,

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.650
so I made it cuter.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.870
There's no way that this comfy pillow made for you foolish humans would work on...

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.500
Zzzzz... You totally get it!

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.790
But her height changes a lot,

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.680
so I imagined that if Liz-kyun were real,

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.050
the simplified parts would look like this or that,

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.460
and I ended up adding on a lot of details.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.300
It's basically just my imagination.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.740
If we're going for accuracy of Kani Miso-sensei's designs...

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.470
I'd have to admit the cosplay is technically wrong.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.260
This totally works, though.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:32.890
Huh?!

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.820
Like, there are times where outfits in the manga and anime are different...

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.160
Really?!

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.440
Yup. But it's totally fine to cosplay the anime version, too.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.170
People making cosplays think hard about their costumes,

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.190
and go by their own interpretation, so everyone's is totally different.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.070
But that's what's awesome about it.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.260
It's that freedom that makes cosplay fun.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.620
So this costume is your interpretation, and that's totally fine, Gojo-kun.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.000
Not to mention, all your cosplays are so good, they can never be wrong.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.020
Your costumes are the best!

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.300
Th-Thank you very much—

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.270
Oh, but real quick...

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.440
Y'know that urban legend about how keeping a condom in your wallet makes you rich?!

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.810
Wanna try it?!

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.770
Wh-What kind of legend is that?

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.980
I saw it on TV a while ago. Cosplay costs a lot of money,

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.860
so I could use some financial luck!

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.830
Found some!

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.120
Here's yours, Gojo-kun!

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.800
I have to do it, too?!

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.580
Duh, of course!

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.370
Wh-What?

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.340
Are you sure I don't look weird with half-pigtails?

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.210
You don't look weird at all!

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.680
It looks like Liz-kyun hopped out of the manga!

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.980
Really?

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.360
I'm actually super embarrassed right now.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.460
Wow...

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.110
How beautiful!

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.230
Huh?!

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.950
The wig. It's such a gentle color, but so vibrant.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:21.290
The wig? I mean, yeah, but... Huh? Oh, I'm sorry...

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.500
But seriously...

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.090
Once I put on the wings, it's like I'm cosplaying a 2D character and it's so good.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.420
I'm hyped.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.250
Um... There're actually some scenes I wanted to recreate.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.590
F'real? Which ones?

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.500
I made sure to mark them.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.890

Did you, like, mark almost every page?

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:45.060
Beginner's Guide to Hypnosis

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.660
I even brought some props!

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.040
Oh, whoa!

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.130
We'll totally get some amazing pictures with these!

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.820
You are getting sleepy...

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.030
Oh, no! I wish I took a picture of that!

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:00.150
You're so frantic! I mean, I'll do it as many times as you want.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:25.230
LAPSE     SLO-MO     VIDEO     PHOTO   PORTRAIT       PANORAMA

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.350
Yes! That's perfect!

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.710
You're wearing an eye mask, but it's totally Liz-kyun!

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.380
Next, I'd like to get a shot of you eating chocolate.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.590
Okie-dokie!

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.470
Yum! Can I have another one?

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.310
Kitagawa-san... One more!

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.230
Um, Kitagawa-san! We got enough shots with the chocolate!

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.050
One more.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.230
One more.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.140
We took so many photos.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:31.980
Yes!

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.200
For the last one... Lullaby Chocolate

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.200
I wanted to get a shot of her singing the lullaby to Kaname-kun.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.950
Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree top...
There it is! That scene is a must.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.310
Let's take it right now!

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.050
Yes, thank you.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.120
Not what you were looking for?

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.840
I wouldn't say that, but something seems lacking.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.920
If possible, I think what's lacking is direct eye contact.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.760
You mean like, from Kaname-kun's point of view?

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.260
That's it!

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.300
Kitagawa-san, get on top of me!

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.650
Let's get the shot from Kaname-kun's point of view.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.640
On your tummy?! Wouldn't it be hard to breathe?

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.960
I'll be fine if we get the shot quickly.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.480
O-Okay...

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.900
If I'm too heavy, just tell me, okay?

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.280
All right.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.900
I'm going to lower my hips. Are you ready?

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.030
Sure.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.570
H-Here I go.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.700
You're totally fine. Okay, I'll take the picture.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.680
Thanks!

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:27.910
Click

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.250
Wha?!

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.630
OMG, it's so good!

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:34.420
Yes!

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.700
Per-fec-tion!

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.010
It's amazing how different it turns out just by changing angles.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.330
I'm...

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.600
I'm having so much fun!

Getting ready, putting on the cosplay, taking photos and admiring them together...

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.490
Every last thing... is so much fun!

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.260
Seriously, everything about cosplay is so much fun!

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.570
I'm having so much fun right now!

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.730
Yes, I'm having a lot of fun, too!

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.250
I think I hear a voice from the room next door...

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:17.650
That's right! We're in a love hotel right now!

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.180
I... I was so caught up in the photoshoot...

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.800
and I told her to get on top of me!

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.900
Kitagawa-san! I need you to get off of me right now!

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.400
Hello! This is Gojo Dolls—No, wait!

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.610
Yes... I'm sorry, what do you mean by extension?

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.240
Oh, no. That's all right.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.280
Yes. Thank you.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.220
A-Apparently it's time to leave the room!

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.760
Oh... right.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.030
Um... I-I see...
