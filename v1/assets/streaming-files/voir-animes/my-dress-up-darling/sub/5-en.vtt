00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.780
Gojo-kun...

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.040
Do I... actually look like Shizuku-tan?

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.790
Yes! You're the perfect Shizuku-tan, Kitagawa-san!

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.760
Right? I know, right? Right?!

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.000
Gojo-kun, you're awesome! I'm totally Shizuku-tan right now!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.840
Yes!

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.630
You're totally Shizuku-tan right now!

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.850
Oh, but how's it fit?

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.980
Is it too tight anywhere?

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.780
It fits perfectly! But it might be a little hard to move around.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.350
I can't raise my arm much, but that's totally fine!

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.580
Oh, right... When I'm making clothes for people,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.050
I have to consider both comfort and mobility.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.580
But, more importantly!

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.740
I still can't believe you got this boob bag down perfectly!

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.380
I had no idea it could be made this perfect!

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.040
I can't believe it! It's perfect!

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.920
The skirt is, like, the perfect length. You totally get it.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.570
The little peek at Shizuku-tan's garters from underneath her tulle is adorable,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.840
and you even got that down!

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.440
Gojo-kun, you're a god!

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.300
Th-Thank you very much.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.590
I'm flattered, but I still have a long ways to go.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.920
I'm actually Shizuku-tan right now. I seriously couldn't be happier.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.770
I can't right now. Like, seriously.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.200
Wait, what?! I can't! This is so perfect that I seriously can't right now!

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.490
I just?! What?! For real?!

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.780
I'm getting so excited! I'm going to lose it!

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.800
K-Kitagawa-san, calm down.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.180
Oh, yeah! Photos!

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.310
I want to take some pics! Take them for me!

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.630
Um, let's see...

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.370
Okay, here we go.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.740
Did you get it?

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.930
Let me see! How fierce do I look?

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.090
Oh, excellent.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.510
But, you know...

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.890
This just looks like you, Kitagawa-san.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.680
What's wrong with that? It's sorta hilarious.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.020
Saint♥Slippery's Academy for Girls— The Young Ladies of the Humiliation Club: Debauched Miracle Life 2
Well, since you're cosplaying, maybe you should pose more like Shizuku-tan would.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.000
And this room isn't a great backdrop for making it seem like you're from that world.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.530
Gojo-kun, how about over here?

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.050
The background will look white over here.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.660
Okay, make sure you act like Shizuku-tan this time.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.040
Gotcha!

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.550
Wait, my bad!

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.050
God, I'm ugly!

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.880
Nope, I can't! How could I not smile right now?!

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.060
This smile's not going anywhere. I'm so happy right now I could die!

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.100
Wait, no. I promise I'll be mega serious.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.360
I'll do it right, so take it one more time.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.690
O-Okay.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.950
Okay.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.530
Ready, and...

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.410
How was that one? Did we get it?

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.830
Yes! You're Shizuku-tan in this one.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.720
For real?

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.220
Yes! Let's keep going like this.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.500
Okay!

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.410
Looking good! You've got her pose down completely!

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.020
Yes! Just like that!

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.860
You are Shizuku-tan!

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.480
Now, look right at the camera.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.020
That expression... is when Shizuku-tan and the protagonist first... Magnificent!

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.210
Do you think that's enough?

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.190
Thanks! Let me see!

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.250
They look great! I'm psyched!

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.970
I'm gonna create an account and upload these, like, right now.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.360
You're uploading them already?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.290
Yup. Actually, I hadn't thought of a cosplay name yet.

Holy crap, these are too cute!

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.540
I can't even right now.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.080
Hey, Gojo-kun.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.510
Yes?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.270
Why don't we just go to tomorrow's cosplay event?

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.380
Huh?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.770
I suddenly wanna go.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.680
Let's go, Gojo-kun!

It's Probably Because This Is the Best Boob Bag Here

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.890
Oh... Oh, my God...

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.940
Cosplay events are amazing!

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.540
There are cosplayers everywhere!

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.980
Hey, that's Mami-tan! She's totally adorbs!

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.820
Wait, is that Soji and Ryoma-kun?!

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.820
Lancelot and Kenshin! Even Leo-sama!

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.760
And over there, I see Cirque and Soleil! Squee! I'm so hype!

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.830
R-Right...

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.140
And right now... I'm finally making my cosplay debut!

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.290
I'm so happy right now. This is the best.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.480
Thank you so much, Gojo-kun!

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.370
Gojo-kun?

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.460
What's wrong?

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.640
Oh, it's just, um... Th-There are just so many ladies around, I just...

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.550
don't feel like I should be here.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.640
I can't calm down.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.470
Seriously?

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.600
A-Also, I feel like everyone's looking at us.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.030
You're right...

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.980
Oh, I know!

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.230
I think everyone's just in awe of this outfit!

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.690
It's super adorbs!

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.460
No, I think it's because I don't belong here.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.950
I mean, these are my casual clothes...

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.200
What? And what's wrong with that?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.520
That's like totally your style. It's fine.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.410
Right... And let's not forget...

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.920
It's probably because this is the best boob bag here!

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.880
We've got everyone beat!

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.650
Kitagawa-san! Please stop lifting them up like that!

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.340
But if you're feeling anxious down here, let's go up to the plaza.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.140
I think there were some photographers and guys up there.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.560
Sorry about this...

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.140
Everything's super chill up here. Nice.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.560
I feel a little calmer up here.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.590
Ooh, Vanessa-sama!

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.660
She's so cute! And check out her huge rack!

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.020
I'm gonna get in line to get her pic, too!

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.370
Excuse me.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.130
Do you mind if I get some pictures?

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.610
Huh?

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.530
Wait, are you talking to me?!

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.180
Yes. You're cosplaying as Kuroe Shizuku from "Slippery Girls 2," right?

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.700
Yes! I'm Shizuku-tan!

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.480
Oh... do you not do photoshoots?

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.730
No, it's totally fine!

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.750
Actually, I'd love for you to take some!

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.730
I'd be happy to.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.260
Could I get a pose, please?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.100
Sure.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.420
Oh, whoa.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.920
That's super cute.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.460
Thank you so much.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.450
Oh, no. Thank you!

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.970
Oh, hey. Could I get a picture with you, too?

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:56.770
Huh?!
It's a special occasion!

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.270
Okay, I'm gonna take the picture.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.200
Hey, you can come closer.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.620
O-Okay...

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.700
Thank you so much! You made my day!

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.530
Excuse me, could I get some photos, too?

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.950
Sure, of course.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.990
When did she end up with a line?

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.160
Could I get a pose?

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.410
Good. She's looking like Shizuku-tan.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.640
That person's in drag.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.260
I guess there were a lot of girls-as-guys and vice versa down below.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.940
I see... They're cosplaying their favorite characters.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.580
That's why they can have so much fun so freely.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.460
This is... nice.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.280
I'm so happy that Kitagawa-san seems like she's having fun, too.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.510
And that I was able to keep my promise.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.500
Will you make me a cosplay outfit?

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.330
Oh, right. I fulfilled my promise.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.310
So I guess hanging out with Kitagawa-san like this...

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.000
ends today.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.840
Kitagawa-san...

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.530
I don't have any friends and was always alone,

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.940
so she was someone I'd never gotten to talk to before.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.170
Going somewhere after school with a friend,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.570
meeting up on our days off...

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.940
Spending time like that with someone was...

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.660
These were all firsts for me.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.510
This almost doesn't seem real.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.250
It was so much fun.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.230
Huh?

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.270
Huh?

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.930
Huh?!

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.640
K-Kitagawa-san...

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.360
Gojo-kun!

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.720
Y-Yes?!

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.150
Thank goodness.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.520
I thought you disappeared on me and I panicked.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.990
So... So, hey...

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.670
My...

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.230
clothes are about to come off!

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.200
Say what, now?

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.010
They're about to come off?

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.480
What part's not working for you?

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.270
Last night, I was looking at the photos you took of me.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.220
Wait...

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.820
Aren't Shizuku-tan's boobs bigger?

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.890
So, today...

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.400
I wore two NuBras and...

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.980
My chest is literally about to burst.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.280
Of course it is!

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:47.410
I made that to fit you perfectly, so there wasn't room for a NuBra,

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.830
and I mean, you're talking about the chest size of a game character.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.150
Also, it's really stuffy under this wig...

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.500
The outfit itself is just... so hot...

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.420
Holy crap... I'm gonna die.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.000
Of course. Because I picked the thicker fabric...

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.970
I'm so sorry! This is all my fault!

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.140
Let's go somewhere you can cool off!

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.200
That's so good. Thanks, Gojo-kun.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.420
It's fine. Do you think you can make it to the changing room?

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.030
Sorry, nope.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.770
I can't move.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.410
We should've been prepare to deal with the heat.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.040
I'm so sorry.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.920
That feels so good!

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.840
You should also cool off your neck, underarms and any place with a major artery.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.410
'Kay.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.950
Here's a towel. Go ahead and wipe off any sweat.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.560
Thanks.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.730
Yikes, look at all this sweat.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.430
I don't think I even sweat this much in PE.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.990
Wearing black fabric makes it worse.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.490
Double NuBras are too powerful.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.370
I'll see what else we can do to help!

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.720
Thanks.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.400
Heatstroke is no joke, so we'd better be careful.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.510
Oh, I found... something...
Remove clothing, or loosen belts, neckties, bras, or underwear to help let the heat escape from your body.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.790
For real?

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.970
Could you unzip me, then?

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.620
Huh?!

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.770
It doesn't have to be all the way, my dude. I can't be too revealing, anyway.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.230
Just unzip it a little.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.710
L-Let's at least get you to the dressing room!

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.960
Right. Kitagawa-san can't move right now.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.310
She seems to be having a really rough time.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.480
This is...

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.920
no time for me to be panicking.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.460
Please excuse me.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:10.050
Holy crap! It's so much cooler now that my back's unzipped.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.630
Ugh, but seriously, my panties are drenched with sweat.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.060
I should've brought another pair.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.920
Gojo-kun, could you wipe down my back?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.980
S-Sure...

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.380
Don't panic.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.440
Please excuse me.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.320
I-I'm going to wipe.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.070
Oh, crap...

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.910
Gojo-kun, could you go a little lower, too?

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.750
L-Lower? L-Like here?

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:48.170
Yeah, there. Ooh, right there... That feels so good.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.150
Oh, wow. Ah... There, more.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.560
K-Kitagawa-san, please keep your voice down.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.780
What if someone sees us?

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:08.210
Yeah, that's not happening. Not to mention, it's not like I'm trying to be heard.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:09.800
Oh, yeah.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.370
It's all stuffy inside my skirt.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.300
Gojo-kun, could you hand me the towel?

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.910
S-Someone might see down there!

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.200
You don't need to worry about that.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.370
Cosplayers! Please try to avoid any accidental exposure!
U-Underwear?!
Showing too much skin or wearing what may be mistaken as underwear is prohibited. Please make sure to wear some kind of covering like a bodysuit to prevent exposure.
Please ask before taking photos
Taking photos without permission is prohibited

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.010
I'm wearing shorts.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.370
I-I see.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.090
Kitagawa-san, did you write those yourself?

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.130
This?

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.650
Well, if I'm gonna be Shizuku-tan, I figured I should go all out.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.560
I-I see...

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.220
This should help reinforce it.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.470
Thanks.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.710
A sewing machine would be able to make a stronger stitch, but...

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.670
Yeah. We should probably head home for today.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.920
Yes. I'm worried about how you're feeling.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.330
Sorry, Gojo-kun. Could we go back to the plaza again?

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.820
It'll only take a second.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.830
Hey, Miss!

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.250
Oh, you're the Shizuku cosplayer.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.700
Sorry for running off like that earlier.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.660
I got dizzy from being too hot.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:13.970
Are you okay?!

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:19.090
I'm actually heading home now, but I felt bad for bailing on you earlier,

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:20.700
so I wanted to meet with you before I left.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.890
Oh, you didn't have to...

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.740
Then could I just get one shot in the shade?

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.670
Sure!

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.860
This will be the last one.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.690
Could I get you to look at the camera?

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.290
IIII IIII IIII II

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.800
Oh, crap!

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.100
Don't worry! I'll delete those immediately!

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.850
I don't blame you.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.470
I wasn't looking at the camera at all.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:05.660
What?!

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.140
Could we possibly try that again?

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.100
That's what she's worried about...

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.200
I'm glad there's room to sit.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.700
Thankfully, the train isn't crowded.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.530
Great job today, Gojo-kun.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.680
I guess it's summer already.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.510
Yes.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.380
I'm jumping into the shower as soon as I get home.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.480
Kitagawa-san.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.840
Thank you so much.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.560
Things got a bit rough at times, but this was a great experience.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.590
I really had a lot of fun!

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.940
Me, too.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.220
I had so much fun.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.320
Thanks, Gojo-kun.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.800
What should we do for my next cosplay?

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.840
Huh?

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.130
My next cosplay.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.960
Huh? Wait, what?!

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.950
Y-You mean it's not just Shizuku-tan?

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:22.280
Of course not! I have at least fifty number one favorite characters!

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.800
What does the "one" even mean, then?

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:28.570
What should I do? I still wanna cosplay Shizuku-tan more, too.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:33.400
There are so many cosplays I wanna do, but I only have one body.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.400
What's this?

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.030
Gojo-kun, you seem super happy right now.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.570
Or am I imagining it?

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.930
Huh?! No, I, uh, I-I wasn't...

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.540
What is it, then? Tell me.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.140
So, um...

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.130
I still lack the proper experience, but I look forward to working with you again!

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.220
Yeah, for sure.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.910
Um, I'm going to buy a dress mannequin. It was a bit hard to work without one.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.140
Nice! Sounds like a plan! Actually, I'll buy it for you.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.230
Can you buy those online?

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.940
Oh, I found one. How about this?

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.120
You can take a nap if you're tired, Gojo-kun.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.910
Uh, sure. Sorry...

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.610
I had so much fun thanks to you, Gojo-kun.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.130
Actually, everyone seemed like they were having so much fun that it was insane.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.010
It's way too amazing that everyone there was just doing what they loved.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.640
I was so hyped just being there.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.130
It can be a hobby, or really, anything else,

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.900
but I absolutely love when people have fun doing what they love.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.500
It's like they're sparkling.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.150
Man, I wanna go to more events.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.890
I didn't even get to take any pictures with the other cosplayers.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.780
I'm gonna take a ton next time!

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.970
Oh, yeah!

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.120
The person who was cosplaying as Leo-sama from "Seven BFs"

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.010
in the lower plaza was super gorgeous.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.010
How can they be so beautiful without a filter? Like, how's that fair?

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.790
Right...

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.260
Kitagawa-san, you were very beautiful.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.100
Ever since then, the word "beautiful"

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.560
became associated with very special things to me.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.520
So I just can't say "pretty" or "beautiful" unless I absolutely feel it from the heart.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.300
Huh?

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.000
Huh?

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.270
Huh?

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.730
Huh...?

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.980
Episode 6
For Real?!

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.360
Next time.
