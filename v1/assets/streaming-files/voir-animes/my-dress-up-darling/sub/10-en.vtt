WEBVTT

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.880
You look so cute! You're so cute!

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.130
You're so cute, Onee-chan!

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.380
I know, right? Totes cute!

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.990
So this is what Shinju's like when she's taking photos.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.100
You should get in the shot next!

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.200
Okay!

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.500
Refreshing Sweat

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.500
I want to get the shot where Shion-chan first becomes Black Lily

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.460
and Black Lobelia tries to find out if she's really on her side or not.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.400
Hell yeah!

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.190
Is that okay, Onee-chan?

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.200
Sure.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.060
Everything's going okay. Even though we're at an abandoned hospital,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.720
there are a lot of us here, so I'm managing.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.650
Let's just keep things going.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.580
Kitagawa-san, no!

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.090
Black Lobelia always... has a sad face!

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.220
You're smiling too much!

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.200
Juju-sama, you are the epitome of cuteness! I can't deal!

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.530
I'm super sorry for touching your face.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.810
It's fine.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.640
But seriously, I'm having so much fun right now!

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.750
I can't get rid of this stupid grin! Holy crap!

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.860
I totally understand! You just can't help but smile!

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.140
Well, we have plenty of time.
What are you talking about?

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.610
You're goofing off, totally out-of-character and smiling, and it's affecting our photoshoot.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.640
I can't stand this.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.880
You're the type of cosplayer I dislike the most.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.910
What am I even going to do with you?

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.380
Episode 10
We've All Got Struggles

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.610
Next, let's get some solo shots with you, Marin-san.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.940
Okie dokie!

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.310
Wakana Gojo.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.710
Yes?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.540
Thank you very much... for everything you did for Shinju.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.980
Oh, no! It was nothing.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.960
That aside, you probably only had her pay for the raw materials for her outfit, didn't you?

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.150
I knew it.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.420
There are other costs involved, like transportation,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.950
but she probably has no idea.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.800
I'm sorry, I'll pay you back myself.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.910
She mentioned she only gets an allowance, so it's all right...

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.830
No, it's not. You need to be serious when it comes to money.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.840
But really, thank you so much for looking after Shinju.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.130
I had no idea that she loved Soma-kun so much that she wanted to cosplay him.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.880
There must've been some reason why she couldn't tell me.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.140
I've failed as her older sister.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.570
It wasn't anything you did, Inui-san.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.580
It's just...

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.400
It can be really hard to tell others what you love or what you want to do.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.320
It takes a lot of courage.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.580
I can totally relate.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.580
You took something that's so precious to me...

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.040
And handled it with so much care and consideration.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.730
You truly are...

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.670
Wonderful.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.630
Did you say something?

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.340
Nope. Not a thing.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.070
You don't need to hear me say that.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.650
Next, could you slowly look this way?

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.420
I got a really great shot of you just now!

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.240
F'real?!
Yes!

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.290
What's that sound?

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.380
Uh, Shinju-chan... Y-Your chest's getting bigger...

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.320
Fukudaya My B holder broke!

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.480
I just used the lighting from the studio, but that worked out perfectly.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.960
I really love this shot.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.610
You're right. It's a great photo.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.610
She's got the character down and looks great in that outfit.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.830
Yeah. There's a lot more depth, and it's nice.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.210
I thought I felt love at first sight with the outfit Wakana Gojo made...

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.210
But I guess that wasn't the only thing.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.870
Was my cosplay too weird after all?

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.640
What? No! That's not—

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.620
It's just a cosplay that I'd never be able to pull off...

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.520
So I got jealous, and couldn't help but stare.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.150
What?!

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.430
What's gotten into you? Why did you scream like that?

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.970
B-Because you said you were jealous, and that there's a cosplay you couldn't pull off...

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.810
What are you talking about? Of course I can't.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.620
But you always look amazing in everything...

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.430
That's just because I specifically pick characters

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.360
from my favorites that I think I'd be able to cosplay well.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.630
I'd love to cosplay as Black Lobelia or Soma-kun, too...

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.980
But with my height, I wouldn't fit the characters.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.010
That's the one thing I never want to do.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.380
It's not like I hate myself,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.750
but I often think, "I wish I were more like this," or "I could've done it if I were..."

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.560
If I had a nicer figure like you do, I could do so many other cosplays.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.780
I really am jealous of you, Shinju.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.740
We can't see what they're feeling inside,

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.110
but we've all got struggles.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.500
When I...

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.620
get into high school, I'm gonna get a part-time job,

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.900
save up money... and cosplay.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.990
Really?! That's great! I can't wait!

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.840
Yeah!

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.190
I spent way too much money this time, so I'll have to save up again.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.750
But, you know... Today was more exhausting than usual.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.560
I definitely prefer doing photoshoots with just you.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.530
Today was enough group cosplay for me.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.470
I... actually had fun.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.800
I'm so glad we did this group cosplay.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.230
W-Well, I guess it wasn't too bad.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.640
I guess I wouldn't mind doing it again sometime, when I feel like it.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.010
Marin Kitagawa Audio

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.700
Hello?

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.440
Gojo-kun! Did Shinju-chan send you the files?

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.770
Didja see 'em?!

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.290
I'm looking at them right now. They're all very nice.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.620
I know, right?!

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.150
I'm so hyped that I'm actually watching "Blaze!!" right now!
Neon's Past Revealed! The Meaning Behind Lobelia

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.610
She's watching it again...

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.870
More importantly, Gojo-kun, this was your first time doing a guy's makeup, right?

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.030
How'd you even do that? You're like a god!

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.380
Oh, no. I just read a magazine on how to do cosplay makeup.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.040
Uh, I've read 'em, too, but I can't do it like that.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.830
Juju-sama was uber cute and Shinju-chan was insanely hot. I had the best time!

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.660
I was like, "I guess Shinju-chan wanted to cosplay after all."

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.590
Don't cry, Neon!

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.510
Everyone's better off if I'm not around.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.510
It seemed like she had tons of fun.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.980
Yes, it really did.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.080
That's your uniform, right, Gojo-kun?

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.180
Yes.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.270
When she told me how she felt, it was totally relatable,

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.290
so I wanted to help her out any way I could.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.640
Gojo-kun, you wanted to cosplay, too?!

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.330
Huh?!

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.850
You should've just told me! Was it hard to bring up?

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.400
Whatever you wanted to cosplay wouldn't have weirded me out!

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.620
U-Um, that's not what I meant...

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.620
By the way, I had no idea you were preparing that Soma-kun cosplay!

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.210
When did you even plan that?

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.960
Oh, actually... After we looked around the studio that one day,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.310
I had her come over, and we started getting ready.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.300
That's not true, Neon! You three have been best friends forever!

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.980
I thought so, too...

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.930
But after seeing how those two look at each other...

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.270
Just the two of you?

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.390
Yes.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.440
She was embarrassed, so she asked me to keep it a secret.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:32.680
Oh, I see... Right. Of course. Yup. Right.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.440
I'm such an idiot...

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.880
Neon, no! Your jewel will become tainted,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.200
and you won't be able to become a magical girl anym—

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.870
Hello? Kitagawa-san? Is something wrong?

Power Recordings Blue Program Guide Nope. Not a thing.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.460
Summer vacation's the best!

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:28.430
I have plenty of time to practice painting the dolls' faces and making Kitagawa-san's cosplay.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.880
There she is!

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.810
She's so awesome! I can't!

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.920
How can you not fall for her when you see this?

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.620
Veronica-tya!

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.300
"Tya"?

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.850
She's tan, has shark teeth, her disgusted stare,

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.310
her face is genius!

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.850
And that underboob! Nothing beats her underboob!

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.250
Seeing such plump, healthy underboob makes you healthier, too.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.290
It's awesome.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.730
What does that even mean?

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.470
I can make this outfit pretty quickly.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.150
For real?! Let's do it!

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.720
But what should we do about her skin tone?

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.310
Should we try retouching it digitally?

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.410
Great idea!

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.970
I finished pretty quickly this time.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.150
Maybe it's because the design's so simple.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.870
Shizuku-tan, Black Lily, and Black Lobelia...

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.040
To think that there are so many different designs in the world...

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.070
I never would've known if I hadn't tried to make cosplays...

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.660
Gojo-kun!

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.890
Coming.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.350
It must be pretty hot out there.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.730
Did you want something cold to drink—

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.290
Thanks! Yeah, I'll totally take a drink!

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.110
It's blazing hot out here. I'm sweatin' like a pig!

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.900
Uh... You're so tan!

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.950
How'd you get so tan?!

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:05.910
Oh, this?

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.830
I totally got tanned for Veronica-tya!

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.950
You just go for it!

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.440
JK! I'm totally kidding.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.670
This is actually foundation that you can apply to your whole body.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.790
I didn't know they had one like that.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.590
Oh, yeah. Sorry for asking, but could I use your shower?

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.700
I'm way too sweaty. Like, yikes.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.550
Sure.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.350
Thanks! You're the best.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.240
It's so hot!

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.480
Yikes! This sweat's disgusting.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.190
I need to be careful or I'm seriously gonna get heatstroke.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.450
I heard you can even get it at home.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.010
Crazy.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.100
Kitagawa-san.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.800
You don't have a change of clothes, do you?

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.180
I'll leave some right in front of the door, if you don't mind wearing my clothes.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.710
For real? You sure?

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.820
More importantly, you're not gonna sneak a peek, Gojo-kun?

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.820
I absolutely will not!

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.960
My bad. But if we were in a manga right now, you'd totally sneak a look!

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.240
And I'd be, like, "Eek! Gojo-kun, you perv!"

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.690
Please don't joke like that!

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.670
Jeez, I'm totally giving you crap!

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.850
So good!

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.030
Thanks for letting me take a shower. I feel so much better.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:21.530
It's fine...

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.040
Gojo I know that I'm the one who let her borrow it...

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:31.990
But Kitagawa-san's in my PE uniform... Gojo

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.960
My clothing...

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:37.000
And she's using our body soap, so she even smells like me.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.070
What... What is this feeling inside me?

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.980
Gojo-kun, are you turning red?

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.880
I-I think you're just imagining it...

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.300
Okay, then. But look at these.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.700
This is the foundation I used earlier and some white mascara!

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.060
Now I'll be able to have Veronica-tya's eyelashes, too!

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:01.180
Oh, so this is it. Sorry to have you buy these.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.750
No problem at all! All I can do is buy stuff, so it's the least I can do!

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.990
And here are her chains!

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.480
These were 800 yen in the Halloween section! Talk about a steal!

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.790
Plus, they're way lighter than they look. It's crazy!

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.540
I'mma go ahead and slip these on.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.750
What's this?

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.250
Add some flavor into your home Change up your room
Backdrop Sheet Oh, did this catch your eye?

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.420
It's basically wallpaper that's like a giant removable decal.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.340
You go like this, and... ta-dah!

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.340
Doesn't this part sorta look like a prison now? I'm a genius!

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.300
It does change things up quite a bit.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.560
They had all kinds of designs, so we could probably do any background!

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.790
Oh, yeah. I tried to look for some teeth, but all I could find were canines.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.400
We might have to digitally edit in those front teeth.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.460
I made the teeth for you.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.780
Uh, did I jump into a horror movie just now?

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.010
I looked it up,

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.490
and you can make these from fake nails at the 100 yen store,

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.050
so I gave it a try.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.240
Whoa, dude! Can I try 'em on?

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.200
Go ahead.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.740
How do they fit?

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.420
And done!

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.550
Well? How doof I wook?

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.300
Wow! Amazing! They look amazing!

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.200
They look way more natural than I thought they would!

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.970
Dude, too loud again.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.000
Oh, sorry. I was just really worried about how they'd turn out.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.810
It is pretty exciting, right? I totally get it.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.810
Okay, lemme get changed.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.310
I need to get this foundation on first...

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.560
Gojo-kun, could you help me get some on my back later?

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.200
It was super hard earlier.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.500
"Seeing such plump, healthy underboob makes you healthier, too."

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:38.090
I see. I think... I understand now.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.800
I see.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.040
Uh, hello?!

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.580
Your face is bright red! Did you get heatstroke?!

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.130
Huh?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.460
Oh, no! What do we do?!

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.550
No, I'm totally fine... L-Let's get you some water—

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.180
Ow! I totally hit my head!

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.890
A-A-A-A-Are you okay?!

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.890
Now I can't get my wig on!

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.560
Veronica-tya... you'll have to wait another day.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.110
Why are you so freaked out?

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.140
I-I-I never really come to Shibuya... so I feel out of place.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.880
Dude, you're totally fine!

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.440
Wh-What are we buying today?

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.360
A clothing shop?

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.470
Yup!

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.130
But isn't this... a men's apparel shop?

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.500
You seemed pretty worried before that this was your only outfit.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.280
So...

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.040
Let's buy you some clothes!

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.120
I'll be your stylist!

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.260
Do you have any styles you like?

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.310
Um... Not particularly.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.930
I'm not exactly sure how to pick out clothes.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.740
Starting from zero, huh?

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.900
All right. Let's just try on a bunch.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.700
What about this? Go ahead and try it on.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.500
Excuse me, sir!

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.530
Yes?

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.230
Are you done?

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.770
N-Not yet.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.580
Can I sneak a peek?

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.910
P-Please, not yet!

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.110
Dude, she's insanely hot.

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.280
Is the guy in there her boyfriend? Nah, no way...

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.700
I-I'm done.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.890
Ooh, lemme see!

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.920
What's with the formality? Is he an underclassman?

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.680
Hey, that looks great on you!

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.010
I wanna die just looking at him!

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.930
Let me know if you need anything!

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.140
Ah, yeah...

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.060
Okay, got it. I'll bring you some other things, so try 'em on, okay?

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.450
Holy crap. What am I supposed to do?

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.670
I totally wuv him in every single one!

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.570
But seriously, what the eff?!

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.080
He looks mad hot in every single one!

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.510
How can I choose?!

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.030
A guy that looks hot in everything actually exists?!

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.590
I mean, he's right in front of me.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.330
I seriously can't right now! Can't! Can't! Can't!

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.300
I love him so much! I wuv you! Gojo-kun, I wuv you to death!

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.190
Kitagawa-san, can I take this off now?

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.450
Huh?! Why, though?!

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.450
I f-feel really uncomfortable.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.780
It's a really nice shirt that I wouldn't usually wear, so...

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.400
For real?

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.290
Then how about a plain ol' T-shirt?

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.030
Not so intimidating, right?

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.790
Right... It's super cute, so I'll try on the same one.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.400
Wouldn't it be too big for you?

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.500
I actually wear men's sizes any time I wanna wear baggy clothes.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.040
I had no idea...

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.520
And... If Gojo-kun ends up liking this shirt,

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.840
I'll be able to match with the boy that I wuv!

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.130
For real?!

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.810
You'd seriously do that?!

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:36.770
Gawd, you're embarrassing!

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:38.550
How hilarious!

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.340
Did you put it on, Gojo-kun?

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.020
Y-Yes... I'm gonna wear it like this!

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.810
What about you, Gojo-kun?

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:46.960
You likey?

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.960
I likey... Dude, your face! You're a hella bad liar!

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.970
That'd probably look good on you, too!

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.780
Why are you that freaked?

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.730
I'm getting a bit hungry.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.580
Wanna take a break somewhere and have a little snack?
Shibuya Shop Chuka Soba Like ramen!

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:03.840
Ramen is a "little" snack?!

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.970
Shibuya Center Gai

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.590
I'm sorry... And you picked out so many options for me, too.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:26.780
Oh, it's totally fine.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.410
What can ya do if none of them felt right?

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.190
Oh, yeah. The bump on my head's gone down,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.230
so when should we do Veronica-tya's cosplay?

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.450
I'll have to pass.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.330
You'll have to do that one yourself, Kitagawa-san.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:46.940
Huh?

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.080
Why, though?

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.990
I can't cosplay without you, Gojo-kun.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.120
What are you even talking about?

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.530
Explain it to me!

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.630
I'm sorry, I just can't this time.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.350
It's my fault.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:13.040
I hadn't thought about what might happen when you put it on...

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.770
Compared to all the other cosplays...

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.780
Y-Your chest...

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.450
The amount of fabric on it is far less than before!

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.750
Sushi Toto Japan Mugi suke So I won't be able to look.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.270
God!
Hey—

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.300
You made it sound all serious, so I didn't know what to expect!

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.770
Ohmigod, stop! That's why?!

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.050
You scared the crap outta me!

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:52.020
So, you got all embarrassed thinking about my underboob?

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.800
Jeez, you little perv!

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.940
Kitagawa-san! Y-You're being too loud!

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.370
Well...

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.320
I guess Veronica-tya does show a lot of skin...

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.260
Yes, very much so.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.450
I didn't really think about it when I saw her in the game.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.880
I'll put more thought into the next character I choose.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.330
I'm very sorry about this.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.230
But...

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.670
You did go through the trouble of making that cosplay, so maybe I'll wear it at home.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.850
Oh, yes. Please, go right ahead.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.640
Want me to send you a pic of me wearing it?

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:59.970
Wait—I-I-I... Dude, I'm totally kidding!

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.920
I won't send it, dummy.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.020
Episode 11

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.300
I Am Currently at a Love Hotel Next time.
