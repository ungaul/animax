WEBVTT

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.820
Wow...

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.940
Ain't they beauties?

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.260
Your ol' gramps and his friends made these hina dolls.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.060
Ain't that amazing?

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.280
Uh-huh. Wow...

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.060
They're so pretty.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.540
She's the most beautiful thing in the world...

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.150
With a little bit of practice, you'll be just like your Gramps.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.060
That's so creepy!

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.770
Why do you like girls' dolls, Wacchan? You're a boy.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.490
I hate you, Wacchan!

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.640
Morning.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.180
You're still as beautiful as ever.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.580
My Dress-Up Darling

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.950
Episode 1
Someone Who Lives in the Exact Opposite World as Me

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.460
Gojo Dolls

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.090
Tatematsu

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.580
Morning, Gramps.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.100
Morning, Wakana.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.930
Wakana, you were working late again last night, weren't you?

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.450
Are you getting enough sleep?

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.080
Well... I was just on a roll, so I kept going.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.880
My brush just wouldn't stop and I ended up painting a handful of them.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.600
Still, I can't get them perfect like you, Gramps.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.690
How many years do you think I've been doing this?

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.810
Hm...

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.320
47?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.850
48!

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.220
Let's eat.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.330
Even if you haven't mastered the faces yet,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.640
you can make their costumes, and that's plenty impressive.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.660
That's all I'm good at, though.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.940
I've still got lots to learn.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.530
No need to hurry.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.850
Just keep at it.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.620
You're still in school.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.530
Yeah...

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.030
By the way...

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.370
Have you made any friends now that you're in high school?

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.260
You okay?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.980
I'm fine... Wait.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.670
Where'd this come from?

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.430
Well, I mean...

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.680
You spent all your time messing with dolls throughout grade and middle school.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.430
I started wondering if you actually had any friends.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.010
Y-Yeah, of course I have friends!

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.660
Lots of 'em. I've always had friends.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.480
They're all busy with clubs, so our schedules never line up.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.690
That's all.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.680
Really.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.820
I see.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.830
Welp, I definitely feel better.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.160
I see, I see.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.140
That's great.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.410
Gojo Dolls I'm heading out.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.280
Yup.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.000
Be careful.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.040
I will.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.660
Man, I hate first period.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.470
Seriously.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.660
We're totally gonna get yelled at.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.140
Heyo!

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.030
M-My bad!

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.520
I thought you were someone else!

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.780
Sorry, Gramps.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.280
I still...

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.750
haven't made a single friend, even in high school.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.880
How can I, anyway?

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.360
My dream is to be a kashirashi for hina dolls.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.950
Meaning, my hobbies are...

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.950
Creating hina dolls and honing my craft.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.710
Appreciating my work.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.540
You're as lovely as ever.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.160
And talking to said work.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.850
And so, I have nothing to talk about with other people!
Where should we start today?

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.140
Did you see episode 6 yesterday?

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.940
Of Chiretsu?

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.620
Dude, it was epic!

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.060
The animation was godlike!

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.480
At the tournament the other day, our coach...

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.530
That voice actor was just... Wait, what?

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.030
I have no idea what that means!

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.320
What I like is so different from everyone else...

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.930
Heyo.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.620
Hey.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.460
I'd just make things super awkward and make everyone feel uneasy around me.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.220
It'd be better...

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.440
if I just wasn't here...

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.560
Whoa, wait!

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.190
That... hurt!

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.280
My bad, Marin!

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.530
Yikes, sorry.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.530
Are you okay?!

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.190
You okay?

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.570
Ow... Yeah, I think I'm fine...

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.310
Oh, sorry.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.370
Um... Gojo-kun.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.080
K-Kitagawa-san!

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.380
U-Uh, um... You good?

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.850
Y-Yes!

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.920
Oh, hey.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.680
You've got something on you.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.060
What the heck is this?

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.750
It's not like a cut... right?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.810
This is, um... This is fine.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.560
What's fine, exactly?!

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.360
Really?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.030
That's good, then.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.820
You good, Marin?

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.470
Definitely broke some bones on that landing.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.640
Oh, please.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.660
Ink...

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.700
I had no idea I still had some on me.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.670
Man, that startled me...

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.100
That's the first time I've ever talked to her.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.680
Kitagawa-san.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.260
She's super cheerful, has a lot of friends,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.100
and is always the center of attention.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.760
She lives in a completely different world than as me.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.860
So, after school yesterday...

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.840
Ugh. Are you really going to bring that up?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.020
Wow, you actually got Marin to hang out with you after school?

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.450
She always runs off somewhere.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.600
She had to go to a hair modeling gig, so I went with her.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.870
And I wanted a haircut.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.080
Ah, so it was work.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.750
But then, this dude totally waited on Marin even though his hair was done ages ago.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.010
My dude, just go home.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.770
Was he cute, though?

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.220
He was actually pretty hot.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.460
He finally came up to us as we were about to leave.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.100
I'm sure he was just trying to start up a conversation, but...

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.020
Hey, isn't that thing from some anime?

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.770
Wow, you're a total nerd.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.150
Talk about lame.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.070
The only thing that's lame here is you.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.510
And then, she never looked back.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.530
Seriously? Brutal.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.730
Ouch.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.530
He looked like his soul had left his body!

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.770
I mean...

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.790
If the guy was hot, maybe you should've given him a chance.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.990
Marin's basically an ice queen whenever anyone tries to hit on her, anyway.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.010
Like I care about how hot he was.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.610
I just can't deal with guys like him.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.140
I mean, he clearly knew it was something I liked before he opened his mouth.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.490
You just don't go making fun of things people clearly like.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.510
Right?
For sure.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.910
Also... how dare he call Shion-tan "that thing"?!

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.850
Here we go... Her deep love for Shion-tan.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.700
Look, we don't understand when you talk about this stuff, either.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.020
Right here in this classroom...

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.630
There's someone who lives in the exact opposite world as me.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.820
Sakuya-kun Mirai-chan Shion-tan
She lives in a world where she's accepted for who she is.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.120
It must be... really comfortable in that world.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.460
For real?!

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.100
You'll do it again?

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.500
Yeah, sure.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.330
You're a lifesaver!

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.120
Come on.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.170
You really should do it today.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.080
Aw, but Gojo says he'll do it.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.630
And I don't wanna be late for work.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:19.740
Thanks, Gojo!

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.990
See you later!

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.030
Hey!

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.040
Sorry, Gojo.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.770
I'll buy you something to drink sometime.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.530
Honestly, doing this all on my own is pretty rough.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.130
But...

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.140
This is way better than me failing at conversations

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.430
and making things awkward.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.860
I'm sure they wouldn't know what to talk about with me around.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.510
And I'd make them uncomfortable if I just stood around quietly.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.540
I'm just gonna hurry and finish up so I can go home.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.270
It's Kitagawa-san.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.860
I wonder if she forgot something.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.560
What?

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.230
Huh?

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.080
Uh, nothing...

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.300
Um, what are you doing?

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.130
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.160
I'm cleaning.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.800
I'm late 'cause I had to go to the bathroom, but I'm on cleaning duty this week.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.120
Huh?!

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.910
Y-You're actually going to clean?

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.630
Of course I am.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.870
Why wouldn't I?

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.900
Hey, where's everyone else?

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.800
Oh, they went home.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.400
I guess they had work.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.420
Seriously?

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.650
All of them?

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.340
Yes...

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.800
Gojo-kun, are they taking advantage of you?

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.350
I guess so.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:55.520
You guess so?!

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.760
And you're still doing this?

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.790
You don't mind?!

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.780
I mean... I sort of do... Of course you would.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.430
Did you tell them that?

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.320
No...

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.380
But they said that I was reliable,

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.410
so I thought it was okay.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.530
That's not being reliable.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.220
They're just using you.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.260
You shouldn't agree to things you don't wanna do.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
No, really. You need to think about yourself more.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.550
You need to speak up about how you're feeling, for your own sake.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.690
Gojo Dolls Ow!

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.820
Hey, what happened? You okay?

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.640
Oh...

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.310
Sorry.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.790
I cut my finger again.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.360
You gotta be careful!

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.430
I wonder if we have any bandages left.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.220
You just sit tight.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.390
Thanks...

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.920
It's been days...

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.840
You need to speak up about how you're feeling, for your own sake.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.680
...but her words are still in my head.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.120
She saw right through me.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.770
I've always suppressed my feelings.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.240
Even...

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.050
Back then...

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.270
Huh?

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:35.370
Here.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.930
Slap this on there.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.340
Gramps, the sewing machine's not working.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.930
Well, it's pretty much an antique.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.010
It was on its last leg.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.240
I guess it's time to buy a new one.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.920
I wish I'd gotten to a good stopping point, at least.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.540
Oh, I know.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.940
Sewing Practice Room

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.440
It's so easy to use.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.860
Thank goodness we don't have an Arts and Crafts Club...

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.240
It's not like anyone's gonna come here after school, so I won't have to hide.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.870
And I can bring you.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.930
I'll sew your outfit for you today.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.030
Just you wait.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.100
K-Kitagawa-san!

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:38.820
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.480
Are you hurt—

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.450
Shit...

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.200
What the hell?

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:58.660
It's all over...

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.380
That's so awesome!

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.340
You know how to use a sewing machine, Gojo-kun?

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.340
Huh?

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.640
The sewing machine!

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.320
How do you know how to use one? We don't have home ec as an elective!

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.030
Uh... Um...

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.720
My family runs a hina doll shop.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.790
So... I learned how to use one as a kid.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.900
Oh, that's why?! No wonder!

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.090
Hey, is that a hina doll?

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.050
Lemme see!

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.230
Uh... Um...

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:31.240
Here you go.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.810
Look at this hottie.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.040
Her eyes are sparkling.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.130
This is the first time...

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.980
This is the first time someone's complimented...

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.380
The first time someone complimented something I love.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.330
Did you make this hina doll, Gojo-kun?

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.510
Uh, no, I didn't.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.900
My gramps made her.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.140
I-I still only know how to make their clothes.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.520
You can make clothes?

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.490
Um, yes.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.300
For real?

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.130
Yes. I mean, I just sew them together, so it's not a big deal—

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.840
Hey... Could you look the other way?

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.140
Yes, ma'am!

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.150
Wha—Wh-Wh-Wh-What's going on?!

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.190
What's happening?!

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.260
Why is she undressing?!

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.000
Wait.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.440
Why do I hear a rustling sound?

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.780
What is this sound?!

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:40.700
Gojo-kun.
Yes, ma'am!

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.880
H-How can I help you?

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.440
Look at me.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.980
But... It's okay. Just look.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.460
I'm still not done with it.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.100
It's totally not done yet, but, um...

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.890
What do you think?

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:11.680
Huh?

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.150
Um, what do you mean?

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.430
What exactly are you wearing?

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.680
Well...

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.480
I'm, uh, trying to make that outfit... so, yeah.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.060
At least I'm trying to.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.020
You're joking, right?

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.860
Huh? I'm totally serious.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.320
I worked really hard on this.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.950
But, I mean... It doesn't look like this at all!

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.290
No one could suck this bad even if they tried!

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.230
Huh?!

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.380
That material needs a lining, doesn't it?

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.540
Lining... What?

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.890
You don't even know that?!

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.340
Unbelievable.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.920
Please excuse me.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.350
I knew it.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.080
You haven't done any of the reverse stitching,

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.260
and it's wrinkled!

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.650
And there's no bobbin thread!

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.560
You can hardly even call this sewing.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.930
I bet you forgot your seam allowance, too!

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.150
Oh, come on!

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.600
Why did you change the tension dial here?!

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.560
And—

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.850
I-I'm so sorry, I went way too far!

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.610
Please, just kill me now!

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:21.920
Wait, what?!

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.720
What are you even doing?! Quit it!

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.300
H-H-How much should I pay you?

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.050
Nothing!
I don't want any!

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.240
I'm not mad!

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.380
Not even a little!

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.060
But seriously, Gojo-kun, could you look up?

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.950
Um... You see...

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.690
I made this because I wanted to cosplay!

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.600
Cosplay?

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.240
Yup! Cosplay!

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.200
I want to wear the same things as manga, anime, and game characters!

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:08.230
Cosplaying allows you express just how much you love your faves!

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.360
Isn't that awesome?!

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.040
It's basically... the ultimate form of love!

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.360
Are you listening, Gojo-kun?

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:16.890
Yes!

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.760
I'm sorry! I'm absolutely listening! I'm sorry!

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.370
And...

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:26.280
I don't have a sewing machine at home, so I was working on this here after school.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.250
But, well...

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.280
As you can see, it's not in the best shape,

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.640
and I don't know anyone who's good at sewing.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.440
Gojo-kun!

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.700
Will you make me a cosplay outfit?

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.650
Huh?

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.400
If you can't...

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.080
You can just tell me you can't.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.160
You see...

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.820
I can't do much more on my own.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.760
But Shizuku-tan means so much to me...

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.230
She means so much to me, so I want to become her, no matter what!

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.990
Please, Gojo-kun!

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.810
That's so awesome!

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.070
You know how to use a sewing machine, Gojo-kun?

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.740
Look at this hottie.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.370
You just don't go making fun of things people clearly like.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.720
You need to speak up about how you're feeling, for your own sake.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.220
All right.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.680
I've never made clothes for an actual person before,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.480
so I'm not sure how well it'll go,

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.530
but I'll do everything I can.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.290
You mean...

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.880
You'll do it?

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.670
Yes.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.840
For real?

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.800
Yes.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.570
Yes!

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.400
Yes, yes, yes!

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.560
Yay!

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.170
Shizuku-tan!

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.880
Now I can be Shizuku-tan!

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.470
Right here in this classroom...

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.860
There's someone who lives in the exact opposite world as me.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.700
I never thought...

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.470
I'd make a promise like this with someone like that.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.170
I'm seriously crying right now.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.170
Oh! But I'll do everything I can!

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.950
Not that I can do much!

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.030
Sure.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.600
I guess you really want to be this person.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.870
Yup! I mean, she's just too precious for words!

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.580
Shizuku Kuroe-tan from

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.090
